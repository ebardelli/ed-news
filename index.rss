        <title>Anxiety in the mathematics classroom: reciprocal relations with control and value, and relations with subsequent achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students’ attitudes can be influential in the emotions experienced in mathematics learning and achievement at school. Two important judgements, according to Control-Value Theory are degree of control a student has over, and the value attached to, learning activities or outcomes. Appraisals of control and value are believed to play a central role in the emotions experienced when learning, and subsequent achievement. Achievement, in turn, can strengthen or weaken control-value appraisals. In the present study we set out to examine the bidirectional relations between control-value appraisals and a key emotion experienced in the mathematics classroom, namely anxiety. In addition, we tested the proposition that control-value appraisals are indirectly linked to achievement, mediated by classroom-related anxiety. The participants were 1242 Year 5 students (49% female), with a mean of 9.3 years, from 24 English primary schools. Self-report data for anxiety, and control-value appraisals, were collected over two waves (separated by seven months) and mathematics achievement collected from a classroom test one week later. Results from a structural equation model showed bidirectional relations between higher anxiety and lower control. Although anxiety predicted lower value, value was unrelated to subsequent anxiety. Higher control at the first wave of measurement was related to higher mathematics achievement, mediated by lower anxiety, at the second wave. These results underscore the importance of reducing anxiety when learning mathematics and suggest that intervention could achieve this outcome by reducing anxiety directly or by strengthening control.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Student values and wellbeing in mathematics education: perspectives of Chinese primary students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Around the world the prevalence of mathematics anxiety and disengagement point to a poor sense of student ‘mathematical wellbeing’. Mathematical wellbeing is defined here as the fulfilment of one’s ultimate or core values, accompanied by positive feelings and functioning in mathematics education. Yet student wellbeing and how to support it in specific school subjects including mathematics is vastly under-researched. Also, despite outperforming other countries in international mathematics assessments, East Asian students generally appear to experience poor affect and high academic burden in mathematics education, which are indicative of poor mathematical wellbeing. In this context, this explorative and descriptive study investigates the values that are associated with the mathematical wellbeing of a cohort of Chinese primary school students. 258 Grade three students in Chengdu, China responded to a questionnaire which explored teacher-nominated mathematics learning moments that students valued most for their mathematical wellbeing. Findings pointed to students valuing all the learning moments to some extent, with good grades, fun and interest, mathematics-themed videos, and teacher praise rated most commonly for wellbeing. The values underlying these learning moments are similar to the seven mathematical wellbeing dimensions found in Australian classrooms. The findings also highlight the cultural subjectivities involved, in which the same classroom actions can reflect different underlying values across cultures, and in which a particular value can be espoused in different ways in different places. We also look ahead to suggest how teachers might support students’ mathematical wellbeing, by recognising and then fulfilling their students’ values in the mathematics classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Motivational states in an undergraduate mathematics course: relations between facets of individual interest, task values, basic needs, and effort</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;According to situated expectancy-value models, motivational variables play an important role in students’ engagement in academic mathematics courses and achievement. However, for academic mathematical learning, only a few studies provide information regarding the fluctuation of task values on different occasions (situation-specificity, state) and the extent to which task values depend on individual characteristics (personal-specificity, trait). Thus, answering these questions provides information about the extent to which adequate situational characteristics, such as relevance interventions, can influence students’ motivation to engage in the learning process. To contribute to this discussion of the situation- and personal-specificity of task values, I surveyed 181 undergraduate students attending an advanced mathematics course. These students reported on their task values and effort three times in four different lessons during a course in linear algebra. I focused on the following three questions: (1) situation-specificity: to what extent do task values fluctuate between situations (and between persons)? (2) predictions of task values: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict task values? (3) predictions of effort: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict effort? These questions were answered by applying linear mixed models. The analysis results indicate that task values fluctuate only slightly in different situations and are strongly predicted by individual characteristics, such as interest in university mathematics, and task values predict effort. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I value the problem, but I don’t think my students will: preservice teachers’ judgments of task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;According to expectancy-value models, two important motivational constructs are task value and self-efficacy expectations. As students work intensively on mathematical problems in the classroom, teachers need the competence to judge whether students value solving the problem and how confident they are that they will succeed. However, not much is known about the mechanisms behind teachers’ judgments concerning students’ motivation. The goal of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (a) How do preservice teachers rate their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (b) Are there differences in preservice teachers’ diagnostic judgments concerning &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (c) Do preservice teachers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems differ from preservice teachers’ judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy? A total of 182 preservice teachers were asked about the value of 12 problems, their confidence in solving the problems, and how hypothetical ninth graders would judge these constructs. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; perceptions regarding both constructs were lower for modelling problems than for other problems. When judging &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; motivation, ratings of both constructs were higher for word problems. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; motivation were significantly higher across all types of problems than their judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; perspectives. A positive correlation between preservice teachers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; motivation and their judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; motivation indicates the importance of teachers’ perceptions of their own motivation to solve mathematical problems for diagnostic judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marketing and School Choice: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School-choice programs may increase schools&#39; incentives for marketing rather than improving their educational offering. This article systematically reviews the literature on the marketing activities of primary and secondary schools worldwide. The 81 articles reviewed show that schools’ marketing has yet to be tackled by marketing academics or other social scientists outside the education field. Market-oriented U.S. charter schools and their international equivalents have stimulated recent research, but geographical gaps remain, particularly in countries with long-established school-choice policies and in rural areas. Schools deploy a range of marketing techniques with the intensity of activity directly correlated to the level of local competition and their position in the local hierarchy. Studies have analyzed schools’ use of market scanning, specific words and images in brochures, branding, segmentation, and targeting. These marketing activities are rarely accompanied by substantive curricular change, however, and may even contribute to social division through targeting or deceptive marketing activity.

        <title>Disrupting Three Prominent Racialized Trauma Tropes</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School-based actors can uphold racialized systems and White supremacy through the racialized youth trauma narratives they reproduce. With respect to the growing movement to better support trauma-exposed youth inside school contexts, it is imperative that school-based actors avoid perpetuating deficit views of youth of color, who are disproportionately overexposed to traumatic experiences. Drawing on the youth trauma literature and personal experiences with educators, this essay outlines three common trauma tropes: (a) the hearing gunshots trope, (b) the socioeconomic myth trope, and (c) the what happened to them trope. These narratives are viewed as tropes because they function as rhetorical tools that ignite White-racialized ideological responses and perpetuate the racial status quo. In closing, the author shares four recommendations to better support trauma-exposed youth and provides empirical pathways for researchers to further study the race-trauma nexus.

        <title>Believing in Your Own Abilities: What Namibian High School Students Experiencing Mathematics Difficulties Can Teach Us</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we explore beliefs about teaching and learning held by 27 Namibian 11th graders (ages 16 to 18) experiencing difficulties in learning mathematics. Namibia’s education system and its people’s access to mathematics has suffered throughout years of colonization and apartheid. Namibia has made significant strides to create access and improve learning experiences. Its complex history provides a powerful context for exploring the beliefs and experiences of learners who persist despite experiencing difficulties. This research focuses specifically on learners experiencing mathematical difficulties, as the equity concerns of mathematics for these students are exacerbated through their experienced difficulties. While research on beliefs in mathematics education has been steadily growing, scant research has been conducted on the beliefs of learners experiencing persistent mathematics difficulties. Mathematics is recognized as a barrier to accessing higher education opportunities, and this research makes an important contribution to understanding the beliefs and resilience of Namibian learners experiencing mathematics difficulties. Understanding the beliefs and experiences of learners who continue to persist through their experienced difficulties can provide important insight into how to help and support all learners. The participants in this study shared their beliefs regarding experiences that would help them persist in their mathematics learning and their beliefs regarding systemic aspects of the Namibian schooling system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deeper than Wordplay: A Systematic Review of Critical Quantitative Approaches in Education Research (2007–2021)</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although the critical research cannon is often associated with qualitative scholars, there is a growing number of critical scholars who are refusing positivist-informed quantitative analyses. However, as a growing number of education scholars engaged in critical approaches to quantitative inquiry, instances of conflation began to surface. We understood this conflation as the interchangeable use of the terms quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical quantitative throughout the literature and even within the same chapter or article. The purpose of our systematic literature review is twofold: (a) to understand how critical approaches to quantitative inquiry emerged as a new paradigm within quantitative methods and (b) whether there is any distinction between quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical quantitative inquiries or simply interchangeable wordplay. We share how critical quantitative approaches are definite shifts within the quantitative research paradigm, highlight relevant assumptions, and share strategies and future directions for applied practice in this emergent field.

        <title>Student noticing of collaborative practices: exploring how college students notice during small group interactions in math</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Over the last three decades, educational researchers and policymakers have increasingly promoted instructional strategies that centralize group work in mathematics. One difficulty teachers face in implementing group-based instruction in mathematics involves facilitating meaningful group interaction amongst students. In this paper, we explore student noticing as a novel strategy for supporting college students to collaborate effectively during group work in mathematics. First, we construct a noticing framework named &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;student noticing of collaborative practices&lt;/em&gt; which provides a lens for “seeing” how students notice their collaborative practices. Then, we use the framework to explore how 25 college students noticed their collaborative practices in mathematics. After working on a novel mathematics task in groups, the college students listened to audiorecordings of their group interactions and responded to reflection questions about the effectiveness of their collaboration. We identified themes regarding how and what students noticed related to their collaborative practices. The findings reveal that students attended to many aspects of their collaboration, including their talking turns and propensity to listen to others. Students demonstrated a desire to change their collaborative practices in the future. The findings imply that teachers and researchers might leverage student noticing as a tool for improvement in mathematics group-based classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The role of the partitioning and coset algorithm quotient group partial meanings in comprehending the First Isomorphism Theorem and its proof</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In many advanced mathematics courses, comprehending theorems and proofs is an essential activity for both students and mathematicians. Such activity requires readers to draw on relevant meanings for the concepts involved; however, the ways that concept meaning may shape comprehension activity is currently undertheorized. In this paper, we share a study of student activity as they work to comprehend the First Isomorphism Theorem and its proof. We analyze, using an onto-semiotic lens, the ways that students’ meanings for quotient group both support and constrain their comprehension activity. Furthermore, we suggest that the relationship between understanding concepts and proof comprehension can be reflexive: understanding of concepts not only influences comprehension activity, but engaging with theorems and proofs can serve to support students in generating more sophisticated understanding of the concepts involved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Methodologies to reveal young Australian Indigenous students’ mathematical proficiency</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A 7-month mathematics proficiency program was conducted in a primary Australian Indigenous community school. This paper focuses on outlining the specific methodologies employed to explore how students’ mathematical proficiency changed throughout the implementation of the program in Years 2 to 4 (~ 7 to 9 years old). A mixed methods research design was utilised, and findings will be presented to evidence how the combination of standardised tests, diagnostic tests, and Newman interviews were useful in capturing and making visible young Indigenous student’s mathematical proficiency. Whilst standardised tests provided a useful and comparable measure of student achievement, diagnostic tests and Newman interviews gave space for Indigenous student voice and demonstrated their strengths and areas for improvement in relation to their conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and strategic competence. From these findings, recommendations concerning the adjustment of data collection procedures for young students in this setting are presented. The findings question the accuracy of standardised tests in revealing young students’ proficiency, and this has implications for the extent to which standardised tests are relied upon to inform educational reform particularly for Indigenous students. Striving for equitable educational outcomes is an important endeavour in Australia, and such undertakings must be driven by meaningful and accurate evidence of students’ proficiency in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making Change Can Be Hard: Some Penniless Thoughts on Those “Damn Kids These Days…”</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Constantly on the lookout for Canadian mathematics education matters, because if Canadian mathematics education matters then Canadian mathematics education matters, three young university bookstore employees, university students, unable to make proper change when I handed them a five dollar bill for a sticker I was purchasing for my laptop, absolutely crushed my spirit. As they say though, it is not what happens to you, rather it is how you react to what happened to you. As such, rising from what I am now calling “the sticker incident,” this article is a many part investigation into the oft-heard phrase “Damn kids these days cannot make change without a calculator.” Under examination: the subtraction skills of a particular subset of adult employees not often asked to prove their arithmetic resolve; detailing a personal mistake I made while making change in a big spot; recounting a retelling of a mistake that has haunted someone for many years; detailing which particular customers cashiers need to be worried about when making change (old men with coin purses); wonderings as to why stories about making change do not reflect our now penniless country; and, a brief look at the future responsibilities of cashless immigrants. With this particular matter now in the rearview mirror, I am back in the wild looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>School Inclusion of Refugee Students: Recent Trends From International Data</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As children with refugee backgrounds continue to enroll in schools worldwide, attention to their educational needs and experiences has increased. In this study, we analyze the extent that schools and classrooms provide refugee students with equitable educational opportunities compared to students who are not refugees, and whether their teachers feel prepared for and engaged in culturally responsive instructional practices. Using survey data on 130,803 teachers and 8,054 schools sampled from 41 predominantly distant resettlement host countries in the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey, we find lower levels of resources, safety, and social inclusion for refugee students but higher levels of preparation and instructional practices in multicultural education among their teachers. The results have policy implications for supporting students with refugee backgrounds in different school contexts.

        <title>Different or Differentiated? Recoupling Policy and Practice in an Era of Accountability</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Differentiation is an instructional practice teachers employ to modify their classroom content, process, and products based on student readiness, interest, and learning profile. Many school districts recognize the benefits of differentiated instruction and thus mandate allotted classroom time for its implementation. In this article, we investigate how teachers in one such district resolved differentiation policy to practice in a high-stakes testing environment. We found, during the designated time for differentiation, teachers regularly remediated small groups but did not similarly address the academic needs of advanced students, thus not enacting the disciplinary standard for differentiation. We suggest teachers are recoupling practice and policy but misaligning it to the disciplinary definition of differentiation, which we contend has broader implications for instructional policymaking.

        <title>The Choice and Evaluation of Sexual Harassment Interventions in Institutions of Higher Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This paper provides a qualitative review of research related to sexual harassment interventions employed in institutions of higher education (IHEs) and introduces a needs assessment process that IHE administrators can use to inform their choice of intervention. Additionally, this paper provides direction regarding how to assess the impact of sexual harassment interventions as prevention programs can only be effective if they are continuously evaluated. This review may help researchers identify under researched sexual harassment related topics in higher education and IHE administrators make evidence-based decisions related to the choice, implementation, and assessment of sexual harassment interventions.

        <title>Teacher Selection Instruments and Teacher Value-Added: Evidence From Peru</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we explore whether the evaluation instruments used in the teacher selection process in Peru are good predictors of teacher effectiveness. To this end, we estimate teacher value-added (TVA) measures for public primary school teachers and test their relationship with Peru’s results of two rounds of the teacher evaluation (i.e., a centralized national stage and a decentralized stage performed at the school level). Our findings indicate that among the instruments that comprise the national stage of the process, the logical reasoning and curricular and pedagogical knowledge subtests have the strongest relationship with the TVA measure, while the weakest relationship is found with the reading comprehension component. Also, we find that the weighted aggregate score has a higher relationship with estimated TVA than the specific subtests. At the school-level stage, we find no significant relationships with our measures of TVA for math, as well as a nonrobust relationship for the classroom observation and interview evaluation instruments for reading. Moreover, we find relationships between our TVA measure and several teacher characteristics: TVA is higher for female teachers and for those at higher salary levels while it is lower for teachers with temporary contracts. These results provide lessons for the design and implementation of evaluation instruments in teacher hiring processes around the world.

        <title>Charter Schools and the Segregation of Students by Income</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The share of students attending charter schools has been rising. There is evidence that charter school growth has increased socioeconomic segregation of students between schools. In this paper, we assess whether charter school growth affects how students are organized within nearby traditional public schools (TPS). We use administrative data from North Carolina to estimate the impact of charter school openings on segregation by income within nearby TPS. Our models exploit variation in the presence and location of charter schools over time between 2007 and 2014 for students in Grades 3 to 8. We find limited evidence that the segregation of students by income at the classroom level increases when charters open nearby. We find some evidence of increasing segregation in third grade and fourth grade math and third grade ELA classrooms at TPS within 2 miles of new charters in large urban districts schools. Our results vary somewhat depending on how we control for underlying trends and measure segregation. We find no effect of charter school growth on income segregation in higher grades.

        <title>Resource for Self-Determination or Perpetuation of Linguistic Imposition: Effects of English Learner Classification Among Alaska Native Students*</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Federal law defines eligibility for English learner (EL) classification differently for Indigenous students compared with non-Indigenous students. To be EL-eligible, non-Indigenous students are required to have a non-English primary language. Indigenous students, by contrast, can be English-dominant or English monolingual. A critical question, therefore, is how EL classification impacts Indigenous students’ educational outcomes. This study explores this question for Alaska Native students, drawing on data from five Alaska school districts. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find preliminary evidence that among students who score near the EL classification threshold in kindergarten, EL classification has a large negative impact on Alaska Native students’ academic outcomes in the third and fourth grades. Negative impacts are not found for non–Alaska Native students.

        <title>The Impact of Performance Funding Policy Design on College Access and Selectivity</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study draws on a comprehensive performance-based funding (PBF) dataset and up-to-date difference-in-differences econometrics to examine the impacts of specific policy features (e.g., share of institutional revenue at stake and equity metrics) on college access and selectivity. We find suggestive evidence that increases in the share of revenue at stake are associated with decreases in racially minoritized student enrollment. Meanwhile, equity metrics may not be enough to boost enrollment among underserved students. Ultimately, however, our conclusions are limited due to various potential sources of bias, unconvincing pre-trends, and wide confidence intervals. While findings offer limited insight into the impacts of specific design features, they point to limitations of PBF—regardless of design—in expanding access and reducing inequities at 4-year colleges.

        <title>Engaging a Kanaka ʻŌiwi Literature Review Methodology Through Research on Native Hawaiian Culture-Based Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although research shows that critical outcomes occur for Native students when culture-based education (CBE) centers self-determination, sovereignty, and Indigeneity, Kanaka ʻŌiwi (Native Hawaiian) students rarely learn about these concepts. This review thus seeks to understand how scholars operationalize self-determination and Ea (sovereignty, life) in research on Native Hawaiian CBE and the extent to which this operationalization provides pathways for students to internalize the two concepts, self-identify as Indigenous, and enact praxis. By foregrounding Kānaka ways of knowing and being, a Kanaka ʻŌiwi literature review methodology (KanakaʻŌiwiLRM) is conceptualized and engaged to analyze 20 literature sources. Findings indicate that self-determination and Ea are positioned as the foundations and outcomes of CBE, yet disregarded as a basis for Indigenous self-identification. This results in a call for a purposeful decolonial Native Hawaiian CBE approach that nourishes Indigenous unity and supports self-determination, Ea, and pathways toward praxis.

        <title>How Well Do High-Achieving Undergraduate Students Understand School Algebra?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this research is to investigate how well high-achieving students entering tertiary-level education in Ireland understand school algebra. As part of a larger project, a 31-item test was developed to assess first-year undergraduate students’ understanding of basic algebraic concepts. The test was administered online to students studying at least one mathematics module at tertiary level and received 327 responses. In this article, we study how the subset of high-achieving undergraduates in our sample performed on the test. The results demonstrated a very high level of understanding among students, as befits their level of study and prior achievement relative to the difficulty of the test. However, one subsection of the test stood out as being disproportionately difficult for these students. The section focused on valid solutions of equations and inequalities. The items in question are described in detail in this article as is the associated data. Our analysis shows that this topic is an area of concern even for high-achieving undergraduates and so deserves further attention. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research and details of the larger project.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Causal Latent Transition Model With Multivariate Outcomes and Unobserved Heterogeneity: Application to Human Capital Development</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In order to evaluate the effect of a policy or treatment with pre- and post-treatment outcomes, we propose an approach based on a transition model, which may be applied with multivariate outcomes and accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. This model is based on potential versions of discrete latent variables representing the individual characteristic of interest and may be cast in the hidden (latent) Markov literature for panel data. Therefore, it can be estimated by maximum likelihood in a relatively simple way. The approach extends the difference-in-difference method as it is possible to deal with multivariate outcomes. Moreover, causal effects may be expressed with respect to transition probabilities. The proposal is validated through a simulation study, and it is applied to evaluate educational programs administered to pupils in the sixth and seventh grades during their middle school period. These programs are carried out in an Italian region to improve non-cognitive skills (CSs). We study if they impact also on students’ CSs in Italian and Mathematics in the eighth grade, exploiting the pretreatment test scores available in the fifth grade. The main conclusion is that the educational programs aimed to develop noncognitive abilities help the best students to maintain their higher cognitive abilities over time.

        <title>Assessing Inter-rater Reliability With Heterogeneous Variance Components Models: Flexible Approach Accounting for Contextual Variables</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Inter-rater reliability (IRR), which is a prerequisite of high-quality ratings and assessments, may be affected by contextual variables, such as the rater’s or ratee’s gender, major, or experience. Identification of such heterogeneity sources in IRR is important for the implementation of policies with the potential to decrease measurement error and to increase IRR by focusing on the most relevant subgroups. In this study, we propose a flexible approach for assessing IRR in cases of heterogeneity due to covariates by directly modeling differences in variance components. We use Bayes factors (BFs) to select the best performing model, and we suggest using Bayesian model averaging as an alternative approach for obtaining IRR and variance component estimates, allowing us to account for model uncertainty. We use inclusion BFs considering the whole model space to provide evidence for or against differences in variance components due to covariates. The proposed method is compared with other Bayesian and frequentist approaches in a simulation study, and we demonstrate its superiority in some situations. Finally, we provide real data examples from grant proposal peer review, demonstrating the usefulness of this method and its flexibility in the generalization of more complex designs.

        <title>Special Education and Meritocratic Inclusion</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this theoretical article we present our hypothesis on the incompatibility of the inclusive education policy toward students with special educational needs with the meritocratic principle of education. If considering and recognizing the needs of these students is necessary to achieve a successful inclusive environment, we propose that this goal cannot be achieved within current educational systems driven by a meritocratic ideology. We base our rationale on social psychology theories such as system justification and backlash to argue that such incompatibility is particularly visible during the evaluation process. Finally, if we provide some incentives toward greater inclusion while considering the diverse contradictions such inclusivity generates, we also invite researchers to further empirically examine these contradictions in order to guide policy makers within their choices.
