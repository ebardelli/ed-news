        <title>Detecting Item Preknowledge Using Revisits With Speed and Accuracy</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Examinees with item preknowledge tend to obtain inflated test scores that undermine test score validity. With the availability of process data collected in computer-based assessments, the research on detecting item preknowledge has progressed on using both item scores and response times. Item revisit patterns of examinees can also be utilized as an additional source of information. This study proposes a new statistic for detecting item preknowledge when compromised items are known by utilizing the hierarchical speed–accuracy revisits model. By simultaneously evaluating abnormal changes in the latent abilities, speeds, and revisit propensities of examinees, the procedure was found to provide greater statistical power and stronger substantive evidence that an examinee had indeed benefited from item preknowledge.

        <title>Students’ voices of inclusion in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study foregrounds three students who are regarded by their teachers as being in special educational needs in mathematics (SEM) and these same students voicing what inclusion in mathematics education means to them. In this study, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;inclusion&lt;/em&gt; is defined as processes of participation. Discourse analysis was applied when analysing these students’ voices of inclusion in mathematics education in two inclusive mathematics classrooms, with both classes aiming to include every student in the mathematics education. The three main Discourses which were identified were the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discourse of assessment&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discourse of being in a mathematics classroom setting&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discourse of accessibility in mathematics education&lt;/em&gt;. The analysis of the Discourses indicates that they were affected by wider sociopolitical discourses. Furthermore, when inclusion is regarded as processes of participation in mathematics education, the results indicate that participation becomes more complex. Therefore, in this process, both ideological and societal issues, as well as individual and subject-specific issues, must be considered in the educational endeavour.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The use of a scriptwriting task as a window into how prospective teachers envision teacher moves for supporting student reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The development of mathematical reasoning skills has increasingly been of focus for the teaching and learning of mathematics. This research utilizes a teaching simulation using the methodology of scriptwriting, in which prospective teachers are asked to complete a script of a dialogue from a classroom simulation involving fraction multiplication and division with justification, assisting fictional students to work through their difficulties and helping them to justify their reasoning. Such tasks allow for the examination of the prospective teacher moves to support student reasoning through their imagined action and choice of words. Scripts from forty-one prospective primary teachers were examined for the study, and five clusters based on the type of teacher move for supporting student reasoning were found. Overall, the prospective teachers emphasized the elicitation and facilitation of students’ ideas. The cluster analysis, however, provided a nuanced examination of the cohort’s teacher moves. While cluster one saw the highest incident of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;eliciting&lt;/em&gt; teacher moves, albeit only in the low potential category, clusters two and three mostly used &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;facilitating&lt;/em&gt; teacher moves, but varied in their use of high and low potential moves. Cluster four concentrated moves on &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;facilitating, eliciting,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;responding to student reasoning&lt;/em&gt;. Cluster five employed teacher moves from all main categories, with some instances of high potential moves in all categories except &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;extending student reasoning&lt;/em&gt;, which can better support reasoning. The prospective mathematics teachers’ scripts and the five clusters that were found during analysis are discussed with implications for future teacher education and the support of building mathematical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Two Years Later: How COVID-19 Has Shaped the Teacher Workforce</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The unprecedented challenges of teaching during COVID-19 prompted fears of a mass exodus from the profession. We examine the extent to which these fears were realized using administrative records of Massachusetts teachers between 2015–2016 and 2021–2022. Relative to prepandemic levels, average turnover rates were similar going into the fall of 2020 but increased by 17% (from 15.0% to 17.5%) going into the fall of 2021. The fall 2021 increases were particularly high among newly hired teachers (31% increase) but were lower among Black and Hispanic/Latinx teachers (5% increases among both groups). Gaps in turnover rates between schools serving higher and lower concentrations of economically disadvantaged students narrowed during the first 18 months of the pandemic. The same holds true for gaps in turnover between schools serving higher and lower shares of Black and Hispanic/Latinx students. Together, these findings highlight important differences in teachers’ responses to the pandemic across subgroups and the need to improve early-career retention to ensure long-term stability within the teacher workforce.

        <title>Learning to Teach Responsively Through Asynchronous Collaborative Discourse Around Video Records of Practice</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teaching practices that are responsive to student thinking are complex and challenging to learn, particularly for novice teachers. Skilled responsive teaching involves adaptive expertise, or the ability to deliberate about and respond to students’ emergent ideas. This study explored the learning of early-career teachers through participation in a video-feedback inquiry group around the enactment of a number talk routine introduced in preservice teacher education. Conceptualizing teacher learning as socially situated within a discourse community, we consider how participation in the asynchronous inquiry group supported both collective interpretations and individual growth in implementing responsive instructional practices. Findings suggest that giving and receiving asynchronous feedback provided novice teachers with opportunities to engage in dialogic conversations that involved several types of deliberation related to responsive teaching and the development of adaptive expertise. This study provides evidence of the potential of asynchronous teacher inquiry groups and the importance of giving, as well as receiving, feedback on practice.

        <title>Vector Line Integrals in Mathematics and Physics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Representational transformation diagrams&lt;/em&gt; are used to compare and contrast standard textbook presentations of vector line integrals in undergraduate courses in both mathematics and physics. These presentations are taken as the lower anchor in a learning trajectory. Two principal approaches in the lower division are identified, roughly but not entirely correlated with these two disciplines. These textbook approaches are compared to existing characterizations for (single-variable) integration in the theory literature, notably &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;adding up pieces&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;multiplicatively-based summation&lt;/em&gt;), which is generalized here to &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;chop, multiply, add&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;accumulation from rate&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;quantitatively-based summation&lt;/em&gt;; and a new characterization, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;parametric integrals&lt;/em&gt;. A review of upper-division textbooks establishes key features of an upper anchor in the learning trajectory. In conclusion, a hypothetical learning trajectory is presented, designed to scaffold student acquisition of rich concept images for vector line integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emergent Quantitative Models for Definite Integrals</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Prior research on students’ productive understandings of definite integrals has reasonably focused on students’ meanings associated to components and relationships within the standard definition of a limit of Riemann sums. Our analysis was aimed at identifying i) the broader range of productive quantitative meanings that students invoke and ii) the ways in which these meanings interact and evolve throughout successful modeling activity. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from prior classroom teaching experiments and task-based interviews with 84 students in introductory calculus courses working within 23 small groups on modeling tasks involving definite integrals. We present our results in terms of an Emergent Quantitative Models framework derived from the observation that students reasoned with different quantitative meanings when shifting between the processes and scales involved in the construction of a definite integral. Students’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;basic models&lt;/em&gt; are their quantitative interpretation of a relationship in which all of the quantities can be conceived as constant, often represented by well-known formulas, such as [distance] = [velocity]⋅[time]. For situations in which one or more quantities vary, students’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;local models&lt;/em&gt; are their reinterpretation of a basic model applied to a subregion of the phenomenon with limited variation. Students’ corresponding &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;global models&lt;/em&gt; are conceived as an accumulation of these local components. We document the primary versions of these models and provide examples of their nature and co-evolution throughout students’ modeling activity and their role in successful completion of the tasks and interpretation of definite integrals. Finally, we present a characterization of an idealized productive &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Quantitatively Based Summation&lt;/em&gt; understanding of definite integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outcome Evaluation of a Transnational Postgraduate Capacity-Building Program Using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Background: Previous studies have applied interview-oriented self-reported or peer-centered evaluation methods, rather than an objective and quantitative method, to evaluate outcome of a postgraduate capacity-building program and have mainly focused on the cognitive level. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in an international setting and report the results of the outcome evaluation for the behavioral aspect. Research Design: A case–control study. Subjects: Ninety examinees divided into 2 case–control groups: 17 program-experienced doctors and 17 control doctors in the first group, and 28 mentees of the program-experienced doctors and 28 control doctors in the second group. Measures: A six-station OSCE was implemented. The OSCE scores were measured to evaluate (1) the direct educational effect regarding learning in the first group and (2) the indirect educational effects regarding transfer in the second group. Written questionnaire and interview data were collected for qualitative analysis. Results: The quantitative results of the overall or subcomponent OSCE scores indicated no significant differences in the comparisons of the first and second case-control groups. The qualitative data indicated that the program improved participants’ medical knowledge, skills, and self-confidence, however, it also revealed limited learning environment provided by the program. Conclusions: This transnational study has demonstrated the process for introducing and successfully completing the testing of an OSCE in Laos. Discrepancy in the goals of the OSCE and the education program limited the usefulness of OSCE as an assessment tool, leading to the lack of significant differences in its results.

        <title>Linguistic Registers and Citizenship Education: Divergent Approaches to Content, Instruction, Kichwa Use, and State Relationships in Ecuador’s Intercultural Bilingual Education</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Indigenous education increasingly seeks to reclaim the institutions of state assimilation as spaces for the dissemination and support of localized forms of knowledge and language use and the valorization of alternative citizenship identities. In this study, I compare two schools in Ecuador to show how divergent ways of teaching Kichwa promote or reject state policies of language standardization and the kinds of citizens foregrounded by them. By comparing the schools’ approaches to teaching Kichwa, I call attention to linguistic registers as they carry out or contest predominant forms of citizenship. These examples provide a pathway to study inclusive language policies and classrooms and to understand the multiplicity of ways that citizenship manifestsin communication.

        <title>The development of sociomathematical norms in the transition to tertiary exam-oriented individualistic mathematics education in an East Asian context</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;
      Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates social, mathematical, and sociomathematical norms perceived by college students in an engineering mathematics course and examines the students’ sense of mathematics as signals of individual merit. Data sources include a survey and one-on-one interviews with 38 students.
