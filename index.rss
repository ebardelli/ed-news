        <title>Theory of action: The care and feeding of your mission</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-47, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; In education, we share a common commitment to supporting students’ growth and development, but we often have different ideas about what that support looks like. A theory of action describes how a specific education organization intends to work to create the outcomes it wants. Abby Javurek Andres and Chase Nordengren describe how to develop and enact a theory of action that meets the needs of the school community. The process involves bringing people together to gain understanding of the problem, learning what is going well and building a shared vision of success, and aligning communications and decision-making around the shared vision.

        <title>Beyond the pandemic accountability freeze: A conversation with Anne Hyslop</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 30-35, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Anne Hyslop, the director of policy development at All4Ed, talks about the differences between ESSA and the previous federal education law, NCLB. Hyslop, who worked on regulations and guidance of ESSA implementation at the U.S. Department of Education, also discusses the implications of the recent NAEP scores and what may happen to ESSA accountability and school improvement plans in the post-pandemic world.

        <title>How to respond to community concerns about critical race theory</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 48-53, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Many school leaders responded to the controversies over critical race theory with denial. That approach can backfire, according to Emily Hodge, Francesca López, and Joshua Rosenberg. They suggest proactive messaging, which can help prevent leaders from falling into the trap of reactively defending their practices and letting the direction of the conversation be guided by those with the most extreme views.

        <title>Be accountable for teacher diversity</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 22-23, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Rudy Ruiz and Faith Connolly propose a new accountability measure that captures the percentage of students in a school that have a teacher of a similar ethno-racial background. The measure would hold school districts accountable for the percentage of students who have a teacher who looks like them. Adding this measure would bring attention to recruiting and retaining teachers of color and improve outcomes for students of color.

        <title>Can grades be an effective form of feedback?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 36-41, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Although grades are often portrayed as detrimental to students’ motivation and interest in learning, closer analysis of the evidence indicates that when used appropriately, grades can be a meaningful and effective form of feedback. Thomas R. Guskey clarifies how studies on grades are frequently misinterpreted, explains how grades offer important but insufficient information on students’ learning progress, and describes conditions that must be met for grades to serve as a meaningful and effective form of feedback for students.

        <title>Defining, measuring, and supporting the success of equity officers</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-21, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; As more K-12 school districts have hired equity officers, questions have arisen about their role and effectiveness. A recent Heritage Foundation report, for example, found that schools with equity officers have the lowest achievement outcomes. Mary Rice-Boothe and Tanji Reed Marshall point out, however, that student achievement is not the only metric for determining the success of equity officers. When holding equity officers accountable, it’s important to be clear about the expectations for the role, establish appropriate measurements to assess their effectiveness, and provide supports that set the leaders up for success.

        <title>Abeyance agreements: Evading Accountability for disciplinary actions?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-28, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Schools across the United States use abeyance agreements as an alternative to suspension or expulsion, yet little is known about them. These agreements allow students to avoid or reduce suspensions or expulsions, if they meet the terms of the agreement and waive certain due process rights. David Perrodin argues that these agreements enable school districts to circumvent requirements to report disciplinary data, a requirement intended to ensure schools’ disciplinary practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. These agreements appear to give students on the brink of suspension a second chance, but the terms are sometimes difficult to follow, and once the terms are broken, students may be subject to suspension without due process. They also bring disciplinary investigations to a quick close, sometimes without a clear understanding of the root causes of the misbehavior. And the lack of data about abeyance agreements means that authorities lose information that is useful in identifying potential safety threats or uncovering schools’ violations of students’ rights. Perrodin argues for the elimination of abeyance agreements for school discipline or for more standardized processes that can be tracked and that do not interfere with students’ rights.

        <title>The Editor’s Note: There’s opportunity in the middle</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; School accountability programs tend to focus on students’ academic performance, as measured by standardized tests, But, as the authors in the November issue of Kappan explain, this presents an incomplete picture. Teresa Preston summarizes the arguments made in the issue on “Reframing Accountability.” These include discussions of limitations of testing, the need for other accountability measures, the use of data to promote improvement, and the importance of capacity building in any accountability system.

        <title>Beyond ‘good’ and ‘bad’: Disrupting narratives about school quality</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 6-11, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Parents and the public use accountability data to judge if schools are doing a good or a bad job educating their students. However, using the current data, schools perceived as “good” tend to be in better-resourced districts and enroll higher percentages of wealthy and white students. Schools perceived as “bad” tend to be in more economically oppressed districts and enroll higher percentages of low-income students and students of color. James Noonan and Jack Schneider suggest more equitable collection of better and more nuanced data about schools can provide more complete pictures of strengths and weaknesses and could offer a way to spur investment in under resourced schools.

        <title>School accountability: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 12-17, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Results-based school accountability has been the linchpin of education reform in the United States for at least two decades. But the COVID-19 pandemic led many schools, states, and districts to put their testing and accountability programs on hold. Chester E. Finn, Jr., argues that it is time for the accountability holiday to end and makes recommendations for how to ensure the accountability programs are effective. Requirements for effective accountability include rigorous standards; assessments and other metrics; consequences for failing to meet, meeting, and exceeding standards; and the capacity to make changes needed to improve.

        <title>First Person: Lamenting Earl — and other chronically absent students</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; When Amber Northern was a beginning teacher 30 years ago, one of her students, Earl, was in 9th-grade English for the third time. He only came to class once or twice a week and intended to quit school, with his father’s permission, once he turned 17. Northern delves into the research on chronic absenteeism and considers which, if any, evidence-based interventions might have been helpful for Earl. She finds that three strategies of the five she considered passed the test.

        <title>On Leadership: The architecture of equity</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 56-57, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; The work of a school leader can be compared to that of an architect, who must bring a team together to create something original on a solid foundation. Aaron Spence, superintendent of Virginia Beach City Public Schools, came to the district nine years ago, ready to serve the district where he’d grown up. His previous experiences in school leadership had given him a vision for equity-based transformation, but the district had a more immediate need — getting all schools accredited. Joshua P. Starr explains how focusing on this urgent need enabled him to build relationships that helped him when it was time to turn to more transformative goals. This initial work proved to be the foundation on which the new work could rest.

        <title>Under the Law: School accountability: Lessons from the courts</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-60, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; No Child Left Behind and the Every Student Succeeds Act have made accountability central to conversations about education policy. But neither statute articulates a clear vision of what constitutes “quality” or “equity” in education, nor do they include a mechanism to ensure that schools have sufficient resources to pursue that vision. For that, Bob Kim explains, we must turn to the courts. Kim discusses some of the court cases that have set out frameworks for determining whether schools are providing an adequate or equitable education and for providing the resources needed to do so.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Reimagining assessment to be accountable to the student</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 61-62, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Using narrow test scores as the only means of accountability does not serve students, teachers, or schools. Jonathan E. Collins writes that policy makers and educators should consider accountability as an education system designed to be accountable to the best version of students. This means assessing outcomes that policy makers too easily overlook. It also means allowing teachers more freedom to engage their students in more creative ways.

        <title>Career Confidential: Teacher is losing patience with misbehaving students</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 63-65, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Teachers ask counselor Phyllis Fagell for help with their interactions with students. One 3rd-grade teacher is frustrated with herself for losing her cool when students misbehave. A 6th-grade teacher wants to help a socially awkward boy in her class to improve his relationships with his peers. Another teacher wonders why her long-time principal never uses her first name.

She has been accused of turning students gay or transgender by forcing them to read and discuss books about gay and transgender youth. She describes why she makes books about students of various backgrounds and identities available to her students and why she is concerned about the accusations she and other teachers across the country are facing about the books offered to students.

        <title>Bookshelf: Kappan authors on their favorite reads</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 69-69, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; In this regular column, Kappan authors recommend books and articles that have influenced them. Emily Hodge’s book is Dog Whistle Politics by Ian Haney López, which she says makes concrete and explicit how politicians can activate and exploit people’s fear for their own political gain. Jack Schneider’s choice is Seeing Like a State by James C. Scott. The book, he says, helped him understand the relationship between educational policy and practice in new ways.

        <title>Measuring emotions in mathematics: the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M)</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Understanding the structure, antecedents, and outcomes of students’ emotions has become a topic of major interest in research on mathematics education. Much of this work is based on the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire—Mathematics (AEQ-M), a self-report instrument assessing students’ mathematics-related emotions. The AEQ-M measures seven emotions (enjoyment, pride, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, boredom) across class, learning, and test contexts (internal structure). Based on control-value theory, it is assumed that these emotions are evoked by control and value appraisals, and that they influence students’ motivation, learning strategies, and performance (external relations). Despite the popularity and frequent use of the AEQ-M, the research leading to its development has never been published, creating uncertainty about the validity of the proposed internal structure and external relations. We close this gap in Study 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 781 students, Grades 5–10, mean age 14.1 years, 53.5% female) by demonstrating that emotions are organized across contexts and linked to their proposed antecedents and outcomes. Study 2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 699 students, Grade 7 and 9, mean age 14.0 years, 56.9% female) addresses another deficit in research on the AEQ-M, the lack of evidence regarding the assumption that emotions represent sets of interrelated affective, cognitive, motivational, and physiological/expressive components. We close this gap by evaluating extended AEQ-M scales, systematically assessing these components for five core mathematics emotions (enjoyment, anger, anxiety, hopelessness, boredom). Our work provides solid grounds for future research using the AEQ-M to assess emotions and their components in the domain of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prospective primary teachers’ efficacy to teach mathematics: measuring efficacy beliefs and identifying the factors that influence them</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Prospective teachers’ mathematics efficacy beliefs affect school placement experiences and influence later teacher behaviour and subsequent student outcomes. These efficacy beliefs are open to change during initial teacher education and become more resistant to change once the teacher enters the workforce. Therefore, it is important to measure mathematics teacher efficacy early in initial teacher education and identify low efficacy beliefs. This study measured the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of 402 prospective primary teachers. Arising from Rasch analysis of the efficacy scores of these teachers, 22 participants who displayed a range of mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs were interviewed to gain insights into factors affecting these beliefs. Participants communicated greater confidence in tasks requiring procedural (tell-items) than conceptual knowledge (explain-items). Both low and high efficacy participants reported traditional experiences of mathematics teaching and learning as students. However, high efficacy participants reported mastery of mathematics within these traditional contexts, whereas their low efficacy peers did not report mastery. Furthermore, all participants reported how memories of their school mathematics experiences informed their level of efficacy when thinking about teaching mathematics, thus revealing the powerful influence of mastery experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers as designers of instructional tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This introductory article of the Special Issue themed Teachers as Designers of Instructional Tasks provides an overview of the research reported in the six articles of the issue. The articles show teachers playing a more active role in choosing and designing materials for their own instructional work thus illuminating new affordances in a number of fronts. We summarise these new utilities along the lines research, design, and professional development.
