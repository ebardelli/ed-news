        <title>Charter Authorizing, Applications, and the Needs of Historically Marginalized Students: A Cross State Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Charter school authorizers shape which charter schools open, where they open, and who they serve. We draw on principal agent theory to investigate how the priorities and practices of nine authorizers intersected with charter school applications’ attention to the needs of historically marginalized students. Using data from interviews and applications, we find authorizers vary in orientations toward equity and the ways in which they signal that orientation to charter applicants. Our analysis suggests a robust relationship between authorizer mission and the content found in charter applications, demonstrating the influence of authorizing practices on the contents of charter school applications.

        <title>How long-term emancipatory programming facilitates participatory evaluation: Building a methodology of participation through research with youth in Honduras</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Empowerment and participation are promoted as critical factors in meaningful development processes; however, action-oriented researchers face challenges in fostering genuine empowerment and meaningful participation within traditional funding cycles and research timelines. This case study illustrates a participatory methodology employed by researchers in partnership with one Honduran non-governmental organization (NGO) to conduct ‘practical’ participatory evaluation with rural Honduran youth. Through collaborative autoethnography, two components of this methodology are identified and described. The first component – ‘foundational elements’- includes the NGO’s culture of transformative participation and the organization’s attention to synergies in the insider/outsider identities of research partners. The second component includes the ability of the research team to leverage this foundation for the participatory evaluation with rural youth. Importantly, this ability was grounded in and shaped by long-term, trust-based relationships between research partners. These relationships were the catalyst for success in this participatory initiative, connecting the ‘foundational elements’ identified to the collaborative outcomes experienced. Overall, this case study contributes to current and ongoing scholarly discussions on how to facilitate meaningful participation and capability expansion in research and evaluation contexts.

        <title>Teacher Perceptions of Past Classroom Behaviors Influence Adolescents’ Receptivity and Responsiveness to a Belonging Intervention</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study shows how receptivity and responsiveness can influence the efficacy of an intervention helping adolescents reappraise worry or uncertainty following the difficult transition to middle school. The intervention was implemented at-scale in a diverse sample of sixth-grade public school district students followed through eighth grade (N = 1,180; 41% Black or Latinx; 44% low socioeconomic status). Results suggest the intervention’s effects on grade point average are confined to a racially and socioeconomically diverse subgroup of adolescents who had high teacher evaluations of their classroom behaviors in kindergarten that declined over the early elementary school years (i.e., “Disengagers”). These findings suggest that adolescents’ past school experiences with educators may bound the extent to which interventions can promote success in school.

        <title>High school mathematics teachers&#39; noticing of inequitable talk</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To make instructional decisions that interrupt inequitable talk in the classroom, teachers must notice it in the first place. In a two-year Professional Learning Experience (PLE) focused on the core practice of facilitating equitable discussions, we found that two different groups of math teachers took up the work of noticing for equity in different ways and with varying degrees of success. We analyzed teachers’ written goals for teaching, videos of their in-person classroom instruction, video recordings of their coaching sessions, and sets of video annotations. Our findings indicate that teachers who noticed for equity: (1) engaged in conversations about status and identity (2) had more student-centered goals, and (3) were more likely to select “bumpy moments” of their instruction to discuss in coaching sessions. These findings have implications for instructional coaches, teacher educators, and professional learning facilitators interested in supporting teachers with noticing inequitable talk in their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Design of Making Pre-K count and High Fives: Two-Stage, Multiyear Random Assignment at Different Levels</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The Making Pre-K Count and High 5s studies represent a recent application of a phased two-stage, multi-level design, which was used to examine the effects of two aligned math programs implemented in early childhood settings. The purpose of this paper is to describe the challenges encountered in implementing this two-stage design and to describe approaches to resolving them. We then present a set of sensitivity analyses the study team used to examine the robustness of the findings. During the pre-K year, pre-K centers were randomly assigned either to receive an evidence-based early math curriculum and associated professional development (Making Pre-K Count) or to a pre-K-as-usual control condition. In the kindergarten year, students who had been in Making Pre-K Count program classrooms in pre-K were then individually randomly assigned within schools to small-group supplemental math clubs that were designed to sustain the gains from the pre-K program, or to a business-as-usual kindergarten experience. Making Pre-K Count took place in 69 pre-K sites, comprising 173 classrooms across New York City. High 5s took place in the 24 sites that were part of the public school treatment arm of the Making Pre-K Count study and included 613 students. The study focuses on the effect of the Making Pre-K Count and High 5s programs on children’s math skills at the end of kindergarten as measured by two instruments, the Research-Based Early Math Assessment-Kindergarten (REMA-K) and the Woodcock–Johnson Applied Problems test. The multi-armed design, while logistically and analytically challenging, balanced multiple considerations of power, the number of research questions that could be answered, and efficiency of resources. Robustness checks suggest that the design created groups that were both meaningfully and statistically equivalent. Decisions to use a phased multi-armed design should consider both its strengths and weaknesses. While the design allows for a more flexible, expansive research study, it also introduces complexities that need to be addressed both logistically and analytically.

        <title>Achieving SDG-13 in the Era of Conflicts: The Roles of Economic Growth and Government Stability</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Establishing effective climate control and reducing the ecological footprint (EF) are necessary for pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal 13. In this context, it is required to enhance the understanding of various factors that can either decrease or enhance the EF. In the literature to date, limited studies on external conflicts (EX) have reported diverse results, and also the impacts of government stability (GS) on EF are less explored. This study explores the roles of external conflicts, economic growth, and government stability on EF in the context of SDG-13. The study also contributes to the literature by examining the environmental effects of government stability and external conflicts for the first time in Pakistan. This research uses time-series methodologies on data from Pakistan from 1984 to 2018 for exploring the long-run relations and causal dynamics. The results unfolded that external conflicts stimulate and Granger cause EF and therefore expand environmental deterioration. Thus, limiting conflicts is in the favor of Pakistan to achieve SDG-13. Surprisingly, government stability also poses harmful impacts on environmental quality by enhancing the EF, indicating that stable governments focus on improving economic conditions rather than environmental quality. Moreover, the study proves the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve. Policy suggestions are made to move forward in achieving SDG-13 and to evaluate the effectiveness of government environmental policies.

        <title>Response to How Teacher Education Matters</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This response to “How Teacher Education Matters” (2000) notes that the evidence base about the features of teacher education that matter for teacher effectiveness was substantial at that time and has grown stronger since. However, federal policy over the last two decades has reduced support for both preservice teacher education programs and for candidates’ financial assistance, while increasing support for alternative certification pathways that generally omit student teaching and often truncate coursework as well. One-third of teachers in recent years have entered without having completed preparation and are disproportionately assigned to schools serving low-income students and students of color. Meanwhile, recent research emphasizes the critical importance of well-designed clinical experiences with strong mentoring in high-quality settings, connected to applied coursework, as key to effectiveness. Residency programs are one emerging model that combines such experiences with financial supports, showing promise for recruiting and retaining a diverse, well-prepared set of candidates in high need fields and locations. High-performing countries like Finland and Singapore make these kinds of investments in teacher education routinely and shed light on the policy strategies needed to create a universally strong teacher education system.

        <title>What’s the “Problem of Teacher Education” in the 2020s?</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article is a rejoinder, some 20 years later, to a JTE editorial, titled “The Problem of Teacher Education.” The previous piece suggested that in response to unprecedented attention by high-level policy makers to “fixing” the “broken” system of teacher education, teacher education was treated as what I called a “policy problem” during the late 1990s and 2000s From this perspective, the goal was to identify which of the broad aspects of teacher education that could be controlled by policymakers was most likely to have a positive impact on teacher quality, defined primarily in terms of teachers’ effectiveness at producing a strong workforce for the new economy. In this new article, the author argues that now—during the 2020s—teacher education should be constructed as an “equity problem.” This means acknowledging that, despite many important and powerful multicultural and other initiatives over the last two decades, dominant educational and social policies, practices, and frames coupled with deeply institutionalized and intransigent racism, linguicism, and homophobia continue to produce educational inequality and inequity and continue to impede the recognition and representation of minoritized groups in determining shared educational values and purposes. A short list of contemporary scholarship and preparation programs/projects that construct teacher education as an “equity problem” is included.

        <title>Exploring Resources for Responsiveness to Student Thinking in Practice</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Supporting teachers’ attention and responsiveness to the substance of student thinking is increasingly emphasized across disciplines. Yet studies demonstrate how such responsiveness, in practice, is highly contextualized and often fleeting. This study conceptualizes and examines what functioned as “resources for responsiveness” within and across nine sustained cases of responsiveness in three science teachers’ inquiry-oriented classrooms. Analyses demonstrated how a diverse range of personal, social, and material/structural resources facilitated teachers’ responsiveness, with some commonalities but also much variation across teachers. These findings contribute to the field’s understanding of what may support teachers’ attention and responsiveness to student thinking and suggest the importance of (a) responsiveness in the design and facilitation of professional learning and (b) increased attention to teachers’ affect.

        <title>Ways of thinking in STEM-based problem solving</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article proposes an interconnected framework, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ways of thinking in STEM-based Problem Solving&lt;/em&gt;, which addresses cognitive processes that facilitate learning, problem solving, and interdisciplinary concept development. The framework comprises critical thinking, incorporating critical mathematical modelling and philosophical inquiry, systems thinking, and design-based thinking, which collectively contribute to adaptive and innovative thinking. It is argued that the pinnacle of this framework is learning innovation, involving the generation of powerful disciplinary knowledge and thinking processes that can be applied to subsequent problem challenges. Consideration is first given to STEM-based problem solving with a focus on mathematics. Mathematical and STEM-based problems are viewed here as goal-directed, multifaceted experiences that (1) demand core, facilitative ways of thinking, (2) require the development of productive and adaptive ways to navigate complexity, (3) enable multiple approaches and practices, (4) recruit interdisciplinary solution processes, and (5) facilitate the growth of learning innovation. The nature, role, and contributions of each way of thinking in STEM-based problem solving and learning are then explored, with their interactions highlighted. Examples from classroom-based research are presented, together with teaching implications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Support for Diverse Students Through Teacher Education Still Needs Presidential Leadership</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, Sleeter reflects on her previous article, “An Invitation to Support Diverse Students through Teacher Education.” She argues that her earlier recommendations are still valid, but changing conditions have lent them greater urgency. Research has made clear the positive impact of culturally relevant curriculum and pedagogy on students of color. Although White teachers still dominate the profession, White students are no longer in the majority. But schools are still highly racially segregated, with unequal access to resources, and school closures coupled with increased online education have only widened racial gaps. Because of these conditions, she argues that public education needs federal leadership.

        <title>Challenges and Tradeoffs of “Good” Teaching: The Pursuit of Multiple Educational Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The pursuit of multiple educational outcomes makes teaching a complex craft subject to potential conflicts and competing commitments. Using a data set in which teachers were randomly assigned to classes paired with videotaped lessons, we both document and unpack such a tradeoff. Upper-elementary teachers who excel at raising students’ math test scores often are less successful at improving student-reported engagement in class (and vice versa). Furthermore, teaching practices that improve test scores (e.g., cognitively demanding content) can simultaneously decrease engagement. At the same time, paired quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal two areas of practice that support both outcomes: active mathematics with opportunities for hands-on participation, physical movement, and peer interaction; and established routines and procedures to proactively organize the classroom. In addition to guiding practice-based teacher education, our sequential, explanatory mixed-methods analysis can serve as a model for rigorously studying and identifying dimensions of “good” teaching that promote multidimensional student development.

        <title>The Effect-Size Benchmark That Matters Most: Education Interventions Often Fail</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;It is a healthy exercise to debate the merits of using effect-size benchmarks to interpret research findings. However, these debates obscure a more central insight that emerges from empirical distributions of effect-size estimates in the literature: Efforts to improve education often fail to move the needle. I find that 36% of effect sizes from randomized control trials of education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes are less than 0.05 SD. Publication bias surely masks many more failed efforts from our view. Recognizing the frequency of these failures should be at the core of any approach to interpreting the policy relevance of effect sizes. We can aim high without dismissing as trivial those effects sizes that represent more incremental improvement.

        <title>We need to know more about CTE teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-23, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Over the past year, debates over the prevalence, distribution, and effects of teacher vacancy and underqualification have dominated many education narratives. Authors J. Cameron Anglum, Andrew R. Diemer, Walter G. Ecton, and Tuan D. Nguyen consider these debates in the context of growing interest in career and technical education (CTE) in high school settings. Research on secondary CTE teachers, including the quantification of teacher shortages in specific CTE content areas, remains insufficient to inform effective recruitment and retention policies. This dearth of scholarship on CTE teachers undermines the improvement of CTE programs.

        <title>Teacher academies that make a difference NOW</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-28, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;A majority of students in career and technical education teacher academies indicate that they do not want to be educators. Recognizing this, Skyline High School propelled its teacher academy program in a new direction and redesigned it in a way that is mutually beneficial to the teacher academy students, preK-12 learners, and the education workforce. R. Lennon Audrain and Gregory Mendez recount how, working in close partnership with its district human resources department and Arizona State University, Skyline’s teacher academy students develop pedagogical content knowledge about the science of reading, apply it tutoring experiences at a local elementary school, and earn industry credentials that signal specialized knowledge and skills.

        <title>Advantages of career learning in the early grades: A conversation with Ed Hidalgo</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 29-33, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Career exploration traditionally starts in middle school. However, there are advantages to starting discussions about career and preference in the early grades. California’s Cajon Valley Union School District is using the World of Work curriculum systemically from kindergarten to high school. Children learn about their personality types, do activities related to professions, and hear from professionals. Ed Hidalgo, who developed the curriculum and helped put it into practice at Cajon Valley, talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the advantages of starting in the early grades, as well as the importance of encourage students to understand and explore their strengths and preferences.

        <title>How to make more valid decisions about assessment data</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 34-39, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Those asked to make valid decisions with data don’t have the technical knowledge to understand nuance around data quality, assessment aims, and statistical limitations that influence how they should interpret the data. This reality is what Greg Thompson, Leslie Rutkowski, and David Rutkowski call the validity paradox. Educators can surmount this paradox by following a five-step model in which they make a claim, make the opposite claim, and then determine how well both claims are supported by the available evidence. This process can enable practicing educators to make more valid decisions based on data.

        <title>Kappan call for manuscripts, 2023-24</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 70-71, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Kappan’s new publishing year starts in September. We’re looking for research into long-term trends showing improvement or consistent promise, pieces on how schools are evolving to better meet the needs of students and families, and stories of programs that effectively address problems in schools and communities.
