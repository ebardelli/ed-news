        <title>Early Birds in Elementary School? School Start Times and Outcomes for Younger Students</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While research supports later start times for secondary schools, there is little evidence regarding start times for elementary schools. We address this gap with a statewide examination of elementary schools and a quasi-experimental analysis of an urban district that recently changed its elementary start times. We find that earlier start times predict less sleep for students. Regarding academic outcomes, our estimates are small in magnitude and suggest that earlier elementary start times have near-zero effects. Earlier start times predict a slight increase in absences and modestly higher math scores, especially for traditionally disadvantaged students. In districts that need to stagger start times, it may be advisable for elementary schools to start earlier to accommodate later secondary school start times.

        <title>Fiscal Federalism and K–12 Education Funding: Policy Lessons from Two Educational Crises</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We synthesize and critique federal fiscal policy during the Great Recession and COVID-19 pandemic. First, the amount of aid during both crises was inadequate to meet policy goals. Second, the mechanisms used to distribute funds were disconnected from policy goals and provided different levels of aid to districts with equivalent levels of economic disadvantage. Third, data tools are missing, making it difficult to understand whether funds were used to meet policy goals. Details for these results are provided along with policy recommendations.

        <title>Preference Compromise and Parent Satisfaction With Schools in Choice Markets: Evidence From Kansas City, Missouri</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Parents desire several features when choosing a school, but they often compromise on some preferences in favor of others. We develop a novel measure of aggregate preference compromise by examining the discrepancy between ideal preferences and those specified under real-world constraints. Relying on data from a representative sample in Kansas City, MO, we find that low-income and less educated parents and those from historically marginalized racial/ethnic backgrounds make a greater degree of preference compromise than other parents do. This is associated with lower satisfaction with chosen schools, suggesting that compromises matter. Less privileged families are also geographically more restricted in making school choices and have more limited access to better performing schools, which can aggravate preference compromises. Implications are discussed.

        <title>Mathematical modelling of exponential growth as a rich learning environment for mathematics classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematical concepts are regularly used in media reports concerning the Covid-19 pandemic. These include growth models, which attempt to explain or predict the effectiveness of interventions and developments, as well as the reproductive factor. Our contribution has the aim of showing that basic mental models about exponential growth are important for understanding media reports of Covid-19. Furthermore, we highlight how the coronavirus pandemic can be used as a context in mathematics classrooms to help students understand that they can and should question media reports on their own, using their mathematical knowledge. Therefore, we first present the role of mathematical modelling in achieving these goals in general. The same relevance applies to the necessary basic mental models of exponential growth. Following this description, based on three topics, namely, investigating the type of growth, questioning given course models, and determining exponential factors at different times, we show how the presented theoretical aspects manifest themselves in teaching examples when students are given the task of reflecting critically on existing media reports. Finally, the value of the three topics regarding the intended goals is discussed and conclusions concerning the possibilities and limits of their use in schools are drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning-Mode Choice, Student Engagement, and Achievement Growth During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unanticipated, near-universal shift from in-person to virtual instruction in the spring of 2020. During the 2020–21 school year, schools began to reopen, and families were faced with decisions regarding the instructional mode for their children. We leverage administrative, survey, and virtual-learning data to examine the determinants of family learning-mode choice and associations between virtual education, student engagement, and academic achievement. Family preference for virtual (versus face-to-face) instruction was highly associated with subsequent school-level infection rates and appeared relatively uniform within schools. We find that students assigned to a higher proportion of instructional days in virtual mode experienced higher rates of attendance but negative achievement growth compared to students who were assigned a higher proportion of instructional days in face-to-face mode. Insights from this study can be used to better understand family preferences as well as to target and refine virtual learning in a post-COVID-19 society.

        <title>Teaching–Learning Contemporary Physics: from Research to Practice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As part of Springer, the edited book addresses innovative approaches and pedagogical strategies, the development of effective methods for assessing, and the innovative project in teaching and learning contemporary physics. This volume includes successful experimental and theoretical studies of QM teaching, which the experts or teachers can then adopt or modify the concept into practice in context. The 19 chapters, representing results of original study works dealing with Physics Education, are selected from the contributions in a conference on the teaching and learning of quantum physics. The goal of the book is to introduce contemporary physics to all level schools. Without a doubt, the book is recommended for high school teachers, instructional developers, and scientists to explore and develop the theories, approaches, and strategies in the book to advance teaching/learning of CP.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panel unit-root tests with structural breaks</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 664-678, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we introduce a new community-contributed command called xtbunitroot, which implements the panel-data unit-root tests developed by Karavias and Tzavalis (2014, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis 76: 391–407). These tests allow for one or two structural breaks in deterministic components of the series and can be seen as panel-data counterparts of the tests by Zivot and Andrews (1992, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10: 251–270) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997, Review of Economics and Statistics 79: 212–218). The dates of the breaks can be known or unknown. The tests allow for intercepts and linear trends, nonnormal errors, and cross-section heteroskedasticity and dependence. They have power against homogeneous and heterogeneous alternatives and can be applied to panels with small or large time-series dimensions.

        <title>xtusreg: Software for dynamic panel regression under irregular time spacing</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 713-724, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;We introduce a new command, xtusreg, that estimates parameters of fixed-effects dynamic panel regression models under unequal time spacing. After reviewing the method, we examine the finite-sample performance of the command using simulated data. We also illustrate the command with the National Longitudinal Survey Original Cohorts: Older Men, whose personal interviews took place in the unequally spaced years of 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1981, and 1990. The methods underlying xtusreg are those discussed by Sasaki and Xin (2017, Journal of Econometrics 196: 320–330).

        <title>ivcrc: An instrumental-variables estimator for the correlated random-coefficients model</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 469-495, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;We discuss the ivcrc command, which implements an instrumental-variables (IV) estimator for the linear correlated random-coefficients model. The correlated random-coefficients model is a natural generalization of the standard linear IV model that allows for endogenous, multivalued treatments and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. The estimator implemented by ivcrc uses recent semiparametric identification results that allow for flexible functional forms and permit instruments that may be binary, discrete, or continuous. The ivcrc command also allows for the estimation of varying-coefficient regressions, which are closely related in structure to the proposed IV estimator. We illustrate the use of ivcrc by estimating the returns to education in the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men.

The sgpv command and its companions allow the easy calculation of SGPVs and their associated diagnostics, as well as the plotting of SGPVs against the standard p-values.

        <title>Bunching estimation of elasticities using Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 597-624, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Typical censoring models have mass points at the upper or lower tails, or at both tails, of an otherwise continuous outcome distribution. In contrast, we consider a censoring model with a mass point in the interior of the outcome distribution. We refer to this mass point as “bunching” and use it to estimate model parameters. For example, economic theory suggests that, for increasing marginal income tax rates, many taxpayers will report income exactly at the threshold where the tax rate increases. This translates into a censoring model with bunching at the threshold. The size of this mass point of taxpayers can be used to estimate an elasticity parameter that summarizes taxpayers’ responses to taxes. In this article, we introduce the command bunching, which implements new nonparametric and semiparametric identification methods for estimating elasticities developed by Bertanha, McCallum, and Seegert (2021, Technical Report 2021-002, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). These methods rely on weaker assumptions than what are currently made in the literature and result in meaningfully different estimates of the elasticity.

        <title>Flexible parametric survival analysis with multiple timescales: Estimation and implementation using stmt</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 679-701, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we describe methodology that allows for multiple timescales using flexible parametric survival models without the need for time splitting. When one fits flexible parametric survival models on the log-hazard scale, numerical integration is required in the log likelihood to fit the model. The use of numerical integration allows incorporation of arbitrary functions of time into the model and hence lends itself to the inclusion of multiple timescales in an appealing way. We describe and exemplify these methods and show how to use the command stmt , which implements these methods, alongside its postestimation commands.

            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/22/3&quot;&gt;Volume 22, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 702-712, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, I show how to calculate consistent marginal effects on the original scale of the outcome variable in Stata after estimating a linear regression with a dependent variable that has been transformed by the inverse hyperbolic sine function. The method uses a nonparametric retransformation of the error term and accounts for any scaling of the dependent variable. The inverse hyperbolic sine function is not invariant to scaling, which is known to shift marginal effects between those from an untransformed dependent variable to those of a logtransformed dependent variable, when all observations are positive.
