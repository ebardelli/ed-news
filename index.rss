        <title>The role of teacher identity in teacher self-efficacy development: the case of Katie</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article illustrates the role of teacher identity in teacher self-efficacy development during initial teacher education. It has been posited that teacher self-efficacy develops on the basis of information accessed through four self-efficacy sources: vicarious and enactive experiences, social persuasion, and physiological and affective states, and by interacting with a myriad of personal and external factors. The very process of teacher self-efficacy development, however, is not well understood. This phenomenological longitudinal qualitative case study contributes to addressing this issue by illustrating how a pre-service secondary mathematics teacher’s teacher self-efficacy is affected by the way she sees herself. More specifically, the study illustrates how aspects of a strong student teacher identity negatively affect the pre-service teacher’s teacher self-efficacy appraisal, and how her teacher identity, emerging through the processes of autonomous role enactment and social verification, supports teacher self-efficacy development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preservice mathematics teachers’ conceptions of mathematically rich and contextually realistic problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigated the middle school preservice mathematics teachers’ conceptualization of what it means for a problem to be mathematically rich and contextually realistic and how their conceptions evolved during a series of professional development activities. Fifteen middle school preservice mathematics teachers were involved in this design-based research. The professional development activities were designed based on L. Shulman and J. Shulman’s (Shulman and Shulman, Journal of Curriculum Studies 36:257–271, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r54&quot;&gt;2004&lt;/span&gt;) reflective and communal clusters with psychological roots in Schön’s notion of “reflective practitioners” and Vygotsky’s social development theory. These professional development activities were integrated into the methods and field experience courses of the teacher education program. The audio records of the whole group and small group discussions and all written products (i.e., problems, criteria list, and reflection memos) were analyzed to understand preservice teachers’ conceptions. This study revealed that the professional development activities helped preservice teachers produce the problems that would be interesting and encouraging for students to develop their own solution methods. Preservice teachers’ conceptions also evolved in a collective and reflective community. In this respect, this study presented &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; way to design professional development for teachers that nurtures their understanding of the components supporting mathematical richness and contextual meaningfulness of a problem. Hence, this study provided implications for teacher education practices and future research on mathematics teacher preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modelling lessons for more than imitation: investigating teachers’ reactions and decompositions of unfamiliar practices</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The literature highlights differing views on the efficacy of modelling lessons for teacher professional learning. In this study we draw on dissonance theory to discuss lesson modelling that seeks to transcend ‘do as I do’ imitation and provoke teachers’ attention to intended teaching practices: a necessary pre-cursor for changes to practice. A collective case study investigated the experiences and perceptions of 18 practising primary teachers from four school contexts participating in the process of: collectively observing modelling of mathematics lessons in their classrooms, analysing different parts of those practices with the modeller, and enacting them. It was found that modelling lessons associated with inquiry-oriented approaches for developing students’ problem-solving and reasoning in teachers’ own classrooms appeared to confront their assumptions about traditional approaches to teaching and learning mathematics. The teachers’ surprise at their students’ engagement in the challenging learning experiences conflicted with their existing views of teaching and impelled them to reflect on and set goals for improving their practice. Suggestions for pre- and post-lesson protocols for stimulating productive discussions are proposed, along with implications for designing school-based professional learning processes using lesson modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Contradictions and their manifestations in professional learning communities in mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Professional learning communities (PLC) have increasingly attracted attention in research on teachers’ professional development. The aim of this study is to identify contradictions that can occur and be manifested in PLCs in mathematics. Identifying contradictions in PLCs are important, as the identification and resolution of contradictions are crucial to developing PLCs. We have conceptualized PLCs and contradictions within the Cultural Historical Activity Theory. Our data consist of two iterations of interviews with four teacher leader coaches with extensive experience of coaching teacher leaders of PLCs in mathematics. The study distinguishes 26 manifestations of contradictions, taking the overall forms of dilemmas and conflicts. Our results can be used in designing PLCs in mathematics: they can be used to make visible and increase participants’ awareness of contradictions involved in PLCs and thereby increase the possibility that the contradictions serve as sources of support rather than obstacles in the development of PLCs in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Productive ambiguity in unconventional representations: “what the fraction is going on?”</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We explore the responses of 26 prospective elementary-school teachers to the claim “1/6.5 is not a fraction” asserted by a hypothetical classroom student. The data comprise scripted dialogues that depict how the participants envisioned a classroom discussion of this claim to evolve, as well as an accompanying commentary where they described their personal understanding of the notion of a fraction. The analysis is presented from the perspective of productive ambiguity, where different types of ambiguity highlight the prospective teachers’ mathematical interpretations and pedagogical choices. In particular, we focus on the ambiguity inherent in the aforementioned unconventional representation and how the teachers reconciled it by invoking various models and interpretations of a fraction. We conclude with a description of how the perspective of productive ambiguity can enrich teacher education and classroom discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers’ Conceptions of Fairness in Classroom Assessment: An Empirical Study</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;With heightened equity pursuits in 21st century schools and the key role of assessment in teachers’ concerns with educational equity, scholars have recently attempted to empirically investigate teachers’ conceptions of fairness in classroom assessment. This study contributes to this growing literature and draws on interview data from 27 experienced high school teachers to further appreciate the factors that propel teachers’ fairness conceptions. The results indicate that the teachers’ conceptions of fairness in classroom assessment were influenced by three themes: (a) individual mechanisms, (b) social mechanisms, and (c) dialectical relationships between individual and social mechanisms. These themes underscored how teachers’ individual philosophies and experiences interacted with their encounters with social conditions of society, schools, and classrooms to influence their conceptions and articulated practices of fairness in classroom assessments. The results contribute to provoke conversations around assessment fairness education during pre- and in-service programs.

        <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Learning Systems</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The adaptive learning problem concerns how to create an individualized learning plan (also referred to as a learning policy) that chooses the most appropriate learning materials based on a learner’s latent traits. In this article, we study an important yet less-addressed adaptive learning problem—one that assumes continuous latent traits. Specifically, we formulate the adaptive learning problem as a Markov decision process. We assume latent traits to be continuous with an unknown transition model and apply a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm—the deep Q-learning algorithm—that can effectively find the optimal learning policy from data on learners’ learning process without knowing the actual transition model of the learners’ continuous latent traits. To efficiently utilize available data, we also develop a transition model estimator that emulates the learner’s learning process using neural networks. The transition model estimator can be used in the deep Q-learning algorithm so that it can more efficiently discover the optimal learning policy for a learner. Numerical simulation studies verify that the proposed algorithm is very efficient in finding a good learning policy. Especially with the aid of a transition model estimator, it can find the optimal learning policy after training using a small number of learners.

        <title>A Meta-Analysis on the Differences in Mathematical and Cognitive Skills Between Individuals With and Without Mathematical Learning Disabilities</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Types of mathematical learning disability (MLD) are very heterogeneous. Lower scores on mathematics and several cognitive skills have been revealed in samples with MLD compared with those with typical development (TD), but these studies vary in sample selection, making it difficult to generalize conclusions. Furthermore, many studies have investigated only one or few cognitive skills, making it difficult to compare their relative discrepancies. The current meta-analysis (k = 145) was conducted to (a) give a state-of-the-art overview of the mathematical and cognitive skills associated with MLD and (b) investigate how selection criteria influence conclusions regarding this topic. Results indicated that people with MLD display lower scores not only on mathematics but also on number sense, working memory, and rapid automatized naming compared with those with TD, in general independently of the criteria used to define MLD. A profile that distinguishes people with more serious, persistent, or specific MLD from those with less severe MLD was not detected.

        <title>Impact of a sequence on the history of ancient mathematics informed by student experiences and teacher practices</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study we examined the impact of four teaching sessions on the history of ancient Mesopotamian mathematics, in a 10th -grade classroom. The sessions were taught primarily with historical objectives by researchers in the history of ancient mathematics. We reconstructed historians’ practices and ethos. The presence of the researchers provided the opportunity to study a sequence in which history was taught ‘as a goal’. Moreover, there was no intermediary between the historians and the teaching given to the students, which allowed us to study directly the transposition choices that interested the researchers. We cross-referenced the qualitative and quantitative results of some of the previous findings with the researchers’ task design and discourse. We focused on two aspects, namely, students’ relationship to mathematics as a scientific activity, and the effects of the students’ encounters with the tools and ethics of the history researcher. We found evidence suggesting that students may have made progress in their perception of mathematics ‘as an activity’ and that a certain ‘dépaysement’ emerged. Further, the emergence of debates on the nature of historical sources suggests that the teaching of history ‘as an endeavor’ also seemed to have affected the students. We conclude by proposing some methodological guidelines for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Comprehension of argumentation in mathematical text: what is the role of interest?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article describes the research design and findings from a use-inspired study of online text-based mathematics resources. We sought to understand whether and how existing mathematics interest, together with the learner characteristics of prior coursework in mathematics and proof scheme, influenced comprehension of mathematical argumentation and triggered interest in two types of mathematics text: (1) text featuring concrete, real-world applications (public domain) and (2) text with abstract and generalized modes of expression and content (abstract domain). Using an online assessment and person-centered analyses, we studied 64 (32 M, 32 F) undergraduate students who were and were not pursuing advanced mathematics coursework. Cluster analysis revealed two participant groups. Less mathematically immersed (LMI) participants improved comprehension of mathematical argumentation when working with public domain text, performing comparably to the more mathematically immersed (MMI) cluster in this domain; those in the MMI cluster performed comparably across text domains. In addition, LMI participants were more likely to identify public domain text as more interesting than abstract text, and they also were more likely than those in the MMI group to explain this by citing public rather than abstract domain reasons. Taken together, study findings suggest that interest in coordination with other learner characteristics scaffolds comprehension of mathematical argumentation. This study makes contributions to interest theory, understanding the role of interest in comprehension of mathematical argumentation, and ways in which practitioners might leverage student interest to promote comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using vignettes to investigate mathematics teachers’ beliefs for promoting cognitive engagement in secondary mathematics classroom practice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Promoting engagement is crucial for encouraging student participation, interest, and learning in mathematics. Student engagement has been conceptualized as interrelated types comprising behavioural, emotional, and cognitive characteristics. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognitive engagement&lt;/em&gt;, our focus in this paper, relates to students’ psychological investment in learning and practices used to enhance learning, such as self-regulatory strategies and metacognitive processes. Although crucial for students’ learning, research suggests that teachers’ practices for promoting students’ cognitive engagement are not well understood. In this qualitative study, we investigated the beliefs of 40 secondary mathematics teachers across eight English schools concerning promoting cognitive engagement in mathematics classrooms, and whether teachers with different cognitive engagement beliefs differ in the features of classroom practice they attend to in relation to promoting student self-regulation and metacognition. We developed a Cognitive Engagement Framework (CEF) for the following purposes: (1) to develop vignettes that described the practices of two contrasting teachers (Teacher A and Teacher B), who differed in their use of specific self-regulation and metacognitive processes; and (2) to use as a tool for analysis. 17 participants identified with Teacher A who favoured a controlling style towards student strategy use such as activating knowledge, planning, and enacting and regulating strategies, and a passive approach towards students’ use of self-reflection. 14 participants identified with Teacher B who favoured promoting student autonomy for planning and enacting and regulating strategies, self-reflection, and acknowledged affective elements. In addition to its findings, the paper makes a methodological contribution by using ‘vignettes’ as a new way of investigating teachers’ beliefs, and a theoretical contribution through the development of the CEF.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons Learned About Incorporating High-Leverage Teaching Practices in the Undergraduate Proof Classroom to Promote Authentic and Equitable Participation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In recent years, professional organizations in the United States have suggested undergraduate mathematics shift away from pure lecture format. Transitioning to a student-centered class is a complex instructional undertaking especially in the proof-based context. In this paper, we share lessons learned from a design-based research project centering instructional elements as objects of design. We focus on how three high leverage teaching practices (HLTP; established in the K-12 literature) can be adapted to the proof context to promote student engagement in authentic proof activity with attention to issues of access and equity of participation. In general, we found that HLTPs translated well to the proof setting, but required increased attention to navigating between formal and informal mathematics, developing precision around mathematical objects, supporting competencies beyond formal proof construction, and structuring group work. We position this paper as complementary to existing research on instructional innovation by focusing not on task trajectories, but on concrete teaching practices that can support successful adaption of student-centered approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Emerging Interplay Between Subjective and Objective Notions of Probability in Young Children</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To promote the development of young children’s probabilistic intuitions through experience, we focus on the dual nature of probability related to both belief (subjective notion) and frequency (objective notion). This paper reports on the responses of 7–8-year-olds on two tasks used to bridge subjective and objective notions of probability. We explore how these two conceptions interact in children’s estimations of the likelihood of outcomes from chance events as new information is obtained from data collected through physical experiments and computer simulations. Our findings suggest that even though children have not yet reached the desired level of quantitative reasoning, several used the data in a reasonable way to update their subjective probabilities based on their personal beliefs. These findings highlight the nascent potential of children to reason about probability when presented with a sequence of activities. These activities are used to support them to state their subjective probability estimations, using a contextually rich continuum, while at the same time recalibrate their estimations to more accurately reflect the theoretical probability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Supporting Young Children With Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From Caregivers in Virginia</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Early care and education (ECE) experiences shape children’s developmental trajectories, particularly for children who have or may have disabilities. However, caregivers of children with disabilities have faced considerable challenges finding care for their children, which have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using survey data from nearly 3,000 caregivers of preschool-age children in Virginia collected in December 2020 and January 2021, we find that caregivers of children with disabilities were less likely to find ECE programs that met their needs, more likely to experience high levels of stress, and more likely to be concerned about their children’s development than were caregivers of children without disabilities. Concerns about child development were particularly pronounced among caregivers of children with disabilities in remote instructional settings. Our findings suggest a disproportionate impact of ECE disruption on caregivers of children with disabilities and the need for targeted supports for these caregivers moving forward.

        <title>Principal Leadership for School-Wide Transformation of Elementary Mathematics Teaching: Why the Principal’s Conception of Teacher Learning Matters</title>

            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Supporting teacher learning for normative change in classroom learning environments creates significant demands on principal leadership. We offer an analytic framework that aims to understand principal practice for instructional transformation. The framework examines how the principal’s conception of teacher learning shapes practice in relation to particular contexts and support systems. We illustrate the explanatory power of this framework by using it to make sense of one elementary principal’s practice in leading her school for instructional transformation in mathematics. Our analysis contributes to how leadership efforts to transform instruction might be studied and ultimately supported.

        <title>The Politics of Progressivity: Court-Ordered Reforms, Racial Difference, and School Finance Fairness</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article contributes to our understanding of American education politics by exploring when and why states redistribute K–12 education dollars to poorer schools. It does so by examining three explanations for intrastate changes in progressivity: court-ordered finance reforms, political trends, and demographic changes. Using state-level data from 1995 to 2016, we find mixed evidence that progressivity increased following a court-ordered school-finance overhaul. Rather, we show that changes in progressivity were most consistently tied to changes in student demography: As students became poorer, or more racially diverse, lawmakers created less progressive finance systems. The article concludes by discussing what these findings mean for advocates seeking to protect and advance gains in education-spending progressivity.

        <title>Opportunity Structures for Student Activism, Diversity, and Institutional Change</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;College students across the United States are engaging in protests, sit-ins, and walk-outs, but when do these political acts result in tangible institutional policy changes? This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews and focus groups with 502 participants across the United States to examine when and why college student political behaviors influence institutional changes on college campuses. Findings from this study suggest that higher education institutions present different political opportunity structures for students to engage in activism. These political opportunity structures provide policy windows at the institutional level to affect campus wide change. To the extent that these changes promote diversity, equity, and inclusion though also depends on these varying structures. In this paper, a typology of these structures is presented to explain when student activism shapes institutional change and for whom.

        <title>Police Stops and School Engagement: Examining Cultural Socialization From Parents and Schools as Protective Factors Among African American Adolescents</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Police stops often perpetuate racial disparities in academic outcomes, yet few studies have examined factors that mitigate these negative consequences. Using two longitudinal studies (Study 1: n = 483, M-age = 12.88, 53% males; Study 2: n = 131, M-age = 15.11, 34% males), this article tests whether parental and school cultural socialization reduced the negative associations between police stops and youth’s school engagement. Results showed that youth with police encounters reported lower school engagement. Parental cultural socialization conferred protection in one study, while school cultural socialization was a protective factor in both studies. The implications of this work stand to benefit those working to reduce the negative links between policing and African American youth’s school engagement.

        <title>Assessing the Effect of Project-Based Learning on Science Learning in Elementary Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This investigation studied the effects of the Multiple Literacies in Project-Based Learning science intervention on third graders’ academic, social, and emotional learning. This intervention includes four science units and materials, professional learning, and post-unit assessments; features of project-based learning; three-dimensional learning (National Research Council, 2012); and the performance expectations from the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). The intervention was evaluated with a cluster randomized control trial in 46 Michigan schools with 2,371 students. Results show that students who received the intervention had higher scores on a standardized science test (0.277 standard deviation) and reported higher levels of self-reflection and collaboration when involved in science activities.
