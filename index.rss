        <title>A framework for analysing the relationships between peer interactions and learners’ mathematical identities: accounting for personal and social identities</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The absence of discussions of identity that consider both subjective/personal and social aspects of identity is an important concern in mathematics education research. This paper proposes a framework to analyse the mathematical identities offered to and constructed by learners during peer interactions, by considering personal and social identities. To exemplify the framework, we discuss how two pairs of secondary school learners, who were engaged with similarly by their teachers and who performed similarly academically, interacted with each other and offered and constructed micro-identities during moments of a lesson, and macro-identities across lessons. We show that when learners were offered identities by a peer as higher, lower or equal status, they constructed their identities by affiliating with or resisting the identities offered by their peer. Their interactions and the identities that they constructed were informed by their personal identities, including their emotions when learning mathematics, and their social identities, including their choices to occupy certain roles in the classroom community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rethinking Dispositions in Teaching and Teacher Education: Virtue and the Manners of Democracy as a Way of Life</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As long as there have been teachers, there has been an expectation that they be of good character and model virtue. The author describes developments in the thought about teacher dispositions and identifies specific shortcomings in the effort to define and assess them as part of teacher education program accreditation. Virtue ethics as an alternative conceptual possibility is considered but found wanting. Seeking to identify a moral framework capable of supporting education, including teacher education program development, he suggests focus on the “manners” of democracy that arise from an analysis of democracy as a distinctive way of life, an essential social and civic practice. Five manners are suggested: hospitality, attuned listening, voice, reflectivity, and evidential discernment. Each manner is briefly described and discussed.

        <title>State Education Agency Governance, Virtual Learning, and Student Privacy: Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic altered public education as schools closed across the United States. Eighty percent of teachers reported interacting with students online, often utilizing free technology like Zoom and Google Workspace for Education. This article provides a comprehensive overview of state education agencies’ recommendations for emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 school closures in early 2020. Reviewing 337 publicly available documents from 50 state education agencies reveals a fragmented response: state education agencies relied on nongovernmental organizations to do the work of governance.

        <title>High School Students’ Expectations and College Aspirations: Causes and Consequences</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on the disparities between the educational aspirations and expectations of high school students in the U.S., and explores why students do not expect to earn a bachelor’s degree despite their aspirations. Using a national dataset and logistic/multinomial logistic regression analyses, the study identified the factors associated with this diminished expectation, such as family background, school experiences, and college preparedness activities. Additionally, students with low expectations of reaching their college aspirations are less likely to search for, apply to, and/or enroll in 4-year colleges. This study provides new insights into the college access process.

        <title>Online Credit Recovery as an Intervention for High School Students Who Fail Courses</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Online credit recovery (OCR) refers to online courses that high school students take after previously failing the course. Many have suggested that OCR courses are helping students to graduate from high school without corresponding increases in academic skills. This study analyzes administrative data from the state of North Carolina to evaluate the efficacy of OCR using full data from public and private OCR providers. Findings indicate that students who fail courses and enroll in OCR are 20 percentage points more likely to earn course credit, have lower test scores of up to two tenths of a standard deviation, and are about eight percentage points more likely to graduate high school within 4 years than students who repeat courses traditionally. Test score differences are particularly large for Biology compared to Math I and English II. Hispanic and economically disadvantaged OCR students are more likely to graduate high school than their peers.

        <title>Handling Missing Data in Cross-Classified Multilevel Analyses: An Evaluation of Different Multiple Imputation Approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular method for handling missing data. In education research, it can be challenging to use MI because the data often have a clustered structure that need to be accommodated during MI. Although much research has considered applications of MI in hierarchical data, little is known about its use in cross-classified data, in which observations are clustered in multiple higher-level units simultaneously (e.g., schools and neighborhoods, transitions from primary to secondary schools). In this article, we consider several approaches to MI for cross-classified data (CC-MI), including a novel fully conditional specification approach, a joint modeling approach, and other approaches that are based on single- and two-level MI. In this context, we clarify the conditions that CC-MI methods need to fulfill to provide a suitable treatment of missing data, and we compare the approaches both from a theoretical perspective and in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate the use of CC-MI in real data and discuss the implications of our findings for research practice.

        <title>The Long-Term Solvency of Teacher Pension Plans: How We Got to Now and Prospects for Recovery</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 98-115, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The COVID-related financial market decline and economic recession have raised new concerns regarding the financial sustainability of retirement plans for state and local government employees, the largest group of whom is public school teachers. Using data from the Public Plans Database and the National Income and Product Accounts, I analyze teacher pension plans over the 2001–2019 period, seeking to answer questions regarding teacher pensions’ funded status, investment decisions and returns, adequacy of contributions, and generosity of benefits. These data show that teacher pension funding peaked at the beginning of the 2001–2019 period due to the tech bubble’s inflation of asset values, but then it declined thereafter due to investment returns that significantly underperformed assumptions, failures by sponsoring governments to consistently make full contributions, and increases in the generosity of pension benefits. School districts will face substantial funding challenges in the post-COVID period, as investment losses are factored into contribution rates, government revenues available to make contributions shrink, and education funding from state governments comes under pressure. I outline several policy alternatives that policymakers may consider, but none would make restoring teacher pensions to full funding a painless process.

        <title>Teacher Pension Reform Must Be About Cost and Design</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 116-118, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This commentary discusses how the teacher pension debate is often predicated on the idea of generous benefits for teachers and whether those are deserved, when in practice most teachers are disadvantaged by a retirement system with long vesting periods and limited portability.

        <title>How Much Do Teachers Value Compensation Deferred for Retirement? Evidence From Defined Contribution Rate Choices</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 80-90, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;How much do teachers value compensation deferred for retirement (CDR)? This question is important because the vast majority of public school teachers are covered by defined benefit pension plans that “backload” a large share of compensation to retirement relative to the compensation structure in the private sector, and there is scant evidence about whether pension structures are consistent with teacher preferences for current compensation versus CDR. This study examines a unique setting in Washington State, where teachers are enrolled in a hybrid pension system that has both defined benefit and defined contribution components. We exploit the fact that teachers have choices over their defined contribution rate to infer their revealed preferences for current versus CDR. We find that teachers on average contribute 7.23% of salary income toward retirement; 62% in fact elect to contribute more than the minimally required contribution of 5%. This suggests that teachers value CDR far more than suggested by prior evidence.

        <title>A Structural Econometric Approach to Analyzing the Impact of Teacher Pension Reform</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 63-70, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The growing fiscal cost of K–12 teacher pension plans and pension-induced labor market distortions have led to calls for teacher pension reforms. Dynamic structural econometric models are a useful way to analyze the fiscal and staffing consequences of current and alternative retirement plans. This article lays out the benefits of the structural econometric modeling approach for analyzing changes to teacher pension plans and estimates such a model for Missouri public school teachers. The results are then used to simulate effects of a pension reform on teacher retirement and employer pension costs.

        <title>Incentivizing Retirement: An Analysis of Cash Retirement Incentives for Chicago Teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 71-79, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Retirement incentives are frequently used by school districts facing financial difficulties. They provide a means of either decreasing staff size or replacing retiring senior teachers with less expensive junior teachers. We analyze a one-time retirement incentive in a large school district paid to teachers willing to retire at the end of the 2016–2017 school year that required 1,500 teachers to accept the offer for it to be paid. The analysis uses an estimated structural model of teacher retention—enabling predictions through simulation of what teacher behavior would be in lieu of the incentive. As predicted by the model, too few teachers accepted the incentive and it was not paid. Simulations enable the decomposition of the would-be retirement incentive takers into those that retired because of the retirement incentive (i.e., marginal teachers) and those who would have retired without the incentive. We find that (1) most teachers who receive the retirement incentive would have retired regardless leading to substantial payments to teachers whose decisions are unchanged, (2) marginal teachers are likely to have retired within a couple years without the incentive limiting the period in which a salary gap can recoup the incentive’s costs, and (3) sharp increases in salary over the first years of teaching narrow the salary gap from which potential savings might derive. These mechanisms are common to most school districts so it is unlikely districts using retirement incentives will realize any cost savings if they replace retiring teachers with junior teachers.

        <title>Commentary on Teacher Pension Papers</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 119-122, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This commentary explains how changing labor market conditions have made it more important for schools to attract and retain skilled teachers and yet more difficult to do so. This is important context for considering the contributions of the five papers on teacher pensions in this special issue. I describe and comment on the evidence that defined benefit (DB) pension plans have deleterious impacts on the ability of public schools to provide students with an excellent education. I describe the merits of alternative strategies for responding to the central problem with DB plans as currently funded. I conclude by explaining the importance of considering the design of teacher pension plans as part of a multipronged strategy to provide all students with a high-quality education.

        <title>Teacher Pensions: An Overview</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 57-62, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This article provides an overview for the special issue and a framework for thinking about the included papers. We begin by explaining why teacher pensions is a topic that should be of interest to the broader education research community and not just specialists in school finance or teacher compensation. Pension costs now account for 11% of K–12 operating expenditures—a share that has been steadily rising. The question for the education research community is whether these expenditures represent the best way to recruit, retain, and motivate high-quality teachers. We briefly review the current pension landscape with an explanation of how these plans work, trends in costs and expenditures, and changes that have been discussed or implemented. We then provide a brief literature review. Finally, we discuss how the articles in this special issue contribute to the literature on such topics as the influence of teacher pension policies on school staffing and workforce quality, teacher preferences for retirement plans, and the sustainability of plans.

        <title>The Three R’s of Teacher Pension Funding: Redistribution, Return, and Risk</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/edra/52/2&quot;&gt;Volume 52, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 91-97, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;How are teacher pension benefits funded? Under traditional plans, the full cost of career teachers’ benefits far exceeds the contributions designated for them. The gap between the two has three pieces, which may (with some license) be mnemonically tagged the three R’s of pension funding: redistribution, return, and risk. First, some contributions made for the benefits of short-term teachers are redistributed to fund the benefits of career teachers. Second, pension plans assume rosy returns on their investments, which push costs onto future teachers and taxpayers. Finally, the risk inherent in providing guaranteed pensions carries other costs, tangible and intangible, notably including the nontrivial risk of insolvency, which would dramatically raise mandated contributions and endanger future teacher benefits. I quantify these three components of the gap between benefits and contributions using the same metric as annual contributions. Illustrating with the California plan, I find the full cost of a career teacher’s annual accumulation of benefits can be as high as 46.6% of earnings, nearly triple the corresponding contributions of 17.5%. To understand this gap, which fiscally affects all areas of education policy, researchers and practitioners may find it helpful to think of the three R’s of pension funding: redistribution, return, and risk.

        <title>Anxiety in the mathematics classroom: reciprocal relations with control and value, and relations with subsequent achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students’ attitudes can be influential in the emotions experienced in mathematics learning and achievement at school. Two important judgements, according to Control-Value Theory are degree of control a student has over, and the value attached to, learning activities or outcomes. Appraisals of control and value are believed to play a central role in the emotions experienced when learning, and subsequent achievement. Achievement, in turn, can strengthen or weaken control-value appraisals. In the present study we set out to examine the bidirectional relations between control-value appraisals and a key emotion experienced in the mathematics classroom, namely anxiety. In addition, we tested the proposition that control-value appraisals are indirectly linked to achievement, mediated by classroom-related anxiety. The participants were 1242 Year 5 students (49% female), with a mean of 9.3 years, from 24 English primary schools. Self-report data for anxiety, and control-value appraisals, were collected over two waves (separated by seven months) and mathematics achievement collected from a classroom test one week later. Results from a structural equation model showed bidirectional relations between higher anxiety and lower control. Although anxiety predicted lower value, value was unrelated to subsequent anxiety. Higher control at the first wave of measurement was related to higher mathematics achievement, mediated by lower anxiety, at the second wave. These results underscore the importance of reducing anxiety when learning mathematics and suggest that intervention could achieve this outcome by reducing anxiety directly or by strengthening control.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Student values and wellbeing in mathematics education: perspectives of Chinese primary students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Around the world the prevalence of mathematics anxiety and disengagement point to a poor sense of student ‘mathematical wellbeing’. Mathematical wellbeing is defined here as the fulfilment of one’s ultimate or core values, accompanied by positive feelings and functioning in mathematics education. Yet student wellbeing and how to support it in specific school subjects including mathematics is vastly under-researched. Also, despite outperforming other countries in international mathematics assessments, East Asian students generally appear to experience poor affect and high academic burden in mathematics education, which are indicative of poor mathematical wellbeing. In this context, this explorative and descriptive study investigates the values that are associated with the mathematical wellbeing of a cohort of Chinese primary school students. 258 Grade three students in Chengdu, China responded to a questionnaire which explored teacher-nominated mathematics learning moments that students valued most for their mathematical wellbeing. Findings pointed to students valuing all the learning moments to some extent, with good grades, fun and interest, mathematics-themed videos, and teacher praise rated most commonly for wellbeing. The values underlying these learning moments are similar to the seven mathematical wellbeing dimensions found in Australian classrooms. The findings also highlight the cultural subjectivities involved, in which the same classroom actions can reflect different underlying values across cultures, and in which a particular value can be espoused in different ways in different places. We also look ahead to suggest how teachers might support students’ mathematical wellbeing, by recognising and then fulfilling their students’ values in the mathematics classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Motivational states in an undergraduate mathematics course: relations between facets of individual interest, task values, basic needs, and effort</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;According to situated expectancy-value models, motivational variables play an important role in students’ engagement in academic mathematics courses and achievement. However, for academic mathematical learning, only a few studies provide information regarding the fluctuation of task values on different occasions (situation-specificity, state) and the extent to which task values depend on individual characteristics (personal-specificity, trait). Thus, answering these questions provides information about the extent to which adequate situational characteristics, such as relevance interventions, can influence students’ motivation to engage in the learning process. To contribute to this discussion of the situation- and personal-specificity of task values, I surveyed 181 undergraduate students attending an advanced mathematics course. These students reported on their task values and effort three times in four different lessons during a course in linear algebra. I focused on the following three questions: (1) situation-specificity: to what extent do task values fluctuate between situations (and between persons)? (2) predictions of task values: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict task values? (3) predictions of effort: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict effort? These questions were answered by applying linear mixed models. The analysis results indicate that task values fluctuate only slightly in different situations and are strongly predicted by individual characteristics, such as interest in university mathematics, and task values predict effort. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I value the problem, but I don’t think my students will: preservice teachers’ judgments of task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;According to expectancy-value models, two important motivational constructs are task value and self-efficacy expectations. As students work intensively on mathematical problems in the classroom, teachers need the competence to judge whether students value solving the problem and how confident they are that they will succeed. However, not much is known about the mechanisms behind teachers’ judgments concerning students’ motivation. The goal of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (a) How do preservice teachers rate their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (b) Are there differences in preservice teachers’ diagnostic judgments concerning &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (c) Do preservice teachers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems differ from preservice teachers’ judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; task value and self-efficacy? A total of 182 preservice teachers were asked about the value of 12 problems, their confidence in solving the problems, and how hypothetical ninth graders would judge these constructs. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; perceptions regarding both constructs were lower for modelling problems than for other problems. When judging &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; motivation, ratings of both constructs were higher for word problems. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; motivation were significantly higher across all types of problems than their judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; perspectives. A positive correlation between preservice teachers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; motivation and their judgments of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;school students’&lt;/em&gt; motivation indicates the importance of teachers’ perceptions of their own motivation to solve mathematical problems for diagnostic judgments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marketing and School Choice: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School-choice programs may increase schools&#39; incentives for marketing rather than improving their educational offering. This article systematically reviews the literature on the marketing activities of primary and secondary schools worldwide. The 81 articles reviewed show that schools’ marketing has yet to be tackled by marketing academics or other social scientists outside the education field. Market-oriented U.S. charter schools and their international equivalents have stimulated recent research, but geographical gaps remain, particularly in countries with long-established school-choice policies and in rural areas. Schools deploy a range of marketing techniques with the intensity of activity directly correlated to the level of local competition and their position in the local hierarchy. Studies have analyzed schools’ use of market scanning, specific words and images in brochures, branding, segmentation, and targeting. These marketing activities are rarely accompanied by substantive curricular change, however, and may even contribute to social division through targeting or deceptive marketing activity.

        <title>Meal Vouchers Matter for Academic Attainment: A Community College Field Experiment</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Given growing awareness of the high prevalence of food insecurity among college students, higher education leaders are implementing various food interventions on their campuses. However, there is little research on the efficacy and impact of these initiatives. Using data from a field randomized control trial, we find that a relatively modest financial investment in campus meal cards coupled with proactive outreach by an existing campus office improved community college students’ academic attainment outcomes. Students who were invited to participate in the meal voucher program attempted and completed more credits during their first year of college and were more likely to graduate in 2 years than otherwise similar peers, indicating that a campus meal program can promote college success.

        <title>Disrupting Three Prominent Racialized Trauma Tropes</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School-based actors can uphold racialized systems and White supremacy through the racialized youth trauma narratives they reproduce. With respect to the growing movement to better support trauma-exposed youth inside school contexts, it is imperative that school-based actors avoid perpetuating deficit views of youth of color, who are disproportionately overexposed to traumatic experiences. Drawing on the youth trauma literature and personal experiences with educators, this essay outlines three common trauma tropes: (a) the hearing gunshots trope, (b) the socioeconomic myth trope, and (c) the what happened to them trope. These narratives are viewed as tropes because they function as rhetorical tools that ignite White-racialized ideological responses and perpetuate the racial status quo. In closing, the author shares four recommendations to better support trauma-exposed youth and provides empirical pathways for researchers to further study the race-trauma nexus.

        <title>Believing in Your Own Abilities: What Namibian High School Students Experiencing Mathematics Difficulties Can Teach Us</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we explore beliefs about teaching and learning held by 27 Namibian 11th graders (ages 16 to 18) experiencing difficulties in learning mathematics. Namibia’s education system and its people’s access to mathematics has suffered throughout years of colonization and apartheid. Namibia has made significant strides to create access and improve learning experiences. Its complex history provides a powerful context for exploring the beliefs and experiences of learners who persist despite experiencing difficulties. This research focuses specifically on learners experiencing mathematical difficulties, as the equity concerns of mathematics for these students are exacerbated through their experienced difficulties. While research on beliefs in mathematics education has been steadily growing, scant research has been conducted on the beliefs of learners experiencing persistent mathematics difficulties. Mathematics is recognized as a barrier to accessing higher education opportunities, and this research makes an important contribution to understanding the beliefs and resilience of Namibian learners experiencing mathematics difficulties. Understanding the beliefs and experiences of learners who continue to persist through their experienced difficulties can provide important insight into how to help and support all learners. The participants in this study shared their beliefs regarding experiences that would help them persist in their mathematics learning and their beliefs regarding systemic aspects of the Namibian schooling system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Deeper than Wordplay: A Systematic Review of Critical Quantitative Approaches in Education Research (2007–2021)</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although the critical research cannon is often associated with qualitative scholars, there is a growing number of critical scholars who are refusing positivist-informed quantitative analyses. However, as a growing number of education scholars engaged in critical approaches to quantitative inquiry, instances of conflation began to surface. We understood this conflation as the interchangeable use of the terms quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical quantitative throughout the literature and even within the same chapter or article. The purpose of our systematic literature review is twofold: (a) to understand how critical approaches to quantitative inquiry emerged as a new paradigm within quantitative methods and (b) whether there is any distinction between quantitative criticalism, QuantCrit, and critical quantitative inquiries or simply interchangeable wordplay. We share how critical quantitative approaches are definite shifts within the quantitative research paradigm, highlight relevant assumptions, and share strategies and future directions for applied practice in this emergent field.
