        <title>The CRT culture war in the suburbs</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-23, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; The suburbs are on the frontlines of a politicized culture war with critical race theory (CRT) at its center. States are passing legislation censoring teachers and administrators from using CRT in schools. This war threatens the intellectual freedom of educators and school leaders. The voices of the teachers, especially teachers of color, are largely absent. Antony Farag shares his experiences on the front lines and provides strategies for teachers and school leaders to navigate this war. He suggests that educators need to be a unifying force and that they must not be limited by censorship laws taking away their intellectual freedoms.

        <title>Bookshelf: Kappan authors on their favorite reads</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 69-69, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; In this regular column, Kappan authors recommend books that have inspired them as educators. This month, Mario Jackson recommends the 1970 classic Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Friere. And Rachel S. White recommends the 2014 young adult novel in poetry The Crossover by Kwame Alexander.

        <title>Loudest voices and unequal opportunities in the suburbs: A conversation with John B. Diamond</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-28, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Within racially diverse suburban high schools, an opportunity exists. Black and Latinx students do not do as well as their white peers, even as the school overall performs well. Brown sociology professor John B. Diamond has studied this phenomenon and attributes the gap to several factors, including implicit bias among teachers and administrators, and the oversized influence of white parents trying to get advantages for their children. In his book, Despite the Best Intentions: How Inequality Thrives in Good Schools, with his coauthor Amanda Lewis, they interview students, teachers, parents, administrators, and community members in a diverse suburban high school. In this Kappan interview, he discusses their research and how educators can disrupt the inequities in schools and districts.

        <title>The forces underlying the public school enrollment drop</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 30-37, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Recent headlines describing the national drop in public school enrollment suggest that this is a shocking crisis brought on or worsened by the pandemic. However, Abbie Cohen argues that the current enrollment decline should not be a surprise. The underlying causes have festered for decades. Among these causes is the tension between the different purposes of public schools. Those who see schools primarily as a means of social mobility have promoted a variety of school choice initiatives. These efforts have pulled resources out of traditional public schools, making it more difficult to reduce inequality and prepare all young people for participation in a democratic society. The shortcomings of public schools, particularly in urban communities, have fed a growing mistrust of schools, which leads more families to seek other options. These trends put at risk public schools’ ability to serve the public good.

        <title>Professional development for the science of reading</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 38-43, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Despite training in phonics and phonemic awareness during literacy methods courses, preservice teachers indicate having a limited understanding of how to apply these two critical components of reading in their own classrooms. As preservice teachers enter the classroom, they will need support from principals, literacy professionals, and colleagues to provide effective instruction in phonics and phonemic awareness. Stacey Bose proposes a three-tiered support system to provide a continuum of professional learning as preservice teachers transition from the university to the classroom.

        <title>The Editor’s Note: Stepping outside the little boxes</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Editor-in-Chief Teresa Preston discusses the highlights of the February 2023 issue of Kappan, which puts the spotlight on suburban schools. The growing diversity of the suburbs has sparked conflict as some community members speak out against change. And this conflict has implications for schools. Instead of taking sides against each other, communities need to look together for solutions to their shared problems.

        <title>Political battles in suburbia</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 6-10, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Media reports have shown suburban school officials being threatened and school board meetings erupting into chaos. Rachel S. White, Michael P. Evans, and Joel R. Malin examine whether these politically contentious experiences are occurring everywhere, or if there is something distinct about the contentiousness suburban superintendents face. Drawing on a national survey of superintendents, they asked: How do political experiences of rural, suburban, and urban superintendents differ? The results paint a bleak picture about the stresses of the superintendency, and the direct toll they have on some superintendents’ well-being. However, they also identify ways to support suburban superintendents as they face political challenges.

        <title>Backtalk: What principals need to know to respond to a crisis</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Principals face unexpected crises, big and small, regularly. Yet, as the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated, they aren’t always prepared for them when they come. Mario Jackson describes some of the challenges principals faced during the pandemic and the specific attributes that helped them manage. Specifically, equity-oriented leadership, crisis communication, and emotional intelligence skills were crucial to leaders during the pandemic. These skills can be beneficial in a variety of crises, and Jackson suggests that principal preparation programs help leaders grow in these areas.

        <title>Attendance zones in the suburbs</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 11-17, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; While suburban schools across the country have become increasingly racially and economically diverse in recent decades, many remain highly segregated. School attendance zone boundaries (AZBs) play a critical role in shaping these patterns of within-district segregation. AZBs are especially important in suburban areas with growing and diversifying student populations. Using novel, longitudinal AZB data dating back to 1990, authors Sarah Asson, Erica Frankenberg, Christopher Fowler, and Ruth Krebs Buck studied the relationship between AZBs and segregation over time in three large suburban districts. They found AZB changes have not yet been realized as a force for desegregation. To do so will require more explicit action prioritizing racial and economic diversity.

        <title>Collaborative deliberation in the classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 44-49, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; To expand students’ preparation for civic life, many teachers regularly engage students in discussions related to contentious issues. These discussions, however, typically restrict the range of communicative styles allowed and prioritizes disagreements between fixed and competing choices. Keith C. Barton &amp;amp; Li-Ching recommend that educators instead engage students in collaborative deliberation — an authentic problem-solving model of discussion that is premised on relationships, mutual trust, common interests and concerns, and diverse forms of communication. To support collaborative deliberation, teachers need to pay attention to how they frame issues, how they organize student groups, and what kinds of discourse they encourage.

        <title>Policy Solutions: It’s more than money: Supporting the Black school</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-59, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Former NFL football star Deion Sanders set off controversy when he announced he was leaving his post as head football coach at Mississippi’s Jackson State University, a historically Black college or university (HBCU), to go to University of Colorado. Jonathan E. Collins discusses how the concept of HBCUs could be taken up by public schools that primarily serve Black students. This would be preferable to considering majority Black schools as segregation failures lacking in resources.

        <title>Career Confidential: Teacher wants to motivate an apathetic student</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 63-65, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; In this regular column, Phyllis Fagell gives workplace advice to educators. This month, a teacher is frustrated that she can’t make much change at her school without becoming an administrator. Another teacher is concerned that the Negative Nellies at her school are bringing down the morale of new teachers. And a principal wants to know what to do about a teacher who is annoying her colleagues.

        <title>Leading for mindfulness</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-55, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; In the last 15 years, mindfulness programs have become more popular in schools. However, bringing mindfulness into schools involves more than selecting a curriculum. It entails creating the conditions for mindfulness that requires a particular kind of leadership: the capacity to lead for and with mindfulness. Authors Deborah L. Schussler, Karen Krisch, Julia Mahfouz, Rebecca N. Baelen, and Laura Feagans Gould highlight common principles and practical examples from educational leaders engaging in this work and share some of the emerging research into mindfulness in education.

        <title>Under the Law: Is there a sports advantage in suburbia?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/5&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 5&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-62, February 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Participation in school sports has a variety of benefits for students. But not all students are able to participate in school athletics programs. In this column, Robert Kim explores the different levels of access suburban, urban, and rural students have to sports programs. And he considers whether students, regardless of where they live, have a right of equitable access to sports. Rural schools may offer more opportunities to participate in sports than suburban or urban schools. But suburban students are more likely to feel locked out of sport participation, either because the available programs do not interest them or because they are too costly. However, suburban students who do participate in sports tend to start earlier and play more, often in programs outside school. Legal advocacy involving unequal access to school sports will require creativity and a broad approach to address statewide disparities.

        <title>The Safest Bet: Identifying and Assessing Risk in Faculty Selection</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Efforts to mitigate bias in faculty hiring processes are well-documented in the literature. Yet, significant barriers to the hiring of racially minoritized and White women in many STEM fields remain. An underreported barrier to inclusive hiring is assessment of risk. Guided by theory from behavioral economics, social psychology, and decision-making, we examine the inner workings of five faculty search committees to understand how committee members identified and assessed risk with particular attention to assessments of risk that became intermingled with social biases. Committees identified and assessed five risks, including candidate interest, candidate disciplinary expertise, candidate competence, candidate collegiality, and the timing and oversight of the search process itself. We discuss implications of risk identification and assessment for effective and inclusive searches.

        <title>Teacher Professional Development and Student Reading in Middle and High School: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This systematic review investigates the effect of teacher professional development (TPD) on adolescent students’ reading achievement in middle and high school. A systematic search of TPD and student reading achievement studies (1975–2020) identified 15 medium-quality articles meeting this study’s inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of 14 of these studies corrected by Hedges’ g showed that TPD on student reading was associated with a small overall effect of g = 0.062, p &amp;lt; .05 on student reading outcomes. However, the effect size was moderated by delivery of the TPD, TPD hours, student population, and assessment. None of the 14 studies reported TPD theory-driven quality indicators for TPD delivery (e.g., school support, use of technology, and promotion of self-reflection or reported measures of teacher change). Conclusion of findings in literacy TPD includes the need for TPD theory-driven studies.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The success of the teaching - learning process in terms of learning outcomes is determined by several factors, primarily the lecturer’s teaching approach used. Despite the importance of the teaching approach, little is known concerning the teaching approaches used by mathematics lecturers in Tanzanian higher education institutions. This study explores the lecturers’ perspectives regarding the teaching approaches they normally use in teaching mathematics, and what motivates their choices, within an emerging economy context. Data are collected through semi-structured interviews with 15 lecturers. Data are analysed using content analysis and descriptive statistics. The findings reveal that lecturers are more likely to choose teacher-centred approaches and that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;assurance of the right content&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;content coverage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;time-saving&lt;/em&gt; aspects are associated with choosing this approach. These findings provide insights into the current state in mathematics classroom regarding teaching approaches, and the motivation behind lecturers’ teaching approach choices, complementing current findings in the literature. We categorise the teaching approaches for mathematics teaching – learning by describing the interactions between the different actors in the classroom (teachers, students, and content) in order to inform and influence successful mathematics teaching practices in emerging economies such as Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;
