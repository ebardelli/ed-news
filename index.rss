        <title>Does It Matter Who Evaluates Teachers? Principal Versus Teacher-Led Evaluation and Teacher Motivation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Increasing job demands and continuing struggles to improve teacher evaluation practice raise the question of how peers might assist principals with teacher evaluation. Using a robust international sample (TALIS2013) of 36,411 teachers from 2,759 schools in 11 countries, we tested the hypothesis that teacher-led evaluation practices are associated with more teacher-reported positive changes in classroom practice, confidence, and motivation than principal-led evaluation practices in three areas evaluation: (1) classroom observations, (2) assessments of teacher content knowledge, and (3) analysis of student test score data. We found that teacher-led evaluation is associated with more positive feelings of motivation and change in practice for all three evaluation areas, but particularly for assessments of teacher content knowledge and test score data analysis. Further, principals’ reported use of extrinsic motivational tools to reward or punish teachers based upon their evaluation was also negatively associated with teachers’ motivation and reports of positive change in practice.

        <title>Handling Missing Data in Growth Mixture Models</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to compare methods for handling missing data in growth mixture models. The methods considered in the current study were (a) a fully Bayesian approach using a Gibbs sampler, (b) full information maximum likelihood using the expectation–maximization algorithm, (c) multiple imputation, (d) a two-stage multiple imputation method, and (e) listwise deletion. Of the five methods, it was found that the Bayesian approach and two-stage multiple imputation methods generally produce less biased parameter estimates compared to maximum likelihood or single imputation methods, although key differences were observed. Similarities and disparities among methods are highlighted and general recommendations articulated.

        <title>Epistemic and Deontic Authority in Parent–Teacher Conference: Referring to the Expert as a Discursive Practice to (Jointly) Undermine the Teacher’s Expertise</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article investigates the interactional constitution of a phenomenon recurrently reported by teachers who complain about a loss of authority, a systematic delegitimization of their role. Adopting a conversation analysis informed approach to a single-case study from a corpus of parent–teacher conferences, we illustrate how challenging the teachers’ expertise is accomplished by participants as an outcome of some identifiable communicative practices. Particularly, we analyze the practices of “quoting” and “referring to the expert” as interactional resources differently exploited by participants: While parents challenge the teachers’ epistemic authority and lay the foundation for claiming the right to decide what do to with their son in the classroom, teachers contribute to this epistemic positioning and cede their expert knowledge-based deontic rights, that is, the right to decide the best practices to adopt in the classroom. In the discussion, we advance that the participants’ interactive competence in navigating the complex epistemic landscape of the encounter profoundly impacts on the local definition of reciprocal epistemic and deontic rights and responsibilities. Indications for teachers’ education are provided in the conclusion.

        <title>Toward a Class-Conscious Approach to Cultural Responsiveness</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The last several decades have seen a growth in scholarship and application of culturally responsive and sustaining educational (CRSE) approaches in schools serving youth of color. A growing body of research has shown how CRSE serves as an effective strategy to engage students of color, combat pernicious stereotypes, and improve academic outcomes. Notwithstanding these important contributions, CRSE scholarship and practice have not fully explored the significance of social class, despite its long-standing correlation with academic performance, deep connections to identity, and relationship to race and racialization. Drawing on lessons gleaned from ethnographic research, which has demonstrated the importance of social-class analyses, this essay calls for a greater emphasis on and recognition of class in CRSE methods and application. As one of the most prominent and useful sets of pedagogical strategies used in education today, CRSE stands to benefit from a wider inclusion of social class, an addition that would have important ramifications for practitioners and scholars seeking to effectively educate historically marginalized populations. A deeper understanding of the significance of class could also help educators and scholars avoid perpetuating pernicious cultural stereotypes, such as the model minority myth and the culture of poverty. However, a class-conscious addition to CRSE must also maintain its anti-deficit perspective to avoid essentialist views about working-class youth.

        <title>Conceptualising critical mathematical thinking in young students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;International curriculum and policy directions have called to embed critical thinking across discipline areas including mathematics; however, conceptually, this is under-theorised and under-researched in the field of mathematics education. This paper presents the conceptualisation of critical mathematical thinking (CMT) and the application of a literature informed conceptual framework; in particular, it examines what CMT capabilities young students exhibit as they enter formal schooling. We present the findings from one-on-one task-based interviews, undertaken with 16 young students (aged 5–6) as a means to investigate their CMT capabilities and refine the CMT framework. The interview data were analysed using the new critical mathematical thinking conceptual framework. The data confirms the definition and understanding of CMT in young students, indicating a need for curriculum refinement, improved teaching practices, and further research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reducing Excellence Gaps: A Systematic Review of Research on Equity in Advanced Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Unequal access to advanced learning opportunities is among the most complex and controversial issues in American K–12 schools. Interventions that address policy, programming, and instruction can provide opportunities for students with advanced learning needs in school systems that prioritize minimum grade-level standards. Excellence gaps are differences in advanced performance among student subgroups that result from inequities in education and society. In this systematic review of the literature, the authors identified 80 empirical research studies on strategies for reducing excellence gaps published between 2010 and 2021 and identified themes related to the seven facets of the Excellence Gap Intervention Model (K–12 school accountability support, teacher professional learning, expanded advanced learning opportunities, universal screening with local norms, frontloading, flexible ability grouping, psychosocial interventions). This analysis revealed substantial evidence of intervention development over the past decade and suggests a revised approach to equitable, advanced education that begins with preparation (e.g., teacher professional learning, student frontloading) and is followed by placement, evaluation, and adjustment as students’ learning needs change.

        <title>An Exploration of the Experiences of Substitute Teachers: A Systematic Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article reports on a systematic review of literature on the experiences of substitute teachers, also known as casual or relief teachers. This occupational group are an essential part of school improvement efforts, allowing release time for other teachers to participate in professional learning, complete administrative duties, and attend to personal matters. Although a ubiquitous component of the teaching workforce, little is known about their work conditions, motivations, experiences, and support. This study involved a mixed-methods research synthesis approach. Peer-reviewed studies and dissertations that examined the experiences and needs of substitute teachers in primary/elementary, middle, and secondary/high schools were examined. The study found that, although substitute teachers are a heterogeneous group, their conditions and experiences are less than satisfactory, exacerbated by a lack of targeted support. Education systems need to consider professionalizing this occupational group further. In addition, systems need to develop policies and practices that improve substitute teachers’ work.

        <title>Leveraging What Students Know to Make Sense of Texts: What the Research Says About Prior Knowledge Activation</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This systematic literature review examined the research on prior knowledge and its activation to ascertain how these terms are defined, what specific techniques have been empirically investigated, and the conditions under which prior knowledge activation facilitated students’ comprehension. Fifty-four articles met the inclusion criteria and revealed that the terms prior knowledge and prior knowledge activation were often vaguely defined. Further, 30 unique techniques for activating readers’ prior knowledge representing eight different categories were identified. Those categories were open-ended prompts, procedural or strategic supports during reading, visual representations, analogical reasoning, text alteration, augmented activation, extratextual activities, and spontaneous activation. Techniques meant to facilitate knowledge activation prior to reading were most common, although the prompting of students’ existing knowledge was beneficial during and after reading as well. Variability in the effectiveness of activation techniques was related, in part, to the amount, accuracy, and specificity of students’ knowledge. Based on the key findings identified in this review, recommendations for future inquiry are forwarded, including suggested definitions of prior knowledge and prior knowledge activation.

        <title>A Thematic Review of STEM Education for Disadvantaged Students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present study proposed to thematically examine the studies on STEM education for disadvantaged students. International and national well-known databases (e.g., ERIC, PROQUEST Dissertations and Theses Global, ULAKBIM, Scopus, YOK-National Theses Center, and Google Scholar) were searched by means of keyword patterns (pattern 1: STEM education and disadvantaged students; pattern 2: STEM education and nondominant students; pattern 3: STEM education and underrepresented students). Then, the inclusion (e.g., STEM education for disadvantaged students, STEM careers/plans and their reasons) and exclusion (e.g., racial microaggressions in STEM education) criteria were applied. Thus, a total of 37 studies were appearant for the thematic review. Afterwards, the studies were analyzed in regard to the matrix (i.e., aims, methodologies, disadvantaged groups, intervention programmes, conclusions, and implications). The findings showed that such factors as socio-economic status, gender, ethnic/racial minority, and learning gap/disability influenced the disadvantaged students’ STEM careers. Therefore, future studies should cultivate these factors as moderator variables to drive disadvantaged students to the STEM careers and develop their potential competencies of STEM fields.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investigating a teacher-perspective on pedagogical mathematical practices: possibilities for using mathematical practice to develop pedagogy in mathematical coursework</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;One of the challenges of university mathematics courses in secondary teacher preparation is incorporating pedagogical discussions. The focus in a mathematics course is—and should be—on mathematics. But research also suggests that without addressing pedagogical implications these content courses are not meaningful to secondary teachers’ future classroom practice. The thrust of this paper is exploring ideas for how to leverage mathematical practice in university mathematics courses—and, in particular, what have been described as Pedagogical Mathematical Practices (PMPs). The paper reports on a study of (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 10) pre- and in-service mathematics teachers that explored the viability of the PMP construct, with the intent of specifying particular PMPs. Drawing on interviews with teacher participants who had recent experiences in an inquiry-oriented discrete mathematics course, the study reports on the ways in which they identified a set of mathematical practices as being productive pedagogically. The study contributes a teacher-perspective on the construct of PMPs, including the identification of four PMPs from the study data: explicit visualization; multiple approaches; concrete exemplification; and informal justification. Implications for their potential use in university mathematics courses with regard to teacher education are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prospective Secondary Teachers’ Emergent Knowledge and Beliefs: Inquiry-Oriented Differential Equations Contributing to Teacher Preparation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article reports on the evolution of prospective secondary teachers’ knowledge (meanings for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt;) and beliefs (about teaching and learning mathematics) in a semester-long inquiry-oriented differential equations class. Students entered the course with limited, primarily procedural, meanings for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq2&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt;. Throughout the semester, they engaged in collaborative mathematical inquiry using a research-based curriculum. As viewed through the emergent perspective, students’ meanings for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq3&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; and their beliefs about teaching and learning mathematics co-evolved with community norms and practices through the classroom discourse. Students’ end-of-term portfolios and portfolio presentations were analyzed for evidence of meanings for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq4&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; and beliefs about students’ roles, instructors’ roles, and the general nature of learning mathematics. In these, students expressed rich, multifaceted meanings for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq5&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; and beliefs about learning as an active process of meaning-making. While many prospective teachers do not see the relevance of advanced mathematics coursework to their career, these students reflected on their experiences in the course and volunteered ways in which their emerging knowledge and beliefs would influence their future practice. We emphasize that the classroom norms supported students in pursuing connections themselves, and conjecture that similar norms would support the development of reflective practitioners in other contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lower secondary students’ encounters with mathematical literacy</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Worldwide, there has been an increased emphasis on enabling students to recognise the real-world significance of mathematics. Mathematical literacy is a notion used to define the competencies required to meet the demands of life in modern society. In this article, students’ encounters with mathematical literacy are investigated. The data comprises interviews with 22 students and observations of 16 mathematics lessons in three grade 9 classes in Norway. The analysis shows that students’ encounters with mathematical literacy concern specific mathematical topics and contexts from personal and work life. Students’ encounters with ML in school is characterised by an emphasis on developing mathematical knowledge within the school context.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Complementary measures of conceptual understanding: a case about triangle concepts</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics curricula from many countries have emphasized conceptual understanding as more important than the mastery of isolated skills. However, researchers and educators have used different measures to access students’ conceptual understanding of mathematics. Thus, it seems necessary to further explore whether and to what extent different measurement techniques could lead to coherent findings. Therefore, this study compares the techniques that are commonly used in school settings with those proposed by researchers as effective in addressing conceptual understanding. Specifically, this study compares three techniques used to assess the quality of the conceptual understanding of triangles, conducted among a class of grade 8 students in China. The three techniques were a definition-example-nonexample test, a concept-mapping task, and a traditional paper-and-pencil test on the operations of the concepts and their relationships. The results show that these techniques provide complementary, rather than convergent, insights into students’ conceptual understanding. Their strengths and limitations in addressing students’ conceptual understanding were identified. The findings not only provide information for researchers, educators, and classroom teachers in identifying alternative techniques in assessing conceptual understanding but also a more holistic view of students’ conceptual understanding when different perspectives of this understanding are made explicit.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elementary prospective teachers’ visions of moving beyond mathematics anxiety</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies of prospective elementary mathematics teachers’ mathematics anxiety have documented that many prospective teachers often worry about managing their repeated experiences of anxiety while developing their pedagogical and content knowledge to teach mathematics. The literature further indicates the importance of developing learning opportunities for prospective teachers to confront their past experiences while they (re)learn and learn to teach mathematics during methods courses. This study is situated within one such learning opportunity and seeks to analyze potential mathematics anxiety coping strategies generated by forty-eight prospective elementary teachers enrolled in a mathematical methods course. Written responses generated by the prospective teachers were subjected to qualitative thematic analysis to identify patterns of key ideas related to lesson planning for content they felt anxious and/or not confident about teaching and patterns focused on episodes of mathematics anxiety they might experience in the moment of teaching mathematics. Findings indicate that prospective teachers envision using between two and seven strategies grouped across eight coping strategy themes when given the opportunity to reflect on how they might deal with future instances of anxiety when they are tasked with teaching mathematics to their students. We highlight how some of the coping strategies that the prospective teachers envisioned as a means to cope with mathematics anxiety may have more potential to be helpful than others and present implications of our research for mathematics teacher educators.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Embracing pivotal teaching moments: elementary teachers’ role in advancing high cognitive levels of mathematics discourse</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The study of pivotal teaching moments (PTMs) offers significant insights into mathematics classroom interactions. PTMs are student-generated instances within a lesson that provide opportunities for teachers to modify planned instruction (Stockero &amp;amp; Van Zoest, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r32&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;). Given the importance of interactions and discourse in students’ mathematical growth and understanding, we examine them in the context of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PTM episode triples.&lt;/em&gt; PTM episode triples consist of three main elements: (1) a PTM, (2) a teacher response to the PTM, and (3) the immediately ensuing student utterance. Analysis of data from nine elementary mathematics lessons shows that teacher responses that explicitly “pursued students’ thinking” elicited significantly higher cognitive levels of student discourse than teachers who &amp;quot;ignored or dismissed&amp;quot; PTMs or simply &amp;quot;acknowledged [PTMs] but continued as planned.&amp;quot; While many researchers have focused on PTM episode “doubles” (combinations of student-generated interruptions and the teacher’s response), no studies to our knowledge have addressed PTM episode “triples” as we have. Implications of these findings prove helpful for identifying concrete ways that educators can increase the cognitive level of student discourse within their classrooms. Further, our integration and modification of existing theory and frameworks for analyzing PTM episode triples—incorporating the relationship between PTMs and teachers’ responses to them, on the one hand, and the cognitive level of the ensuing student utterance, on the other hand—are a unique contribution to the field and provide a method by which researchers and educators can study classroom practice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eliciting mathematical reasoning during early primary problem solving</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematical reasoning, which plays a critical role in students’ capacity to make sense of mathematics, is now emphasised more strongly in various curricula internationally. However, reasoning is sometimes difficult for teachers to recognise, let alone teach. This case study considers video of one teacher’s implementation of a problem-solving lesson in a year 1 primary school class in Australia. It examines the opportunities this teacher provided to leverage reasoning and contributes to the body of knowledge on ways reasoning may be elicited during problem solving. The new Eliciting Mathematical Reasoning Framework arising from the analysis of the data in this study builds on and extends previous research. It provides a tool to support researchers, teacher educators, professional learning providers, and teachers in recognising and eliciting reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making the most of packing away: identifying mathematical opportunities for very young preverbal children</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Very young preverbal children (aged around 12 months) actively engage with their environment, whether at home, on outings, or in early learning centres. Their engagement with their environment can occur in many different ways involving physical and mental activities. In an early learning centre, there are many activities that very young preverbal children engage with on a daily basis. These activities may be fully child-initiated, fully educator-initiated, or somewhere in-between, but all will involve mathematics. It is important that the mathematics that these very young preverbal children might demonstrate in the actions undertaken during their activities are identified as it will provide the early childhood educator with an indication of the child’s mathematical understandings. Psychological research has demonstrated very young children engage in mathematical thinking, which leads to the question of how the mathematical thinking of very young preverbal children in a learning centre setting can be identified. This paper uses 360° video to explore how an everyday activity that would occur for very young preverbal children—packing away toys—could be used to identify the mathematical thinking the very young preverbal child may engage with by examining their actions. The identified mathematics is linked to research and documentation that outlines what mathematics very young preverbal children may understand. The importance of identifying the mathematics in the actions of very young children as part of the role of the early childhood educator is also considered.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can a number of diagrams linked to a proof task in 3D geometry improve proving ability?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The current study attempts to investigate whether using multiple diagrams attached to a geometry task could reduce difficulties in the proving process regarding concepts in three-dimensional geometry. Ninety 12th-grade students participated in the study. The research included the use of a questionnaire whose items invited open-ended responses regarding two tasks. Interviews were also conducted with some participants. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. The results revealed a correlation between the students’ responses and the number of diagrams they received. Students who were given several diagrams gave more correct responses and correct and complete proofs than students who were given only one diagram presenting several diagrams attached to the proof task reduce the visual obstacles that students face in constructing geometrical proofs. The findings from the interviews support the results from the questionnaires; interviews revealed presenting further diagrams allow students to adapt their proving processes.&lt;/p&gt;
