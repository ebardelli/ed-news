        <title>We need to know more about CTE teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-23, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Over the past year, debates over the prevalence, distribution, and effects of teacher vacancy and underqualification have dominated many education narratives. Authors J. Cameron Anglum, Andrew R. Diemer, Walter G. Ecton, and Tuan D. Nguyen consider these debates in the context of growing interest in career and technical education (CTE) in high school settings. Research on secondary CTE teachers, including the quantification of teacher shortages in specific CTE content areas, remains insufficient to inform effective recruitment and retention policies. This dearth of scholarship on CTE teachers undermines the improvement of CTE programs.

        <title>Teacher academies that make a difference NOW</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-28, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;A majority of students in career and technical education teacher academies indicate that they do not want to be educators. Recognizing this, Skyline High School propelled its teacher academy program in a new direction and redesigned it in a way that is mutually beneficial to the teacher academy students, preK-12 learners, and the education workforce. R. Lennon Audrain and Gregory Mendez recount how, working in close partnership with its district human resources department and Arizona State University, Skyline’s teacher academy students develop pedagogical content knowledge about the science of reading, apply it tutoring experiences at a local elementary school, and earn industry credentials that signal specialized knowledge and skills.

        <title>Advantages of career learning in the early grades: A conversation with Ed Hidalgo</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 29-33, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Career exploration traditionally starts in middle school. However, there are advantages to starting discussions about career and preference in the early grades. California’s Cajon Valley Union School District is using the World of Work curriculum systemically from kindergarten to high school. Children learn about their personality types, do activities related to professions, and hear from professionals. Ed Hidalgo, who developed the curriculum and helped put it into practice at Cajon Valley, talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the advantages of starting in the early grades, as well as the importance of encourage students to understand and explore their strengths and preferences.

        <title>How to make more valid decisions about assessment data</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 34-39, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Those asked to make valid decisions with data don’t have the technical knowledge to understand nuance around data quality, assessment aims, and statistical limitations that influence how they should interpret the data. This reality is what Greg Thompson, Leslie Rutkowski, and David Rutkowski call the validity paradox. Educators can surmount this paradox by following a five-step model in which they make a claim, make the opposite claim, and then determine how well both claims are supported by the available evidence. This process can enable practicing educators to make more valid decisions based on data.

        <title>Kappan call for manuscripts, 2023-24</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 70-71, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Kappan’s new publishing year starts in September. We’re looking for research into long-term trends showing improvement or consistent promise, pieces on how schools are evolving to better meet the needs of students and families, and stories of programs that effectively address problems in schools and communities.

        <title>The Editor’s Note: Prepared for what?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;A 2022 survey showed that Americans see career preparation as a higher priority for schools than college preparation, making career and technical education (CTE) increasingly relevant. Teresa Preston previews the March 2023 issue of Kappan, focused on CTE. The issue explores the outcomes of CTE programs and what potential benefits of CTE programs might be for students.

        <title>The equity dilemma</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 40-43, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;School leaders juggle the often-inconsistent goals of maintaining support of middle- and upper-income families for public education and, at the same time, implementing policies to strengthen equity for low-income students. Author Iris C. Rotberg describes how these tradeoffs play out in different communities, the role of concentrated poverty and segregation, and potential options for making equity gains while maintaining widespread support for public education.

        <title>Putting evidence on CTE to work</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 6-11, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Policy makers have taken more interest in career and technical education (CTE) in recent years, but evidence regarding what kinds of programs produce the most important outcomes is still emerging. Shaun M. Dougherty summarizes what recent research tells us about the impact of these programs. Evidence has shown that CTE-dedicated schools, career academies, and programs linked to workforce needs can improve high school graduation rates and workforce earnings, but research is still emerging on how well CTE programs prepare students for postsecondary education. Most of the recent research has not focused on equity in CTE programs, and educators must remain vigilant to ensure equitable access and outcomes.

        <title>Industry-recognized certifications for college- and career-readiness</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 12-17, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Industry-recognized certifications (IRCs) are designed by businesses, industrial groups, and state agencies to enable students to demonstrate their skills related to a specific profession and to enable industries to know whether potential employees are qualified for specific jobs. To understand the value of these certifications, Matt Giani analyzed data from more than a million Texas public high school graduates. The data showed some positive relationships between IRCs and students’ future earnings and college enrollment and persistence, but the links are sometimes weak and vary depending on the IRC earned. And most students earning an IRC did not move on to work or postsecondary study in areas aligned with their credentials.

        <title>On Leadership: A value proposition for a new era</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Events of recent years have led many students and parents alike to question why schools work the way that they do. Students have asked why they should have to come to class when they can do the work at home. Community members have questioned why students are having to learn about contentious issues. While not all of questions are equally valid, education leaders have a responsibility to provide some kind of answer. Joshua P. Starr suggests that the answer comes down to ensuring that the value proposition for schools is clear. And in this new era, the development of community may be among the most important value propositions for public schools.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Federal designation for Black K-12 schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 56-57, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The forces against school integration are relentless. Societal and marketplace decisions create segregated schools even in racially integrated areas in the suburbs. Jonathan E. Collins suggests creating a federal designation for public schools called the Black-serving institution (BSI), similar to historically Black colleges and universities. Schools that serve a majority Black student population would receive incentives that would help the school, students, staff, and the community. The BSI is a strategic initiative for supporting the schools full of Black students that white middle class parents actively work to keep their children from attending.

        <title>Under the Law: CTE: A checkered legal history</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-60, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Career and technical education (also known as vocational education) has been in existence since at least the 19th century as a means of preparing students for employment. However, for much of the 20th century, it also has served to segregate students, even after such segregation was deemed illegal. Robert Kim describes the legal history of career and technical education (CTE). Although many of today’s CTE programs show positive outcomes for students of historically marginalized backgrounds, policy makers and education leaders must understand how CTE programs differ across communities and be prepared to apply new understandings of equity to these programs.

        <title>Career Confidential: Teacher concerned that parents don’t trust teachers anymore</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 61-63, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this regular Kappan column, Phyllis Fagell gives advice to educators. This month, a teacher wants to set better boundaries with parents don’t seem to trust teachers and want to have input on every decision. A principal has noticed that students are only hanging out with kids from their own social class, creating a “haves” and “have nots” culture at the school. Another teacher keeps hearing about colleagues who are looking for jobs in higher-paying districts and wonders if it’s time to jump ship, despite being generally happy in her current job.

        <title>Backtalk: The controversy of teaching CRT in K-12</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Equity initiatives and critical race theory (CRT) have recently emerged as an urgent agenda for K-12 schools. Jung-ah Choi argues that CRT is a useful framework but that teaching CRT principles to young children may have deleterious effects. In particular, it could undermine two bedrock notions: educational equality and meritocracy. It is not children but adults (specifically, educators) who need to focus on how racism has shaped school policies, curricula, instructional methods, and day-to-day interactions.

        <title>The power of teachers’ perceptions</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 44-49, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Florida’s Broward County Public Schools and the University of Chicago engaged in a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) to scale teacher practices that support students’ critical thinking. As part of the RPP, Jeanne Century’s research team conducted research to determine what barriers might limit the spread of these practices. The findings show that teacher biases about students’ ability to engage in critical thinking, as well as their self-efficacy, might limit the extent to which teachers are willing to change their practices. Because teacher perceptions have been linked to students’ race, gender, and socioeconomic status, these perceptions may have consequences for efforts to promote equity. To improve teacher perceptions, districts can change their messaging about student abilities, boost teacher self-efficacy, and directly address teacher perceptions.

        <title>Mochilas of excellence</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/6&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-53, March 2023. &lt;br/&gt;For decades, the education system has struggled to serve Latinx students, viewing them in a way that focuses on their deficits. However, Latinx scholars have proposed a series of asset-based frameworks to reframe and reshape how we see and treat Latinx students in the U.S. system. Using the Dora the Explorer’s mochila (backpack) as a metaphor to capture the assets Latinx students bring to the classroom, Louie Rodriguez proposes that teachers think of Latinx students as carrying mochilas of excellence into the classroom. This framing encourages educators to recognize and develop Latinx student agency and help them realize the power and promise of education in their lives.

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and the triad of schema development are used as the framework in this study to investigate students’ understanding of the concept of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;circle&lt;/em&gt;. In this report, results are presented from the data analysis of responses to questions in semi-structured interviews of 15 students enrolled in a college geometry course at a university. This report utilizes a framework describing the interaction of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Taxicab geometry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Euclidean geometry&lt;/em&gt; schemata to determine what components of these, and what relationships between them, were evoked when these participating students elaborated on their understanding of the circle concept. By adapting and transferring their knowledge of concepts back and forth between these two geometries, the participants demonstrated a variety of levels of schema interaction when responding to interview questions pertaining to circles. As a result, a model of schema interaction and pedagogical suggestions to help students better develop their &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;circle schema&lt;/em&gt; are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prospective primary teachers’ efficacy to teach mathematics: measuring efficacy beliefs and identifying the factors that influence them</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Prospective teachers’ mathematics efficacy beliefs affect school placement experiences and influence later teacher behaviour and subsequent student outcomes. These efficacy beliefs are open to change during initial teacher education and become more resistant to change once the teacher enters the workforce. Therefore, it is important to measure mathematics teacher efficacy early in initial teacher education and identify low efficacy beliefs. This study measured the mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs of 402 prospective primary teachers. Arising from Rasch analysis of the efficacy scores of these teachers, 22 participants who displayed a range of mathematics teaching efficacy beliefs were interviewed to gain insights into factors affecting these beliefs. Participants communicated greater confidence in tasks requiring procedural (tell-items) than conceptual knowledge (explain-items). Both low and high efficacy participants reported traditional experiences of mathematics teaching and learning as students. However, high efficacy participants reported mastery of mathematics within these traditional contexts, whereas their low efficacy peers did not report mastery. Furthermore, all participants reported how memories of their school mathematics experiences informed their level of efficacy when thinking about teaching mathematics, thus revealing the powerful influence of mastery experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The interplay between the guidance from the digital learning environment and the teacher in supporting folding back</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies have proposed that students’ mathematical understanding develops dynamically through the process known as folding back, in which learners revisit earlier forms of understanding and use them to build even deeper levels of mathematical understanding. Digital learning environments, where students can manipulate representations, are often used to enable students to notice properties, patterns, or rules. When working in such an environment, students usually receive support from the environment and the teacher. The interplay between these different sources of support is important according to previous studies. In this study, we examine this interplay in the case of folding back. The study aims to understand how the teacher, together with the learning environment, can support the process of folding back. We collected data from second, fourth, and sixth grade students as they worked in groups to develop a rule for balancing a balance beam in a digital learning environment designed to support folding back. One pre-service teacher guided each three-student group. Data were analyzed by identifying occasions for folding back and characterizing different ways in which the interplay between the teacher and the environment supported students’ folding back. We found different kinds of synergy between the two sources of support. The teachers followed up on and augmented the support from the environment, initiated supplementary folding back, and reinforced the support from the environment. We also found non-synergy between the two sources of support, when the teachers’ support was not aligned with support from the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
