        <title>Inclusive citizenship through mathematics education: a conceptual investigation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Citizenship is a contested concept that can be interpreted from different – and also conflicting – perspectives. Inspired by inclusive mathematics education, we try to illustrate what it could mean to work toward inclusive citizenship. We illustrate the idea of inclusive mathematics education, showing how deaf and hearing students can learn together. We interpret inclusive mathematics education as ‘meetings amongst differences’. This interpretation inspires us to see meetings amongst differences in a broader perspective. Such meetings can be considered fundamental to the process of establishing inclusive citizenship. We elaborate on this idea by exemplifying how meetings across national, economic, cultural and existential differences can be established in mathematics education. We conclude that, to work toward inclusive citizenship, it is important to establish dialogues across distances; to make students interested in and able to see situations and problems from perspectives different from their own; to construct tolerance as an expression of shared concerns; and finally, to challenge any form of We–Other dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Consistent Are Meanings of “Evidence-Based”? A Comparative Review of 12 Clearinghouses that Rate the Effectiveness of Educational Programs</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Clearinghouses set standards of scientific quality to vet existing research to determine how “evidence-based” an intervention is. This paper examines 12 educational clearinghouses to describe their effectiveness criteria, to estimate how consistently they rate the same program, and to probe why their judgments differ. All the clearinghouses value random assignment, but they differ in how they treat its implementation, how they weight quasi-experiments, and how they value ancillary causal factors like independent replication and persisting effects. A total of 1359 programs were analyzed over 10 clearinghouses; 83% of them were assessed by a single clearinghouse and, of those rated by more than one, similar ratings were achieved for only about 30% of the programs. This high level of inconsistency seems to be mostly due to clearinghouses disagreeing about whether a high program rating requires effects that are replicated and/or temporally persisting. Clearinghouses exist to identify “evidence-based” programs, but the inconsistency in their recommendations of the same program suggests that identifying “evidence-based” interventions is still more of a policy aspiration than a reliable research practice.

        <title>Exploring children’s negotiation of meanings about “D” in 2D and 3D shapes in a year 5/6 New Zealand primary classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mathematical construct of dimension is one of the fundamental ideas for developing a sound understanding of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shapes. Yet, research in mathematics education has rarely explored children’s understanding of dimension in primary education. This paper explores how year 5/6 (9 to 11 years old) children construct and negotiate their meanings about dimension while engaging in classroom interactions about 2D and 3D shapes during geometry lessons in a New Zealand (NZ) English-medium multilingual primary classroom. Transcribed data of two key moments selected from six audiovisually recorded geometry lessons are presented. The findings suggest that children may use different discursive constructions—“another world”, “different ways to go”, and “flat vs fat”—to display their meanings about dimension. The findings also suggest that children and teacher participants may use prosodic features of their languages to interactionally construct the meanings of these discursive constructions. The paper discusses these findings in light of current research literature and offers a few implications for curriculum development and future research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A framework for analysing the relationships between peer interactions and learners’ mathematical identities: accounting for personal and social identities</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The absence of discussions of identity that consider both subjective/personal and social aspects of identity is an important concern in mathematics education research. This paper proposes a framework to analyse the mathematical identities offered to and constructed by learners during peer interactions, by considering personal and social identities. To exemplify the framework, we discuss how two pairs of secondary school learners, who were engaged with similarly by their teachers and who performed similarly academically, interacted with each other and offered and constructed micro-identities during moments of a lesson, and macro-identities across lessons. We show that when learners were offered identities by a peer as higher, lower or equal status, they constructed their identities by affiliating with or resisting the identities offered by their peer. Their interactions and the identities that they constructed were informed by their personal identities, including their emotions when learning mathematics, and their social identities, including their choices to occupy certain roles in the classroom community.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rethinking Dispositions in Teaching and Teacher Education: Virtue and the Manners of Democracy as a Way of Life</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As long as there have been teachers, there has been an expectation that they be of good character and model virtue. The author describes developments in the thought about teacher dispositions and identifies specific shortcomings in the effort to define and assess them as part of teacher education program accreditation. Virtue ethics as an alternative conceptual possibility is considered but found wanting. Seeking to identify a moral framework capable of supporting education, including teacher education program development, he suggests focus on the “manners” of democracy that arise from an analysis of democracy as a distinctive way of life, an essential social and civic practice. Five manners are suggested: hospitality, attuned listening, voice, reflectivity, and evidential discernment. Each manner is briefly described and discussed.

        <title>State Education Agency Governance, Virtual Learning, and Student Privacy: Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The rapid transition to emergency remote teaching in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic altered public education as schools closed across the United States. Eighty percent of teachers reported interacting with students online, often utilizing free technology like Zoom and Google Workspace for Education. This article provides a comprehensive overview of state education agencies’ recommendations for emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 school closures in early 2020. Reviewing 337 publicly available documents from 50 state education agencies reveals a fragmented response: state education agencies relied on nongovernmental organizations to do the work of governance.

        <title>High School Students’ Expectations and College Aspirations: Causes and Consequences</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on the disparities between the educational aspirations and expectations of high school students in the U.S., and explores why students do not expect to earn a bachelor’s degree despite their aspirations. Using a national dataset and logistic/multinomial logistic regression analyses, the study identified the factors associated with this diminished expectation, such as family background, school experiences, and college preparedness activities. Additionally, students with low expectations of reaching their college aspirations are less likely to search for, apply to, and/or enroll in 4-year colleges. This study provides new insights into the college access process.

        <title>Online Credit Recovery as an Intervention for High School Students Who Fail Courses</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Online credit recovery (OCR) refers to online courses that high school students take after previously failing the course. Many have suggested that OCR courses are helping students to graduate from high school without corresponding increases in academic skills. This study analyzes administrative data from the state of North Carolina to evaluate the efficacy of OCR using full data from public and private OCR providers. Findings indicate that students who fail courses and enroll in OCR are 20 percentage points more likely to earn course credit, have lower test scores of up to two tenths of a standard deviation, and are about eight percentage points more likely to graduate high school within 4 years than students who repeat courses traditionally. Test score differences are particularly large for Biology compared to Math I and English II. Hispanic and economically disadvantaged OCR students are more likely to graduate high school than their peers.

        <title>Handling Missing Data in Cross-Classified Multilevel Analyses: An Evaluation of Different Multiple Imputation Approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular method for handling missing data. In education research, it can be challenging to use MI because the data often have a clustered structure that need to be accommodated during MI. Although much research has considered applications of MI in hierarchical data, little is known about its use in cross-classified data, in which observations are clustered in multiple higher-level units simultaneously (e.g., schools and neighborhoods, transitions from primary to secondary schools). In this article, we consider several approaches to MI for cross-classified data (CC-MI), including a novel fully conditional specification approach, a joint modeling approach, and other approaches that are based on single- and two-level MI. In this context, we clarify the conditions that CC-MI methods need to fulfill to provide a suitable treatment of missing data, and we compare the approaches both from a theoretical perspective and in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate the use of CC-MI in real data and discuss the implications of our findings for research practice.
