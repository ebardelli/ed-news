        <title>A Systematic Review of the Literature on Inservice Professional Development Explicitly Addressing Race and Racism</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This systematic literature review examines research on U.S. professional development (PD) in which practicing teachers are asked to engage explicitly with race and racism. Using Kennedy’s PD theories of action, this review examines 64 studies published from 1981 to 2019 and analyzes race-related PD goals, pedagogical approaches, and documented outcomes of PD. The body of scholarship shows an array of PD program goals, often-limited pedagogical explicitness and detail, and descriptive and developmental outcomes. Recent scholarship has centered racial-equity-oriented teachers and teachers of Color and identified PD characteristics associated with positive outcomes. Extant literature has seldom directly documented PD transfer and incorporation in schools or documented PD impact on students. Areas for future research include further leveraging scholarship on change processes including teacher learning and PD effectiveness, documenting teacher development beyond PD sessions, probing affordances of different PD settings and formats, and examining how PD ultimately impacts student experience.

        <title>Training Teachers to Teach Probability: A Promising Research Area</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this commentary, I reflect on the relevant role that the education of teachers imply to assure a successful teaching of probability at school levels. Unfortunately, research on this issue is still scarce. In this sense, the four papers included in this section are welcome because they approach this research problem from different perspectives. I analyse these perspectives using the Didactic-Mathematics Knowledge and Competences Model (CCDM) developed at the University of Granada, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Series of problems in Clairaut’s Elements of Geometry: interaction between historical analysis and mathematics education research</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, I propose an analysis of the structure of Clairaut’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Éléments de Géométrie&lt;/em&gt; (1741), a book presenting geometrical knowledge organized around problems, with rich metadiscourse connecting problems and other elements of mathematical content. This analysis is inspired both by the “Series of problems at the crossroad of cultures” interdisciplinary history of sciences project, in which texts from various cultures structured around problems were analysed, and by ongoing mathematics educational research on the Hungarian &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Guided Discovery&lt;/em&gt; approach, where “series of problems” play a central role in the planning and implementation of teaching trajectories. I show how a dialog between the analysis of Clairaut’s historical text and mathematics educational research contributes to the reflection on the construction and analysis of inquiry based teaching trajectories in mathematics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Critical Translingual Perspectives on California Multilingual Education Policy</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Policies restricting bilingual education have yielded to policy frameworks touting its benefits. This shift corresponds with evolving lines of debate, focusing now on how bilingual education can best support racialized bilingual learners. One element of this new debate is the perspective on language underlying curriculum in bilingual programs, with a focus on translanguaging– normalization of the language practices of bilingual communities and positing that bilinguals draw from a singular linguistic repertoire. This article examines initiatives undertaken in California between 2010 and 2019 using Critical Policy Analysis. The work highlights that while opportunities for translanguaging have arisen, tensions between heteroglossic perspectives and the impulses toward standardization and commodification of language undermine such possibilities, and that notable gaps remain between teacher preparation frameworks and intended pedagogical practice.

        <title>Whiteness and Ability: Discourses in Disability History Curriculum Legislation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This Policy Discourse Analysis (PDA) explores 19 state legislative documents focused on the teaching of disability history in K-12 schools. Framed through critical perspectives on constructions of disability and race, alongside discourse theory, we iteratively analyzed these legislative documents to understand (a) how disability and disability history are constructed (particularly in relation to whiteness); and (b) the stated purpose of the legislation and who is meant to benefit materially as a result of the laws. We find the legislation upholds dominant notions of whiteness and ability as part of school curriculum, while simultaneously constructing disability history as in the past and disability justice as already achieved, centering the learning and awareness of white, nondisabled students. We offer discussion and implications for research and practice surrounding policy implementation of teaching disability history.

        <title>Forecasting Undergraduate Majors: A Natural Language Approach</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Committing to a major is a fateful step in an undergraduate education, yet the relationship between courses taken early in an academic career and ultimate major issuance remains little studied at scale. Using transcript data capturing the academic careers of 26,892 undergraduates enrolled at a private university between 2000 and 2020, we describe enrollment histories by using natural-language methods and vector embeddings to forecast terminal major on the basis of course sequences beginning at college entry. We find that (a) a student’s very first enrolled course predicts their major 30 times better than random guessing and more than one-third better than majority-class voting, (b) modeling strategies substantially influence forecasting metrics, and (c) course portfolios vary substantially within majors, such that students with the same major exhibit relatively modest overlap.

        <title>Theory of action: The care and feeding of your mission</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-47, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; In education, we share a common commitment to supporting students’ growth and development, but we often have different ideas about what that support looks like. A theory of action describes how a specific education organization intends to work to create the outcomes it wants. Abby Javurek Andres and Chase Nordengren describe how to develop and enact a theory of action that meets the needs of the school community. The process involves bringing people together to gain understanding of the problem, learning what is going well and building a shared vision of success, and aligning communications and decision-making around the shared vision.

Hyslop, who worked on regulations and guidance of ESSA implementation at the U.S. Department of Education, also discusses the implications of the recent NAEP scores and what may happen to ESSA accountability and school improvement plans in the post-pandemic world.

        <title>How to respond to community concerns about critical race theory</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 48-53, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Many school leaders responded to the controversies over critical race theory with denial. That approach can backfire, according to Emily Hodge, Francesca López, and Joshua Rosenberg. They suggest proactive messaging, which can help prevent leaders from falling into the trap of reactively defending their practices and letting the direction of the conversation be guided by those with the most extreme views.

        <title>Be accountable for teacher diversity</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 22-23, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Rudy Ruiz and Faith Connolly propose a new accountability measure that captures the percentage of students in a school that have a teacher of a similar ethno-racial background. The measure would hold school districts accountable for the percentage of students who have a teacher who looks like them. Adding this measure would bring attention to recruiting and retaining teachers of color and improve outcomes for students of color.

        <title>Can grades be an effective form of feedback?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 36-41, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Although grades are often portrayed as detrimental to students’ motivation and interest in learning, closer analysis of the evidence indicates that when used appropriately, grades can be a meaningful and effective form of feedback. Thomas R. Guskey clarifies how studies on grades are frequently misinterpreted, explains how grades offer important but insufficient information on students’ learning progress, and describes conditions that must be met for grades to serve as a meaningful and effective form of feedback for students.

        <title>Defining, measuring, and supporting the success of equity officers</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-21, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; As more K-12 school districts have hired equity officers, questions have arisen about their role and effectiveness. A recent Heritage Foundation report, for example, found that schools with equity officers have the lowest achievement outcomes. Mary Rice-Boothe and Tanji Reed Marshall point out, however, that student achievement is not the only metric for determining the success of equity officers. When holding equity officers accountable, it’s important to be clear about the expectations for the role, establish appropriate measurements to assess their effectiveness, and provide supports that set the leaders up for success.

        <title>Abeyance agreements: Evading Accountability for disciplinary actions?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/3&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-28, November 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Schools across the United States use abeyance agreements as an alternative to suspension or expulsion, yet little is known about them. These agreements allow students to avoid or reduce suspensions or expulsions, if they meet the terms of the agreement and waive certain due process rights. David Perrodin argues that these agreements enable school districts to circumvent requirements to report disciplinary data, a requirement intended to ensure schools’ disciplinary practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. These agreements appear to give students on the brink of suspension a second chance, but the terms are sometimes difficult to follow, and once the terms are broken, students may be subject to suspension without due process. They also bring disciplinary investigations to a quick close, sometimes without a clear understanding of the root causes of the misbehavior. And the lack of data about abeyance agreements means that authorities lose information that is useful in identifying potential safety threats or uncovering schools’ violations of students’ rights. Perrodin argues for the elimination of abeyance agreements for school discipline or for more standardized processes that can be tracked and that do not interfere with students’ rights.
