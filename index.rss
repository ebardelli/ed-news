        <title>Centering Equity in Teacher Education Evaluation: From Principles to Transformative Enactment</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Since the early 2000s, accountability and evaluation have been regarded by policymakers as key mechanisms for “fixing” teacher education and by many teacher education leaders as vehicles for elevating the status of the profession and uniting a fragmented field. Although educational inequity has been an enduring and endemic problem during the same time period, most major policy proposals regarding teacher education evaluation and accountability have said very little about equity. This article makes an argument for equity-centered teacher education evaluation and accountability by highlighting nine innovative examples that collectively illustrate what it means and what it looks like to position equity at the center of teacher education evaluation/accountability. Together, these examples are intended to be generative, providing a lens into how the interrelated dimensions of strong equity-centered evaluation play out at different sites of practice and how equity initiatives emerge and operate at different levels of policy.

        <title>Observing Intellectual Need and its Relationship with Undergraduate Students’ Learning of Calculus</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The concept of intellectual need, which proposes that learning is the result of students wrestling with a problem that is unsolvable by their current knowledge, has been used in instructional design for many years. However, prior research has not described a way to empirically determine whether, and to what extent, students experience intellectual need. In this paper, we present a methodology for identifying students’ intellectual need and report the results of a study that investigated students’ reactions to intellectual need-provoking tasks in first-semester calculus classes. We also explore the relationship between intellectual need, affective need, and students’ learning. Although the overall percentage of students who reported experiencing an intellectual need was low, we found positive associations between intellectual need and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sites of Educational Conflict</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Books for and in schools are commodities. They form a central part of the political economy of publishing. They are also, profoundly, sites of cultural and ideological conflict. While always there, there are periods when these economic and ideological conflicts are even more powerful. This is just such a time. This reality asks us to also examine places in school buildings that might (often wrongly) seem to some people to be “less important.” Among these places is the school library as a resource, a teaching device, an access point to things seen as controversial, a mirror of conflicts and economic and political transformations, and for many students, at times a sanctuary. American Public School Librarianship: A History provides us with a richly sourced account of the development of a key pedagogic site in schools and of many of the personal, institutional, and political reasons why they do—and do not do—certain things.

        <title>Algebraic reasoning in years 5 and 6: classifying its emergence and progression using reverse fraction tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper builds on our previous research and investigates how students’ fractional competence and reasoning can provide clear evidence of non-symbolic algebraic thinking and its progressive transition towards fully generalised algebraic thinking. In a large-scale study, 470 primary students completed a written paper and pencil test. This included three reverse fraction tasks which required students to find an unknown whole when presented with a quantity representing a fraction of that whole. Seventeen students from one participating primary school undertook a semi-structured interview which included reverse fraction tasks, similar to those on the written test, but with progressive levels of abstraction, starting with particular instances and becoming more generalised. Two important products of the study are the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Classification Framework for Reverse Fraction Tasks&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emerging Algebraic Reasoning Framework&lt;/em&gt;. The interview results highlight two critical transition points for the emergence of students’ algebraic reasoning. The first is the ability to transition from additive strategies to multiplicative strategies to solve reverse fraction problems. Students reliant on diagrams and additive strategies struggled to solve more generalised tasks that required multiplicative rather than additive strategies. The second transition is the shift from multiplicative thinking to algebraic reasoning where students could generalise their multiplicative knowledge to deal with any quantity represented in a reverse fraction task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Situating Expectancies and Subjective Task Values Across Grade Levels, Domains, and Countries: A Network Approach</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;In their recently renamed theory, situated expectancy-value theory (SEVT), Eccles and Wigfield (2020) emphasized the importance of situations in influencing individuals’ motivational beliefs and academic choices. Adopting a novel approach—network analysis—this study aimed to examine how situations may impact the associations among expectancies, subjective task values, and achievement from a holistic perspective. In this study, situations were operationalized as grade levels (i.e., 6th –9th grade), subject domains (i.e., language arts and math), and countries (i.e., Finland and Germany). Adolescents from Finland (N = 4,062) and Germany (N = 449) were included in the study. Results showed that, overall, the networks are mostly subject bound, yearly varied, and country specific, supporting the situative nature of SEVT. We also found that expectancies were consistently the closest motivational beliefs to achievement, whereas utility values were the least close, implying that expectancies, not utility, might be the most desirable intervention targets for achievement improvement.

        <title>Understanding the Evolution of Environment, Social and Governance Research: Novel Implications From Bibliometric and Network Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Given the scarcity of comprehensive review studies in the literature, this bibliometric analysis thrives on taking a scientific approach to delivering quantitative and qualitative information on the ever-evolving field of ESG. Utilizing the performance analysis and science mapping techniques which includes citation analysis, co-word analysis, the study reports a holistic overview of 693 (ESG) papers from 1991 to 2020. The paper aims to provide a unified perspective on the evolution and further identify future research directions in this field. The findings point to the most important countries, authors, studies, and top journals in this field. Results show that published articles on ESG gained momentum after 2006; however, an exponential rise is being observed in the past 5 years, with research focusing on sustainable finance, sustainable development, ESG, and CSR with themes extending to risk management, stakeholder engagement, and portfolio construction, among others. Furthermore, the research identifies how the practice of ESG reporting affects many variables such as financial performance, social performance, environmental performance, and sustainability score. The findings also indicate that the field of ESG is still evolving, with numerous unexplored themes. The work is novel and relevant on the pretext that it uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases for bibliometric mapping, whereas previous studies have used the Scopus database but have lacked a robust methodology, so the findings of this study provided strong support for identifying emerging paradigms in the ESG literature.

        <title>Can Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions Provide Unbiased Effect Estimates? A Systematic Review of Internal Replication Studies</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Background: Non-randomized studies of intervention effects (NRS), also called quasi-experiments, provide useful decision support about development impacts. However, the assumptions underpinning them are usually untestable, their verification resting on empirical replication. The internal replication study aims to do this by comparing results from a causal benchmark study, usually a randomized controlled trial (RCT), with those from an NRS conducted at the same time in the sampled population. Objectives: We aimed to determine the credibility and generalizability of findings in internal replication studies in development economics, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Research Design: We systematically searched for internal replication studies of RCTs conducted on socioeconomic interventions in low- and middle-income countries. We critically appraised the benchmark randomized studies, using an adapted tool. We extracted and statistically synthesized empirical measures of bias. Results: We included 600 estimates of correspondence between NRS and benchmark RCTs. All internal replication studies were found to have at least “some concerns” about bias and some had high risk of bias. We found that study designs with selection on unobservables, in particular regression discontinuity, on average produced absolute standardized bias estimates that were approximately zero, that is, equivalent to the estimates produced by RCTs. But study conduct also mattered. For example, matching using pre-tests and nearest neighbor algorithms corresponded more closely to the benchmarks. Conclusions: The findings from this systematic review confirm that NRS can produce unbiased estimates. Authors of internal replication studies should publish pre-analysis protocols to enhance their credibility.

        <title>A Consideration of Alternative Sample Spaces Used in Coin-Toss Problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper examines coin-toss comparison questions from two recent studies involving undergraduate students and high school teachers and connects to findings from two prior studies in the literature. Considering possible sample spaces employed by participants, this is a reflection on whether one sequence could be more likely depending on the interpretation of the question. To critique the choice of sequences and determine possible scenarios in which one sequence may be more likely than the other, three alternative sample spaces were explored. It was determined that different sample spaces can lead to one sequence being more likely to occur than the other. Further evaluation discusses whether alternative sample spaces may have been utilised by the participants in each of the studies, and hence, the paper concludes with an advocacy to enquire deeper into participants’ reasoning when investigating coin-toss questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2020 Rossi Award Lecture: The Evolving Art of Program Evaluation</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Background: Evaluation of public programs has undergone many changes over the past four decades since Peter Rossi coined his “Iron Law” of program evaluation: “The expected value of any net impact assessment of any large-scale social program is zero.” While that assessment may be somewhat overstated, the essence still holds. The failures far outnumber the successes, and the estimated favorable effects are rarely sizeable. Findings: Despite this grim assessment, much can be learned from “failed” experiments, and from ones that are successful in only some sites or subgroups. Advances in study design, statistical models, data, and how inferences are drawn from estimates have substantially improved our analyses and will continue to do so. However, the most actual learning about “what works” (and why, when, and where) is likely to come from gathering more detailed and comprehensive data on how the intervention was implemented and attempting to link that data to estimated impacts. Researchers need detailed data on the target population served, the content of the intervention, and the process by which it is delivered to participating service providers and individuals. Two examples presented here illustrate how researchers drew useful broader lessons from impact estimates for a set of related programs. Conclusion: Rossi posited three reasons most interventions fail—wrong question, wrong intervention, poor implementation. Speeding the accumulation of wisdom about how social programs can best help vulnerable populations will require that researchers work closely with program funders, developers, operators, and participants to gather and interpret these detailed data about program implementation.

        <title>Round and Round They Go: The Relationship Between Changing Grades and Schools and Teacher Quality and Absence Rates</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Research on teacher churn has produced conflicting conclusions as to its impact on students and teachers. We bring clarity to this work by combining and expanding on analytical approaches used in earlier research to determine how and when different types of churn (i.e., grade, school) impact teacher effectiveness and attendance. Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, our results suggest differences based on analytical approach but ultimately show that changing schools and grades may be less of an issue than previously reported. In addition, in the case of school churn, a beneficial match in their new school sites may matter more for teacher outcomes than potential disruptive effects of churn. We conclude with implications for policy and future research.

        <title>Growth mindset &amp; intellectual risk-taking: Disentangling conflated concepts</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-55, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Although most teachers are familiar with growth mindsets, many conflate it with other terms or concepts or have difficulties understanding how to best foster growth mindsets in their students. Shelby Clark and Madora Soutter describe how growth mindsets are related to, yet distinct from, intellectual risk-taking and share strategies for fostering both in students. The strategies come from their yearlong research project observing classes and interviewing students and teachers at a high school that uses a discussion-based pedagogy known as the Harkness method.

When Nathan was overwhelmed, Carmen Torres, a bilingual science teacher, reassured her and became a model for how to lead her classroom. When Carmen died in April 2022, Nathan shared her story with other teachers and school leaders who have been inspired both to consider who their Carmens have been and to be Carmens for new teachers in their schools.

        <title>On Leadership: A solid transition process helps new leaders chart a clear course forward</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-59, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; As new school leaders take over the district’s top jobs this fall, they and their communities face transitions. Joshua P. Starr explains that too many leaders focus on entry and fail to engage in a thoughtful and comprehensive transition process. Transition isn’t just about change; it’s also about loss. Organizational transition is about how people respond to these changed circumstances. Even if people are ready and eager to embrace the new beginning, they still lose their old way of doing business. For those who resist the new or are just unsure of what it means for them, their sense of loss can manifest in active opposition to a leader’s new ideas. A good transition process involves the creation of a transition team with committees made up of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and community members, who will be more likely to support plans that come from their work.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Defying the gravitational pull of education politics</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; The biggest threat to an equitable and prosperous American society is not a particular educational policy, but the gravitational pull of politics, explains Jonathan Collins. Before educational policy can be developed and put into place, the politics that drive education must be acknowledged and addressed. Violence is erupting at school board meetings across the country over mask mandates, book bans, and critical race theory. Meanwhile, as has been the case throughout U.S. history, the political division and vitriol distract us from ensuring that our most vulnerable children are getting needed academic support. It is time, Collins says, for a politics of solutions that can defy the gravitational pull of politics that sidetrack leaders addressing the real problems students face.

        <title>Under the Law: Public schools, religion, and equality after Carson v. Makin</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-61, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; In Carson v. Makin, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, if a state offers tuition assistance for students to attend private schools, then requiring that those private schools be nonsectarian violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Robert Kim discusses how this case aligns with other decisions related to the free exercise of religion as it applies to public schools and what it could mean for schools going forward. Carson v. Makin, he explains, is one of several cases that open the door for states to fund religious education. At the same time, recent cases show that these schools may be allowed to discriminate against students and teachers while continuing to receive state funds.

        <title>Backtalk: Let’s take another look at homework</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Veteran teacher Katherine A. James responds to a March 2022 Kappan article in which high school student Colin McGrath warned his younger brother of the burden that pointless homework assignments will play in his life when he enters high school. James suggests that, although some teachers may assign work with little value, most assignments do serve to either reinforce or expand on what students have learned in class. She urges teachers and students to think of homework as opportunities for learning at home. Ideally, teachers will explain the purpose of any at-home learning and give students options for engaging in such learning, using their individual intelligences to master the content.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/1&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, September 2022. &lt;br/&gt; Teaching is a difficult job even in the best of circumstances, and recent years have been far from the best circumstances, explains Teresa Preston, editor-in-chief of Kappan. The COVID-19 pandemic has created situations where all the decisions educators make are fraught, and unhappy members of the public have been quick to air their frustrations, even as the PDK Poll indicates that the public is more satisfied with local schools than ever. The September 2022 issue of Kappan explores the circumstances making education especially challenging and suggests solutions.
