        <title>Approaches to Integration Based on Quantitative Reasoning: Adding Up Pieces and Accumulation from Rate</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Calculus education research on integration is coalescing around the theme that teaching integration based on quantitative reasoning is crucial for robust understanding of and usage of integrals. This paper contributes to this International Journal for Research in Undergraduate Education special issue on the teaching and learning of definite integrals by reviewing the research literature on quantitatively-based approaches to integration, in order to pull together the ideas that are spread across many papers in many outlets. We note that the literature in this area has largely developed along two distinct paradigms, which we call &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;adding up pieces&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;accumulation from rate&lt;/em&gt;. While they are both based in quantitative reasoning, there are critical differences between them that have important ramifications for teaching and learning integration. We use these two paradigms to organize our review and we use the literature to discuss the meanings, formalizations, foci, reasoning, and modeling in these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Autoethnographic engagement in participatory action research: Bearing witness to developmental transformations for college student activists</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article documents and analyzes autoethnographic engagement in participatory action research (PAR)—a reflective, irritative, and dialogic writing and team-discussion process which documents researcher-activist experiences and contextualizes them within the action research process. We document autoethnography as implemented in a research partnership between HMoob American college student activists and education researchers, to study the systems of oppression and inform advocacy to support HMoob American students at a predominantly white university. Autoethnography informs all aspects of the PAR project, from the development of research questions, to data collection, analysis, and writing, to the implementation of plans for action. We provide evidence from selections of the team’s autoethnographic journals, of the role of autoethnographic engagement as a PAR research technique that can facilitate and bear witness to the developmental transformations for emerging PAR activists—specifically, the cultivation of critical consciousness, the critical re-framing of issues of cultural-community identity, and the formation of an identity as a researcher-activist. We argue that autoethnography provides a practical technique for PAR teams for engaging in iterative cycles of critical self-reflective praxis (Freire, 2011), facilitating the development of critically-engaged researchers and the formation of analyses that are epistemologically grounded and action-oriented, addressing issues of power asymmetries within research.

        <title>Teacher Attrition and Mobility in the Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We contextualize the magnitude of teacher attrition during the pandemic, including from the 2020–2021 school year to the 2021–2022 school year, using longitudinal data on teachers in Washington since the 1984–1985 school year. The teacher attrition rate after the 2020–2021 school year (7.3%) increased by almost one percentage point from the attrition rate after the 2019–2020 school year (6.4%), but these rates are well within the range of turnover rates observed during pre-pandemic years. The increase in turnover during the pandemic was also smaller than pre-pandemic differences in turnover between high- and low-poverty classrooms in the state, and these inequities in turnover between high- and low-poverty classrooms decreased during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic years.

        <title>Computational thinking practices as tools for creating high cognitive demand mathematics instruction</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;One characteristic of high-quality mathematics teaching is supporting students in engaging in tasks of high cognitive demand. In this paper, we explore relationships between two elementary teachers’ efforts to integrate computational thinking (CT) practices—abstraction, debugging, and decomposition—into their mathematics instruction and their development of high-level tasks. Teachers engaged in professional development sessions about CT. Using their mathematics curriculum materials as a starting point, teachers then planned mathematics lessons to incorporate attention to at least one CT practice. Researchers transcribed their conversations and qualitatively coded the transcripts using an established framework for assessing the cognitive demand of tasks posed to students. Analyses of the planning conversations suggested that encouraging these teachers to examine their mathematics curriculum materials through the lens of CT practices supported them in adapting tasks from their curriculum materials in ways that raised the cognitive demand. Implications for the use of CT in elementary mathematics teacher education are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is It in the Cards?! A Definite Work in Progress</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A number of memorable tasks have been revealed through collegial exchanges with underlying philosophical, theoretical, and potentially nefarious motivations. Such was the origin of the probability problem, and the various differences of opinion, presented herein. This article recounts how, together, we explored and disputed the probabilities stemming from a simple standard deck of cards sitting on a table. We have had moments of consensus spiralling into low-points of discontent and back again, as our actions and reactions created intriguing, yet disconcerting, insights, questions, and consequences. Opposing arguments that emerged from this exploration are presented here in hopes of arriving at a single answer, but maybe, just maybe, even consensus is not in the cards.

        <title>Is Teacher Effectiveness Stable Across School Contexts? An Examination of Teachers Who Transfer Into Turnaround Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Turnaround interventions often require or encourage low-performing schools to replace teachers, assuming that schools will recruit high-performing teachers who remain effective after transferring. However, teacher effectiveness may change after transferring, which could explain why some teacher replacement efforts do not improve student achievement. This paper contributes new information on the stability of teacher effectiveness by examining teachers who transfer into turnaround schools relative to teachers who transfer into low-performing but non-turnaround schools. I examine this issue by using two turnaround models in Tennessee, one with documented positive effects and one producing no effects on student achievement. I find that teacher effectiveness increases after transferring into the model that produced positive effects and either decreases or stays the same after transferring into the model that did not improve student achievement. These findings suggest that heterogeneity in turnaround effects may be partly explained by changes in teacher effectiveness after they transfer into turnaround schools.

        <title>Black, Indigenous, People of Color and Feelings of Safety in School: Decomposing Variation and Ecological Assets</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Feeling unsafe at school undermines student well-being and educational outcomes. Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) might feel less safe at school due to attending systemically inequitable schools and discriminatory treatment. This QuantCrit study examines two facets of this inequality of opportunity: factors explaining differing rates of feeling unsafe and ecological assets of BIPOC students. Methods include decomposition to understand differences in feelings of safety and structural equation modeling to examine relationships between safety, ecological assets, and subsequent outcomes, using data from two nationally represented, longitudinal data sets. We find that BIPOC students felt less safe at school than did White students, and these differences are more attributable to variation between schools for Black students and within-school differences for Hispanic and American Indian students. The association between feeling unsafe and early adulthood socioeconomic status was fully mediated by ecological assets for Black and Hispanic students, but only partially mediated for White students.

        <title>Performance or Progress? The Physical and Rhetorical Removal of Indigenous Peoples in Settler Land Acknowledgments at Land-Grab Universities</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Land acknowledgments are an evolving practice to recognize local Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of their homelands. Using a content and discourse analysis, we conduct the first empirical study of U.S. land acknowledgment statements focusing on the 47 land-grab universities created under the 1862 Morrill Act. We find that LGUs tend to adopt statements in urban areas, where federally recognized tribes are present, and at institutions with over 100 enrolled Native American students. Land acknowledgment statements also commonly name local Indigenous Peoples yet often fail to articulate their responsibilities to them, include superficial gestures, and center multicultural language. We offer “rhetorical removal” to describe the tendency of land-grab universities to deploy language that selectively erases Indigenous Peoples and, thus, argue that statements must directly address settler colonial legacies of violence and redistribute material support for Indigenous students and partnerships with Native nations.

        <title>Computational Strategies and Estimation Performance With Bayesian Semiparametric Item Response Theory Models</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This article provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of DPMs. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.

        <title>Narrative characteristics of captivating secondary mathematics lessons</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Why do some mathematics lessons captivate high school students and others not? This study explores this question by comparing how the content unfolds in the lessons that students rated highest with respect to their aesthetic affordances (e.g., using terms like “intriguing,” “surprising”) with those the same students rated lowest with respect to their aesthetic affordances (e.g., “just ok,” “dull”). Using a framework that interprets the unfolding content across a lesson as a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;mathematical story&lt;/em&gt;, we examine how some lessons can provoke curiosity or enable surprise. We identify eight characteristics that distinguish captivating lessons and show how some, such as the average number of questions under consideration at any point in the lesson, are strongly related to student aesthetic experiences. In addition, the lessons that students described as more interesting included more instances of misdirection, such as when students’ false assumptions provide opportunities for surprising results. These findings point to the characteristics of future lesson designs that could enable more students to experience curiosity and wonder in secondary mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecting algorithmics to mathematics learning: a design study of the intermediate value theorem and the bisection algorithm</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Programming-based activities are becoming more widespread in curricula. Our theoretical and empirical investigation seeks to identify appropriate ways to connect computer programming and algorithmics to mathematical learning. We take the intermediate value theorem as our starting point, as it is covered by the French school curriculum, and because of its links with the bisection algorithm. We build upon the theory of mathematical working spaces, distinguishing between algorithmic and mathematical working spaces. Both working spaces are explored from the semiotic, instrumental, and discursive dimensions that support learning. Our two research questions focus on the suitable algorithmic and mathematical working spaces in which students develop an understanding of the intermediate value theorem, and the bisection algorithm. Our method starts at the reference level, with an epistemological and curricular analysis. Then, a series of tasks is designed for students working in adidacticity, and suitable working spaces are determined a priori. The tasks have been implemented in French classrooms with students aged 16–19. An analysis of their work supports an a posteriori examination of the working spaces. Our findings demonstrate that the students were able to make connections between algorithmics and mathematics in each of the three dimensions, semiotic, instrumental, and discursive, and point out the interplay between these dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Culturally Relevant Pedagogies (CRP) and Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT) in Science Education: Black Success Stories in Ontario</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The continued underrepresentation of Black students in science education in Ontario has highlighted issues of social justice within the province, and the ways in which this impacts minoritized groups, curriculum design, and teacher education. Critics of a post-colonial education system that reinforces existing biases against certain groups have pointed to culturally relevant and culturally responsive pedagogies for enhanced student success. The lack of attention to Black history, experiences, and perspectives in science has resulted in the needs of Black student populations being underserved. This small-scale qualitative study examines the self-reported pedagogies of three purposefully selected, successful science teachers, effectively utilizing culturally relevant and responsive pedagogies to improve Black student engagement and achievement in Ontario classrooms. Responses from participants recorded via Zoom using in-depth semi-structured interview protocols, along with additional notes taken in informal conversations, were inductively and deductively analysed. Three major themes emerged: successful teachers of Black students practice inclusion by incorporating Black references and experiences in classroom teachings, actively work to build empowering relationships with students and their caregivers, and are life-long learners, motivated and committed to supporting the academic, social, and cultural needs of their students. In addition, our findings suggest that science teachers, regardless of race, can promote Black student success through being critically reflexive practitioners and adopting culturally responsive strategies. As a result, these success stories can inform broader school administration policy regarding diverse student populations, and improve science teacher preparation and education programmes in Ontario and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;To assess the elements necessary to be a successful learning community (ClinCalc) mentor to medical students from the mentee’s perspective. Few such studies have utilized the in-depth and richness of detail obtained in qualitative studies. This qualitative study analyzed four focus group discussions lasting 45–90 min conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, which has an established LC, in the year 2018. The groups included 14 pre-clerkship and 8 clerkship students. Investigators evaluated transcriptions of the focus group discussions using ATLAS.ti software. Three overarching categories of discussion emerged from the group discussions: (1) Relationship Competence, (2) Teaching Competence, and (3) Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence. Relationship Competence themes included “walk with me,” relationship is most important, and one-on-one. Teaching Competence themes included above and beyond, recognize and address mentor limitations, and safe and enriching environment. Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence themes included ethical decision making and compassionate care for diverse patient populations. Mentees focused on various aspects of the mentor-mentee relationship as the single most essential competence. Themes mentees discussed as important qualities of a successful mentor may denote qualities to be prioritized in faculty development and mentor recruitment. Future studies could investigate how the LC environment informs former medical students and promotes patient outcomes.

        <title>Keeping pace with innovations in data visualizations: A commentary for mathematics education in times of crisis</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mathematical medium of data visualization and other data representations (DV) has served as a primary means of communicating about the COVID-19 crisis. DVs about the pandemic are highly visible across news journalism and include an increasingly innovative and diverse set of representational forms. These representational forms employ multimodal, interactive, and narrative elements, among others, that create new possibilities for data storytelling. Building on current efforts to expand the teaching and learning of data practices in K-12 mathematics education, we argue that innovative DVs create new opportunities for teaching and learning mathematics, particularly during times of crisis. We illustrate our argument using three examples of innovative DVs from news journalism. We discuss how these DVs could serve as complementary resources alongside conventional graphs to support students as they use mathematics and mathematical representations to make sense of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our commentary seeks to bring current trends in data representation to bear in mathematics education. Leveraging such trends offers artifacts useful for teaching and opens up space for elevating emotion and experience as important aspects of mathematics curricula.&lt;/p&gt;
