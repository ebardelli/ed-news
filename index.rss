        <title>Advancing “Intersectional Servingness” in Research, Practice, and Policy With Hispanic-Serving Institutions</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;There has been a surge in the number of Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), which are degree-granting, nonprofit, postsecondary institutions that enroll at least 25% Hispanic/Latinx/e undergraduate students. Although HSI scholarship has increased dramatically since around 2010, there is still a gap in knowledge about individuals who fall within the “H” and the diversity among HSIs themselves. Using critical theory and critical methods, the articles in this special topic collection explore the complexities of the Hispanic/Latinx/e identity and the various ways that HSIs fall short of and meet the challenges of serving students at the intersections of identity. This introduction provides a brief overview of the eight articles in this collection and explains the need for this critical approach to HSI scholarship, which we call “intersectional servingness.” We outline the contributions of these eight articles and call on practitioners, scholars, policy intermediaries, funders, and federal agencies to consider the complexities of the “H” while making decisions, advancing research, implementing policies, and creating funding streams that will enhance intersectional servingness.

        <title>What Schools Do Families Want (and Why)? Evidence on Revealed Preferences From New Orleans</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Prior research suggests that families prefer schools with higher test scores, shorter distances from home, and certain student demographics. We build on this using data from New Orleans, a context well suited to identification of parent preferences because of its deferred acceptance algorithm and extensive, standardized, and broadly accessible school information. This allows us to study revealed preferences for a richer set of characteristics. We find that families prefer schools with higher school value-added, more extracurricular activities, and after-school childcare. We also find heterogeneity by family income that is more consistent with income constraints than preference heterogeneity. Finally, we show how methodology and data shape the results.

        <title>Unpacking the Relationship Between Classroom Teacher Characteristics and Time to English Learner Reclassification</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Reclassification is a crucial outcome for English learner (EL) students’ academic progress. Though ELs spend a large portion of their academic time with general education teachers, we know little about the role general education teachers play in developing ELs’ English language proficiency. Drawing from a longitudinal administrative dataset from Tennessee, this study uses discrete-time survival analysis to estimate the relationship between ELs’ likelihood of reclassification and characteristics of their general education English language arts (ELA) teachers in Grades 3–8. The study finds that several measures of teacher effectiveness consistently predict EL reclassification. Sensitivity and robustness checks substantiate these relationships. Findings have important policy implications for the identification and assignment of ELs to effective general education ELA teachers.

        <title>The Relationship Between Varying Levels of Online Enrollment and Degree Completion</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines the influence of varying levels of online enrollment on community college students’ likelihood of degree completion, with a particular focus on completion outcomes among traditionally underserved subgroups of students. Using institutional transcript data from a high-enrollment community college and a propensity score weighting approach, I find that lower levels of online enrollment have a positive relationship with the likelihood of degree completion for Black, Hispanic, and low-income community college students, but enrolling in all online courses has a negative influence on the likelihood of degree completion across subgroups of community college students.

        <title>Boys’ motivation profiles in mathematics: relations with contextual factors, wellbeing and engagement in a boys-only school</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examined the extent to which boys fell into clusters comprised of different levels of motivations and costs. In turn, the antecedents of these clusters and associations with engagement and wellbeing outcomes were considered. Based on survey responses from 168 students across Years 5, 7 and 9 from an all-boys&#39; school in Sydney, Australia, three clusters were identified: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Positively Engaged, Disengaged&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Struggling Ambitious&lt;/em&gt;. Performance-approach and avoidance achievement goals, mastery classroom goal structure, perceived peer valuing of mathematics and teacher enthusiasm differentially predicted profile membership. Clusters were also found to differ in terms of both wellbeing and engagement, such that students within maladaptive profiles evidenced the most negative outcomes. The study reaffirms prior work, holds implications for addressing student motivation in mathematics, and adds to understanding of the interplay of individual and classroom goal structures in relation to students’ mathematics expectancies, values and resultant outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emotions and motivation in mathematics education: Where we are today and where we need to go</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emotions and motivation are important for learning and achievement in mathematics. In this paper, we present an overview of research on students’ emotions and motivation in mathematics. First, we briefly review how early research has developed into the current state-of-the-art and outline the following key characteristics of emotions and motivation: objects, valence, temporal stability (vs. variability), and situational specificity (vs. generality). Second, we summarize major theories in the field (the control-value theory of achievement emotions, expectancy-value theory of achievement-related motivation, self-determination theory of human motivation, and social-cognitive theory of self-efficacy). Third, we present an overview of instructional characteristics that have been shown to foster emotions and motivation. Fourth, we provide an overview of the contributions to the special issue on “Emotions and Motivation in Mathematics Education and Educational Psychology.” Finally, we suggest directions for future research in the field with respect to advancing theory, improving measurement, and considering diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sourcing mathematical meaning as a dialogic process: meaning-focused and language-focused repairs</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I report the results of an analysis of an episode of elementary school second language mathematics classroom talk focused on the classification of geometric forms, drawing on a dialogic, sources of meaning perspective. The episode was selected 
      because participants make use of a variety of features of language, including vocabulary, gestures and diagrams. The analysis drew on methods and principles from conversation analysis and revealed that interactional repair was a key feature in the organisation of the episode. Repair sequences are stretches of interaction in which participants deal with explicitly signalled ‘trouble’ in participants’ working assumption of shared understanding. The results include a distinction between meaning-focused and language-focused repair, with some repair sequences embedded within others. This layered organisation is important in the emergence of meaning for participants’ utterances and mediates the tension between centripetal and centrifugal language forces. The findings highlight the complexity of mathematics classroom interaction and suggest possibilities for the careful management of focusing on language and on mathematical meaning in classroom interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The integration of undergraduate students’ informal and formal inferential reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Since statistical inference is a probabilistic generalization about a population analyzed on the basis of a sample, inferential reasoning demands producing reasons (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;statistical&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;contextual&lt;/em&gt;) to substantiate and validate generalizations. To convey an understanding of students’ inferential reasoning, we present a proposal—based on Toulmin’s argumentation model—in which the production of statistical and contextual reasons serve as fundamental components of students’ inferential reasoning by providing supporting arguments that can be expressed as a sequence of statements. We analyze the inferential reasoning of university students asked to work in teams on an inferential activity in the context of environmental pollution. Results show that they integrated informal and formal methods to produce statistical reasons, complemented by contextual reasons to support their conclusions. Their reasoning model allowed us to identify (a) a potential transition from informal to formal inferential reasoning; and (b) ambiguity, or an absence of expressions of uncertainty, about generalizations regarding the population, possibly related to their confidence in using formal methods (e.g., hypothesis testing). We conclude that our proposal helps encourage and analyze students’ inferential reasoning. Future research will require clearer definitions of the characteristics of the argumentation model in the field of statistical inferential reasoning because arguments depend on their disciplinary context.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning Math Through Coding and Learning Coding Through Math: Two Sides of the Same Coin</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The integration of coding in K-12 mathematics education is occurring throughout jurisdictions around the world. Best practices for applying coding practices in teaching mathematics are gaining research attention, and teacher education programmes are increasingly offering professional development to support this initiative. This paper discusses strategies and lessons learned over a 5-year period of developing and offering mandatory coding education as part of mathematics teacher preparation. We identify some of the requisite knowledge and experiences needed in order to overcome coding anxiety and begin to adopt coding as part of mathematics teaching practice. In particular, we discuss a distinction between &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;learning coding through mathematics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;learning mathematics through coding&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some mathematicians’ perceived and envisioned instructional relationships in secondary teaching and teaching secondary teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When it comes to content courses for prospective secondary teachers, mathematics faculty’s intentions conflict with teachers’ experiences: while faculty aim to influence teachers’ future teaching, many teachers find these courses irrelevant to teaching. In this study, we investigate mathematics faculty’s goals for content courses for prospective secondary teachers and how these goals connect to their vision of secondary teaching. This study makes two contributions. First, drawing on data from an interview study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5) of faculty who have taught secondary teachers, we articulate these mathematicians’ rationales with respect to teaching secondary teachers, particularly in capstone courses. Second, we contribute a conceptual framework that supports inferences about connections between content course activities and instructors’ beliefs about secondary teaching. We conclude by suggesting that the dual triad that depicts our framework may support professional development and programmatic design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uneven Progress: Recent Trends in Academic Performance Among U.S. School Districts</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We use data from the Stanford Education Data Archive to describe district-level trends in average academic achievement between 2009 and 2019. Although on average school districts’ test scores improved very modestly (by about 0.001 standard deviations per year), there is significant variation among districts. Moreover, we find that average test score disparities between nonpoor and poor students and between White and Black students are growing; those between White and Hispanic students are shrinking. We find no evidence of achievement-equity synergies or trade-offs: Improvements in overall achievement are uncorrelated with trends in achievement disparities. Finally, we find that the strongest predictors of achievement disparity trends are the levels and trends in within-district racial and socioeconomic segregation and changes in differential access to certified teachers.

        <title>Underrepresented Minority Students in College: The Role of Classmates</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The role of racial diversity at colleges has been debated for over more than a half a century with limited quasi-experimental evidence from classrooms. To fill this void, I estimate the extent that classmate racial compositions affect Hispanic and African American students at a large and oversubscribed California community college where they are minorities. I find that when minority students are exposed to a greater share of same-race classmates, they are more likely to complete the class with a pass and are more likely to enroll in a same-subject course the subsequent term. The findings are robust to first-time students with the lowest registration priority versus all students and different combinations of fixed effects (e.g., student, class, and instructor race).

        <title>The reciprocal relationship among Chinese senior secondary students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and cognitive engagement in learning mathematics: a three-wave longitudinal study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the present longitudinal study, cross-lagged path models were applied to investigate the potential reciprocal relationships between senior secondary school students’ motivation and their cognitive engagement, using data from 623 Chinese senior secondary school students across 2 years. The 623 students completed self-reported measures of motivation and engagement at three time points within 2 years. The results suggest that the participants held a mixed type of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to learn mathematics and did not hold a deep level of cognitive engagement in mathematics learning. Compared with their extrinisic motivation, their intrinsic motivation to learn mathematics was more closely related to their cognitive engagement in mathematics learning, which points to a stronger reciprocal effect between their cognitive engagement and intrinsic motivation. The findings suggest that societal and cultural factors, such as the strong examination culture and high external expectations might be influential factors affecting the reciprocal relationships among students’ motivation and cognitive engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics-specific learning difficulties and disabilities (MLD) have received increasing attention in scholarly research. In this study, we place MLD research in its wider context of risk societies by discussing the manufacturing of MLD as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a risk&lt;/em&gt;. This framing of MLD builds on a certain idea of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; in how research could provide the means to better understand and support learners with MLD. We conduct a Foucault-informed analysis to understand how scholarly knowledge about MLD has been produced through discourses of risk and hope. Our material consists of 30 influential journal articles published in the three fields of MLD research: cognitive sciences, special education and mathematics education. Our study indicates that MLD has been predominantly conceptualised through a technico-scientific risk discourse that frames MLD as harmful for learners and societies alike; such risk discourse relies on a discourse of hope in scientific methods. We also analyse a social risk discourse that identifies risks in social exclusion and marginalisation of students with MLD, finding hope in inclusive learning environments. Based on our analysis, we propose that the mere conceptualisation of MLD has thoroughly revolved around discourses of current liminalities (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt;) and enunciations of better futures (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;). However, what has been unexplored is the politics of such risk and hope discourses themselves. We propose a socio-politically oriented discourse of risk/hope as a way to reframe scientific knowledge production about MLD. This discourse identifies risks not in MLD itself but in how research manufactures MLD as a threat to both economic growth and student identities. Instead of asking research communities to mitigate the risk of MLD, we call for them to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Complex Mathematics Education: An Integrated and Inquiry-Based Mathematics Teaching Method</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Little is available in mathematics education research about what the teacher can anticipate from the students when applying inquiry-based learning (IBL). Even less is known about how to recognize and exploit on the spot when a mathematical domain, other than the one in focus, is activated in the students’ minds. Yet, in tests, in everyday life, and  the labour market, it is common to face problems that require interrelated mathematical thinking. Although one of the unique advantages of complex mathematics education (CME) is the coherence between different domains and CME has been practiced for over half a century in Hungary, the Hungarian line of IBL has only recently joined the international methodological mainstream. In this paper, I summarize a segment of IBL correspondent to CME and integrated mathematics education, and I illustrate the possible divergence of solutions during implementation with an example that emerged about a probability game in a fifth-grade class.&lt;/p&gt;
