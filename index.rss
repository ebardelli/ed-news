        <title>Epistemic injustice and dissidence: A bibliometric analysis of the literature on Participatory Action Research hosted on the Web of Science</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;For decades, Participatory Action Research (PAR) has been extended as a scientific praxis applied in different contexts, characterised by the involvement of participating groups and oriented towards social transformation. However, there is a certain dialectical tension between those approaches that emphasise the method versus those that emphasise the pursuit of social change from a decolonial perspective. This article questions how this praxis is reflected in scientific transfer, analysing not only the development and scope of scientific production in PAR, but also how the academy may reproduce relations inherent to coloniality in this transfer. To this end, the production on PAR hosted on the Web of Science (WoS) is collected, and a bibliometric analysis is performed by applying descriptive and relational techniques using VosViewer software. The study concludes that scientific production has not stopped growing and that the areas of knowledge where it is applied have diversified. However, it also points out how the knowledge production model reproduces the power relations of coloniality, affecting PAR’s transfer. This analysis can contribute to the debate on a scientific approach oriented to improve processes of social transformation.

        <title>From mistakes, we learn? Mathematics teachers’ epistemological and positional framing of mistakes</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This interpretive cross-case study investigates complexity in the ways teachers frame mistakes and the reasons behind their framing, challenging the assumption in the literature that productive beliefs about errors generate productive error-handling practices, while unproductive beliefs result in unproductive practices. The study draws on interviews and classroom observations with three secondary mathematics teachers who were selected using purposive sampling. Analysis examines how the teachers framed mistakes in their classroom practice and the instructional moves that enacted each frame. We paid particular attention to epistemological frames&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which concern the value of mistakes in the construction of mathematical knowledge, and positional frames&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which concern the roles that students are authorized or obligated to take to address errors, researching how teachers’ epistemological and positional framing of errors were related. The results suggest that teachers invoked four primary frames related to errors: a epistemological frame of errors-as-resources, a positional frame of students-as-capable&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; an epistemological frame of errors-as-deficiencies, and an positional frame of students-as-incapable. We discuss barriers to using mistakes as resources for learning and implications for mathematics teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The role of epistemic emotions in undergraduate students’ proof construction</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Proofs as epistemic tools are central to mathematical practice, as they establish and provide explanations for the validity of mathematical statements. Considering the challenge that proof construction poses to learners of all ages, prior research has investigated its cognitive determinants, but the impact of affective-motivational experiences on proof construction has been insufficiently investigated. Emotions related to knowledge acquisition (i.e., epistemic emotions) are assumed to play a key role in epistemic processes. In this study we investigated how the performance of 80 mathematics undergraduate students in a geometric proof construction task relates to the epistemic emotions experienced during proof construction. Controlling for geometry knowledge, we included control and value appraisals as antecedents in our investigation of epistemic emotions, and attention and motivation as mediators of their effects on proof construction performance. The results indicate that positive as well as negative emotions are influenced by students’ appraisals, also indicating an interaction of both appraisal dimensions. Primarily enjoyment and curiosity mediate the effects of these appraisals on attention and motivation. These two markers of the proof construction process, in turn, mediate the effects of enjoyment and boredom on proof construction performance. In this study we investigated systematically the role of epistemic emotions in geometric proof construction and we offer insights that complement the existing research on the cognitive determinants of proof performance. Moreover, this study extended research on epistemic emotions into the area of proof construction, an epistemic process central to mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The servants of two discourses: how novice facilitators draw on their mathematics teaching experience</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Professional development (PD) courses are the main context for mathematics teachers’ lifelong learning. Leaders with expertise are needed to facilitate these courses; thus, there is a growing interest in understanding the nature of this profession, its core practices, and the challenges it entails. This paper focuses on a specific group of facilitators: experienced mathematics teachers who have just begun facilitating PD courses in addition to their classroom teaching. To better understand these novice facilitators’ practices, a commognitive approach was implemented to examine how they draw on their mathematics teaching experience when leading PD courses. In commognitive terms, these practitioners draw on multiple professional discourses, but mostly on the discourses of teaching and facilitation. The analysis of the challenges and affordances associated with participating in these two professional discourses showed that novice facilitators bring into play their teaching practices in four distinct ways: enacting a familiar practice, negating a familiar practice, questioning the relevance of a familiar practice, and generating a new practice based on their teaching experience. We claim that novice facilitators’ well-established identity as teachers is both a challenge and an asset in grounding successful facilitation practices. Overall, facilitators modify their teaching experience through the adoption, adaptation, and retraction of their teaching practices. Implications for the preparation and support of facilitators, within processes of upscaling PD programs, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preparing in Advance to Respond in-the-Moment: Investigating Parallel Changes in Planning and Enactment in Teacher Professional Development</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Despite warrants for classroom discussion, research consistently finds that discussions in K-12 classrooms remain rare. Our research investigates whether and in what ways practice-based teacher learning opportunities focused on discussion facilitation influence opportunities for student talk. Grounded in data from a job-embedded professional development program for fourth- to eighth-grade literacy teachers, we analyzed videos of teachers co-planning and co-facilitating discussions with students. Findings indicate that, across 1 year, during co-facilitated classroom discussions, teacher talk decreased, while student talk increased. In a parallel finding, our analysis of co-planning sessions revealed that the ways teachers planned for discussions also changed. Teachers went from engaging only in what we call proactive pedagogical reasoning to balancing that with what we have come to call responsive pedagogical reasoning.

        <title>Educational Stakeholder Sensemaking on Preparing CTE Students for Sub-Baccalaureate Pathways</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Careful implementation of Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs is necessary in order for programs to achieve the policy goal of college and career readiness, which involves expanding student opportunities for career-relevant learning without limiting their academic preparation for postsecondary degrees. As programs become more widespread, little work has examined how practitioners actually implementing CTE make sense of programs’ intended outcomes. Through interviews and observations with 52 education leaders and their partners in workforce development, I found that education stakeholders believed CTE was important for providing students with the option to pursue financially low-risk pathways toward middle-skill careers that didn’t require bachelor’s degrees. Yet in their efforts to valorize sub-baccalaureate (sub-BA) pathways, they sometimes exaggerated the long-term returns to sub-BA credentials, leaving students with inaccurate information on which to base their postsecondary goals.

        <title>Conceptions of Educational Equity</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;“Educational equity” is universally lauded but equally ill-defined. At least five contrasting meanings of equity are in current use: equal distributions of outcomes across populations; equal outcomes for every child; equal resource allocations across students, schools, districts, states, or nations; equal experiences for each child; and equal levels of growth by each child. Furthermore, these conceptions are themselves often subsumed to concerns for benefiting the less advantaged, ensuring educational adequacy, or prioritizing short-term benefits versus long-term structural change. Researchers, educators, and policy makers alike will benefit from understanding these distinctions and trade-offs, not least in order to reimagine and restructure the unjust conditions that make some of those trade-offs unavoidable in the first place.

        <title>Intermediary Public Policy Organizations and the Discursive Evasion of Systemic Racism and Racialized Violence</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The 2020 health pandemic and high-profile police murders of Black people inspired national conversations about racism and police brutality. This study examined how Intermediary Public Policy Organizations (IPPOs) discursively engaged with the racialized nature of the pandemic and the police murder of George Floyd, which have increased awareness of systemic racism in society. Our discursive analysis of IPPO statements published during these events revealed a pattern of humanizing higher education institutions, race evasive policy proposals, and a lack of policy action addressing systemic racism. IPPO evasion of race is consequential because it has the potential to limit the ability of public policy to dismantle systems of oppression and highlights the need for race-conscious policies to support Black, Indigenous, and people of color students and communities.

        <title>The Evolving Identities of HSI and Differentiated Funding</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;To achieve Higher Education Act Title V funding goals, policymakers must reconsider approaches, respond to Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) diversity, and prioritize servingness. This study investigated HSI heterogeneity across traditional performance metrics and student-engagement indicators using data sources previously only examined independently. A multi-step TwoStep cluster analysis revealed six clusters of HSIs. The two most important predictors of cluster membership were years with an HSI designation (transitioning and established) and institution type (associate, bachelor, and special focus). Key quantitative metrics may be useful for policy actors seeking an equity-minded Title V award strategy that considers HSI heterogeneity and prioritizes HEA Title V policy aims.

        <title>A Critical Qualitative Study of Inequities in Hispanic-Serving Institutions’ Grant-Seeking Competitiveness</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Hispanic-Serving Institutions’ (HSIs) diversification and Title V’s anemic funding present a ripe condition for inequity. Hence, I interviewed 29 institutional actors across 17 HSIs to understand how they view their competitiveness for these grants and sources of inequity of this program. I identified four themes, demonstrating that an HSI’s institutional capacity, (in)actions, knowledge, and leadership inform its competitiveness for Title V funding. The findings show that HSIs have unequal organizational conditions and reveal ways this program may (re)produce inequity among HSIs. Without increased Title V appropriations and policy modification, HSIs will vie for funding on increasingly unequal terms, resulting in greater inequity.

        <title>Developing algebraic activity through conjecturing about relationships</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This manuscript contributes to research on how algebraic thinking about operations and properties can develop, and relevant forms of curricular activity. The key question asked is: how can students’ early algebraic activity be fostered through focusing on relations involving operations and properties? We adopt Radford’s three aspects of algebraic thinking (indeterminacy, denotation and analyticity), which focus on considering, symbolising and operating on unknown objects. We investigate the work of a class of 11–12 year old students in re-analysing data collected over 20 years ago as part of a project exploring algebraic activity. Our findings point to the proposal that a focus on conjecturing about relationships can be a powerful route into early algebra. On the basis of our analysis we propose an extension to Radford’s third aspect of algebraic thinking (analyticity) to include &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;structuring a mathematical space&lt;/em&gt;, e.g., through a set of conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The impact of COVID-19 on the format and nature of academic conferences in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The global COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to re-examine the possibility of organising virtual conferences in mathematics education, in which the social needs of participants can also be addressed. In this study we investigated the future impact that this change may have on the format and nature of mathematics education conferences. The study was conducted in two phases. We used an online questionnaire in which we asked participants to give us some input on the issues above. In the second phase of the project, focus group interviews were conducted with international mathematics education researchers&lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; This study is an exploratory study, in which the sample was not developed in a way that could generate comparisons. The aim of the study was to raise possibilities about what may be the future of mathematics education conferences. Findings indicate that although academics are pro-actively thinking about alternative conference formats, the proven value of face-to-face conferences is still very real, showing that it is too early for us to have a clear vision of the future format of academic conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Towers of Linking Cubes to the Binomial Expansion Theorem: What Can Be Learned About Combinatorics?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;While helping proofread a book during my doctoral studies, I came across a chapter that included (among other things) a discussion of a set of problems and tasks involving the building of towers using only two (or three) colours of cubes (Maher &amp;amp; Ahluwali, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r5&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/span&gt;). Later that year, as I started my tenure track position at the University of Regina, I decided to bring one of those tasks, “to account for all possible three-tall towers using two colours” (pp. 567, 568), into the pedagogy and mathematics content courses that I was teaching. My goals were simple: to find out how the students thought about combinatorics using a situation that was most likely unique to them, and to inspire them to actually work with some of the plethora of manipulative materials in our “math lab.” The actual outcomes, however, went well beyond those goals, as problems related to common words used in relation to combinatorics, connections to Pascal’s triangle, and the development of the binomial expansion theorem also emerged during the pre-service teachers’ explorations of the two-coloured towers. As the task expanded into a suite of tasks and learnings over time, it also led the students and me to a new conundrum: “How did the permutations captured in the built towers change to combinations in the binomial expansion theorem?” This article reflects on the journey to an answer, while also leading to some questions about the existing literature related to the two-colour-tower tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Special educators’ knowledge of student mathematical thinking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To anticipate and respond to the diverse ways of reasoning students with disabilities use to make sense in inclusive mathematics classrooms, special educators require a deep understanding of a diverse array of student thinking. Unfortunately, historic and contemporary data suggest that opportunities for special educators to develop this knowledge prior to classroom teaching are diminutive. Further inquiry is needed into pre-service experiences that might support growth in teachers’ knowledge. We present results from a US-based semester-long course grounded in neurodiversity and students’ mathematical thinking designed to improve 20 special educators’ pedagogical content knowledge. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to determine how the pre-service teachers anticipated students’ diverse mathematical thinking before and after experience in the course along with their propensity to adapt problems to respond to diversity during instruction. Furthermore, the pre-test to post-test changes in pre-service teachers’ anticipations of students’ problem-solving strategies and adaptations of problems were statistically significant. Implications for teacher preparation and future research are shared.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using scripting tasks to reveal mathematics teacher candidates&#39;  resources for responding to student errors</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Practice-based pedagogies, such as representations of practice and approximations of practice, are increasingly common in mathematics teacher education. More needs to be known about how teacher candidates&#39; (TCs&#39;) productions through such activities make visible the resources they bring to the work of teaching. In this paper, we highlight our use of “scripting tasks,” through which secondary mathematics TCs produced dialogues of classroom interactions and rationales for those scripts in response to a provided classroom scenario. We share how analyses of TCs&#39; scripts and rationales can make visible a range of resources that TCs bring to the work of teaching—tools and practices, vision and dispositions of teaching, and understandings of students and content (Hammerness et al., 2005)—that inform how they respond to student contributions in whole-class discussions as a focal teaching practice. We illustrate a rich example and framework for analyzing TCs&#39; responses to scripting tasks and offer implications for how such analyses can support teacher educators and researchers to make claims about TCs&#39; learning and inform decisions about supports for TCs&#39; development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning to design effective professional development: The influence of integrating a coaching tool with an elementary mathematics specialist course assignment</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As content-specific educational coaches, elementary mathematics specialists (EMSs) have emerged as school-based professionals who are needs-driven and work closely with school stakeholders in regard to mathematics teaching and learning. While leading mathematics education organizations have identified the specialized knowledge and skills required for EMS positions, how to best prepare these individuals is knowledge that the field is still exploring. This paper first presents a theoretical model for EMS preparation that aligns an emerging coaching tool, the Decision-Making Protocol for Mathematics Coaching (Baker &amp;amp; Knapp, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r75&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;, [DMPMC]) with the Professional Development Design Framework (Loucks-Horsley et al. in Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics, Corwin Press, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r35&quot;&gt;2010&lt;/span&gt;). The paper then presents a descriptive case study that examines the application of this model in an EMS preparation course. The findings indicate that assessing the coaching situation fostered administrative partnerships, revisiting goals increased specificity of anticipated outcomes, and applying research-informed practices increased EMS self-efficacy and advanced coaching agendas. Taken together, these findings suggest that integrating the DMPMC into an EMS preparation course led to positive changes in EMS candidate learning of professional development design. Notably, this is one of the first studies that documents the influence of a coaching education tool on EMS candidates’ professional development design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(Mis)alignment between noticing and instructional quality: the role of psychological and cognitive constructs</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we investigated the relationship between teachers’ post-instruction noticing (PIN) and the quality of their mathematics instruction. We analyzed the conversations of elementary teachers around five coached lessons and scored their level of post-instruction noticing and the mathematical quality of the instruction of the lesson. We compared teachers’ PIN levels with their instructional quality, using scores from the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric, for each coached lesson. There was both alignment and discrepancies between the level of PIN and MQI scores. Explorations of the cognitive and psychological constructs that seemed to influence teacher’s noticing showed that mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), efficacy, beliefs, emotions, and identity was influential on teachers’ PIN although they seemed to influence teachers differently. In some cases, the constructs appeared to support attentiveness to students’ thinking and in other cases they did not. We discuss implications for professional development and future research on teachers’ noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The time is out of joint. Teacher subjectivity during COVID-19</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we address the issue of mathematics teachers&#39; personal and professional responsiveness to changing circumstances, such as the shift in external demands made on teacher practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For investigating a such delicate issue, we take a theoretical approach, which is quite novel in the field of mathematics education: Lacan&#39;s psychoanalytical lens. Specifically, we will use this psychoanalytical lens to analyze a case study focusing on a primary school teacher during the first lockdown in Italy, during which school was organized exclusively in the form of distance education. The analysis of the teacher’s crisis and the strategies she adopted to overcome this crisis give some suggestions about possible directions and issues to consider for future mathematics teacher training proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
