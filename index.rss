        <title>The Development of Collaborative Advocacy: Dialogic Engagements Over Time and Texts</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article contributes to a growing conversation of teachers’ advocacy for marginalized students. We follow a cohort of teachers’ advocacy from their English as a second language certification courses into their work in one linguistically diverse school district. Dialogic discourse analyses of 3 years of discussions show the types of advocacy in which the teachers engaged, and identify five foundational discourse moves teachers employed to develop ideas and manage the relational complexity of advocacy. Findings provide evidence of the important role of intertextuality: voices across time and texts facilitated the teachers’ advocacy efforts. We offer a revised definition of language teacher advocacy to emphasize its discursive nature, arguing that an examination of the dialogic processes of advocacy work can help better delineate how it develops iteratively, contextually, and not always successfully. We implicate teacher education as an important catalyst for the preparation of teachers’ advocacy for under-served and historically marginalized English-learning students.

        <title>Centering community building to facilitate transformative change for new teachers: An action research study</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the context of increasingly complex challenges facing 21st century school systems, action research has incredible potential to help leaders address persistent problems and implement context-specific, sustainable solutions. Just as powerful, the action research process can be transformative for the individuals, groups, and organization involved. The authors, a doctoral candidate and associate professor, illustrate these concepts by sharing experiences leading an action research study that tackled the problem of high teacher turnover in a school-university partnership context. The article focuses primarily on the constructing phase of the action research cycle, in which the school-university partnership action research team becomes a learning community. The authors offer practical advice for building trusting relationships and share the story of how this team experienced individual and group transformation while designing innovative new teacher support through the action research process.

        <title>Do Simulated Teaching Experiences Impact Elementary Preservice Teachers’ Ability to Facilitate Argumentation-Focused Discussions in Mathematics and Science?</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Recently scholars have advocated for using teachers’ practice as a site for teacher learning. The recent proliferation of online, digital spaces, including simulated classrooms, has paved the way for novel approaches within practice-based teacher education. Yet, limited research has investigated the extent to which and how the use of online, simulated teaching experiences promote teacher learning of core teaching practices. The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how integrating simulated teaching experiences into teacher education coursework impacts preservice teacher (PST) learning. Findings showed that the use of simulated teaching experiences within elementary teacher education methods courses resulted in evidence of statistically significant growth in PSTs’ ability to engage in one core teaching practice: facilitating argumentation-focused discussions.

        <title>Are We Moving the Needle on Racial Disproportionality? Measurement Challenges in Evaluating School Discipline Reform</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Challenges in the measurement of racial disparities in school discipline are a significant barrier to identifying policy and programmatic reforms that are effective at closing gaps. This article reviews key measurement issues and presents a set of empirical analyses as an illustrative case study. Specifically, we reframe the interpretation of discipline data in light of initiatives designed to reduce racial discipline disparities. We also characterize common metrics and recognize several additional ones for use in discipline disproportionality outcome evaluations. Leveraging a statewide policy reform as an example, we report findings from a quasi-experimental evaluation, which demonstrated that the various metrics can point to differing conclusions. We conclude with proposed guiding principles for the selection and use of discipline disproportionality metrics in evaluations.

        <title>The Cost of Retention Under a Test-Based Promotion Policy for Taxpayers and Students</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Prior research substantially overstates the cost of retention under test-based promotion policies to both taxpayers and students who delay labor market entry because it omits two important factors. First, there is a delay between the intervention and the taxpayer’s expenditure. Second, on average, the treatment leads to less than a full year of additional schooling. I provide formulas for calculating the cost of grade retention within a test-based promotion policy and illustrate using data from Florida. Retaining a third-grade student under Florida’s policy was about 45% less costly to taxpayers and about 37% less costly to retained students than would be suggested by prior authors.

        <title>Identifying and Negotiating Productive Instructional Improvement Goals in One-on-One Mathematics Coaching</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A major affordance of one-on-one mathematics coaching is its potential to provide individualized, contextualized support for mathematics teachers’ learning. Coaches can adjust their work to individual teachers by focusing on instructional improvement goals that take account of teachers’ current knowledge, practice, and classroom contexts. It is, however, essential that coaches and teachers work to attain productive instructional improvement goals that are both feasible for teachers to attain and likely to result in immediate improvements in students’ learning, if attained. In this article, we describe how coaches can identify productive goals for individual teachers and then, on that basis, negotiate goals successfully with teachers, thereby supporting teachers in seeing productive goals as worthwhile. By describing these two processes, we further clarify the forms of coaching-specific expertise central to effective one-on-one mathematics coaching.

        <title>The Revealed Preferences for School Reopening: Evidence From Public-School Disenrollment</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Before the 2020–2021 school year, policymakers and parents confronted the uncertain trade-offs implied by the health, educational, and economic consequences of offering instruction remotely, in person, or through a hybrid of the two. Most public schools in the United States chose remote-only instruction, and enrollment fell dramatically (i.e., a loss 1.1 million K–12 students). We examine the impact of these choices on public-school enrollment using panel data that combine district-level information on enrollment and instructional mode. We find offering remote-only instead of in-person instruction reduced enrollment by 1.1 percentage points (i.e., 42% greater disenrollment). The disenrollment effects of remote instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, more modestly, elementary schools. We do not find evidence that hybrid instruction had an impact.

        <title>Presentation of Scientific Practices in Elementary Level Science Trade Books: An Examination of Trends Across Grade Level Bands</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;With limited time for science, using science trade books for science and language instruction has become more common in elementary schools. Studies show that trade books often neglect scientific practices. Yet previous analyses have not differentiated by targeted grade level nor by book type. Do some grade levels and types of books highlight scientific practices more comprehensively than others? To answer this question, 110 science trade books published in 2010–2016 were analyzed using the eight science and engineering practices highlighted in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A Framework for K-12 Science Education&lt;/em&gt; (National Research Council in A framework for K-12 science education: Practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas, The National Academies Press., Washington, DC, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r29&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/span&gt;). The sampled books were coded as demonstrating or not demonstrating each of the eight scientific practices with respect to the targeted grade band (K-2, K-5, or 3–5). Results indicate that books targeting K-2 and K-5 reading levels contained fewer practices compared to those targeting grades 3–5. Book type also mattered. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Biographies&lt;/em&gt; and books describing specific work of scientists (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Scientist in the Field&lt;/em&gt; books) captured many scientific practices. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Science Facts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Science Story&lt;/em&gt; books contained fewer practices and dominated the younger grade bands (K-2 and K-5 targeted books), while the distribution of book types was more balanced in the 3–5 targeted books. Practices related to the traditional scientific method were more often common than practices representing social aspects of science (e.g., Argument from Evidence). Implications of findings are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Documenting two emerging sociomathematical norms for examining functions in mathematics teachers’ online asynchronous discussions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigated novice mathematics teachers participating in an online teacher education course focused on covariational reasoning and understanding the behavior of functions. The analysis centered on documenting the emergence of participants’ sociomathematical norms for engaging in online asynchronous discussions. In this paper, we characterized participants’ initial mathematical discourse and documented two emergent sociomathematical norms, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;explaining why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;emergent shape discourse&lt;/em&gt;. When participants &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;explained why&lt;/em&gt;, they used specific quantities or symbolic representations of functions to justify why function graphs have particular visual features. When participants engaged in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;emergent shape discourse&lt;/em&gt;, they coordinated change between covarying quantities to justify why function graphs behave in certain ways. This study provides evidence that online settings can provide context for mathematics teachers engaging in legitimate collaborative mathematical activity and that activity can be enhanced by participation in discourse featuring specific sociomathematical norms. We discuss conjectures regarding the potential of reflective discussion activities paired with the Notice and Wonder Framework to support the emergence of generative sociomathematical norms. We also discuss potential relationships between characteristics of participants’ mathematical discourse and their membership with the core and periphery of a social network.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stepping in or Stepping On: Mentor Teachers’ Preferences for Mentoring Inside and Outside of Interactive Teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Much research describes how mentor and novice teachers interact when pupils are not present (e.g., co-planning, debriefing). However, little research investigates how mentor/novice pairs interact when K–12 students are present. This gap in the literature is significant because research suggests that without intentional mediation, novices often fail to see much of what happens in classrooms. This article investigates and conceptualizes what 27 mentors think about mentoring practices that occur outside versus inside of instructional time. An analysis of mentor interviews found that mentors prefer to interact with novices outside of instructional time because they fear undercutting novices’ authority and autonomy when interacting with them during instruction. However, findings also suggest that hybrid practices (those that straddle the outside/inside boundary) are valued by mentors although they are rarely enacted. This finding has implications for programs interested in supporting mentors to diversify the practices they employ to support novice teachers.

        <title>Teacher Preparation Programs and Graduates’ Growth in Instructional Effectiveness</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many prior studies have explored average differences in initial levels of teaching effectiveness among graduates from different teacher preparation programs (TPPs) and the features of preparation that predict these differences. We focus on another important dimension of effectiveness—how graduates from different TPPs improve over time. Examining all graduates from Tennessee TPPs from 2010 to 2018, we find meaningful differences between TPPs in both initial level and early-career growth in teaching effectiveness. We also find that different TPP features explain part of these differences. Yet the features that correlate with initial teaching effectiveness are not the same features that correlate with growth. This article informs policy decisions around TPP evaluation and identifies new directions for future research in TPP effectiveness.

        <title>Preservice primary school teachers’ attitudes towards mathematics: a longitudinal study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Numerous preservice primary school teachers begin their training with a negative attitude towards mathematics: this phenomenon can have important consequences for their training path and for their future teaching. How teachers’ training programs could affect preservice teachers’ attitudes is one of the main issues in research on future teachers in the field of mathematics education. However, longitudinal studies developed during specific teacher development programs are still rare in the research field of teacher development. In this frame, this paper reports on the results of a longitudinal 2-year study carried out within the initial training of 35 preservice primary school teachers. According to the three-dimensional model of attitude towards mathematics, we developed the analysis of future teachers’ emotional disposition towards mathematics, vision of mathematics, and perceived competence in mathematics, at the beginning of the training path and after 2 years. We found two main results on two different levels. First, a positive change in future teachers’ attitude towards mathematics, generalized over all the three dimensions, occurred during the training period, and this result opens the issue of the relationship between formative choices and change in attitude. Second, our data confirm the strong relationship between the three dimensions of attitudes: every change in one dimension affects the other two dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Studying while anxious: mathematics anxiety and the avoidance of solving practice problems during exam preparation in college calculus</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students who experience mathematics anxiety have long been suggested to engage in avoidance behaviors that negatively impact their mathematics performance. However, little is known about how these avoidance behaviors manifest for highly anxious students within the context of a mathematics course. Since the use of effortful study strategies has been shown to be an important predictor of students’ academic outcomes, we investigated whether highly mathematics-anxious college students would be less likely to utilize such strategies during exam preparation compared to their less-anxious peers. To measure this, we asked college students (N = 72) enrolled in introductory Calculus to complete a battery of anxiety-related surveys and to retrospectively report how they studied for the final exam in their Calculus course. Using theories of achievement emotion as well as recent research showing a relation between mathematics anxiety and students’ planned exam preparation behavior, we hypothesized that students experiencing mathematics anxiety would retrospectively report less engagement with effortful study strategies during exam preparation compared to their less-anxious peers. In line with our hypothesis, we found that solving practice problems was viewed by students as being one of the most effortful ways to prepare for a mathematics examination, and that mathematics anxiety was negatively associated with the proportion of study time students allocated to solving practice problems during exam preparation. These findings highlight the significant relation between mathematics anxiety and students’ self-regulated exam preparation behaviors, marking it as an important topic to consider when investigating ways to improve the mathematics performance of highly mathematics-anxious individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study explores the diversity of university mathematics teachers’ perspectives and experiences in relation to the secondary-tertiary transition (STT). Data for this study consist of responses of 310 university mathematics teachers from 30 countries to a survey. The survey design and data analysis are informed by an adaptation of a theory of improvement for education and by four idealized approaches for improving STT as identified in the literature: jump-oriented, enculturation-oriented, diversity-oriented, and cross-community-oriented. We characterize the diversity of perspectives and experiences in the data and examine ideas for future projects in light of these four approaches. We conclude that while jump-oriented approaches for improving STT are still the most prevalent, in part due to a persistent perspective of STT as a “deficit,” university mathematics teachers’ discourse on STT is becoming more diverse and nuanced. We find it particularly promising that participants’ suggestions for future action are aligned with the four approaches, and most notably, with the cross-community approach expressing the emergent need for greater communication between the secondary and tertiary mathematics education communities.&lt;/p&gt;
