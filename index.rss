        <title>Nonparametric Classification Method for Multiple-Choice Items in Cognitive Diagnosis</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The multiple-choice (MC) item format has been widely used in educational assessments across diverse content domains. MC items purportedly allow for collecting richer diagnostic information. The effectiveness and economy of administering MC items may have further contributed to their popularity not just in educational assessment. The MC item format has also been adapted to the cognitive diagnosis (CD) framework. Early approaches simply dichotomized the responses and analyzed them with a CD model for binary responses. Obviously, this strategy cannot exploit the additional diagnostic information provided by MC items. De la Torre’s MC Deterministic Inputs, Noisy “And” Gate (MC-DINA) model was the first for the explicit analysis of items having MC response format. However, as a drawback, the attribute vectors of the distractors are restricted to be nested within the key and each other. The method presented in this article for the CD of DINA items having MC response format does not require such constraints. Another contribution of the proposed method concerns its implementation using a nonparametric classification algorithm, which predestines it for use especially in small-sample settings like classrooms, where CD is most needed for monitoring instruction and student learning. In contrast, default parametric CD estimation routines that rely on EM- or MCMC-based algorithms cannot guarantee stable and reliable estimates—despite their effectiveness and efficiency when samples are large—due to computational feasibility issues caused by insufficient sample sizes. Results of simulation studies and a real-world application are also reported.

        <title>Backtalk: It’s time to (re)evaluate evaluation</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; The summer after Amanda S. Frasier left K-12 teaching to return to high education, she received an email stating that her students’ end-of-year assessments were in. When she looked at the scores, she was pleased to see they had done so well, even though she questions the value of standardized accountability measures and didn’t learn anything new from the results. Frasier discusses why these scores are not helpful and advocates more meaningful measures.

        <title>Career Confidential: Teacher wants to motivate an apathetic student</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; In this monthly column, Phyllis Fagell answers work-related questions from educators. This month, an elementary school teacher wants suggestions for how to help a formerly diligent student who now won’t do any work. A teacher at a competitive high school is worried about the high level of stress among her students. And a teacher who is new at her school wonders if it’s already time to leave after her department chair screamed at her because of a scheduling conflict.

        <title>De-escalating ‘dataveillance’ in schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 23-27, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; T. Philip Nichols and Alexander Monea explore the spread of data-driven surveillance (i.e., dataveillance) technologies in schools, which are increasingly used as a strategy for mitigating safety risks. They argue that the sense of security schools derive from these technologies often comes at the cost of students’ actual well-being and privacy. Drawing on research with teachers and administrators, they highlight several ethical challenges dataveillance technologies raise as they are incorporated into classrooms. They conclude with suggestions for how educators might de-escalate their dependence on dataveillance without compromising students’ safety.

        <title>Helping schools prepare for and prevent the worst: A conversation with Jaclyn Schildkraut</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 30-33, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; About 95% of schools nationwide hold lockdown drills for students and staff in response to security concerns, including an active shooter. Jaclyn Schildkraut, the interim executive director of the Regional Gun Violence Research Consortium, talks about the importance of performing lockdown drills in a trauma-informed way. Through her work and research with the Syracuse City School District, she recommends best practices and stresses the importance of training for school staff.

        <title>The Editor’s Note: No easy answers on safety</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; As incidents of violence in schools proliferate and receive media attention, members of the public have expressed support for a variety of safety measures. However, it’s not clear which measures are most effective, and some measures come with downsides. In this Editor’s Note for the December 2022/January 2023 issue of Kappan, Teresa Preston discusses some of the questions raised in the issue about how schools can keep students safe.

        <title>School safety for all students</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 6-11, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; In the wake of school shootings, attention invariably turns to how to make schools safer. But many of the strategies intended to secure schools against external threats yield unintended negative consequences for marginalized students, exacerbating racial and other inequalities. Meg Caven advocates for a definition of school safety that centers on equity and attends to students’ safety from emotional as well as structural violence. She concludes by highlighting the role that culturally responsive research can play in helping schools direct resources and refine safety strategies.

        <title>Safe, supported, and empowered</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-22, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Many effective strategies exist to keep students safe, supported, and engaged in school. Restorative practice (RP) is a powerful approach for achieving these goals as it elevates student voice and can strengthen school climate. Annie M. White and John Kenneth Weiss share findings from an initiative through which high school student-faculty teams learned strategies to use RP practices and incorporate student voice to improve school climate. After two years, students gained the confidence to work for school change. They offer implementation recommendations, including prioritizing relationship-building, reaching a critical mass, and providing structure for engagement. Ultimately, they found that student voice and engagement may be key to improving school climate.

        <title>Seeking safety in a ‘code’</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 12-17, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Although metal detectors, guards, and law enforcement officers are intended to protect students and maintain a safe educational environment, the actual effectiveness of such measures is unclear, especially when it comes to protecting Black students. Charles Bell interviewed Black students from urban and suburban schools across Michigan and learned that they did not feel safe at school. The absence of reliable safety measures at school leads students to rely on a “code” that provides protection in school by encouraging students to fight to demonstrate their toughness, win respect, and form alliances to ensure group safety. Among other things, the code of the school transforms suspension into a status symbol that undermines school authority, potentially increases school violence, and leads to the criminalization of Black students.

        <title>No more nice mentors</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-47, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; There is a cultural mismatch between teachers and students in classrooms across the U.S. that, despite teachers’ best intentions, too often leads to student harm. Mentors are uniquely positioned to interrupt conscious and unconscious bias that leads to inequitable practices but often have difficulty holding the necessary hard conversations. Among the reasons for this is socialized niceness, particularly in women, which prioritizes comfort and avoids conflict at all costs. Nina F. Weisling and Wendy Gardiner provide insights for recognizing, naming, and working through socialized niceness in mentoring to ensure all students have opportunities to learn in safe and rigorous classrooms.

        <title>The fraught connection between state and school</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 34-40, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Public schooling in the 19th century cultivated in students a shared sense of identity as citizens with a common culture. However, posits David Labaree, U.S. schools are less effective than they used to be at serving this purpose, making their value to the nation-state open to questioning. Labaree considers three common functions that public schools serve for the state — legitimacy, economic productivity, and civic community — and questions how well schools serve, or even undermine, these purposes. Schools rely on the state for support, but that support is in danger if systems of schooling promote division and are not perceived as promoting a common good.

        <title>On Leadership: Expectations and exceptions</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-61, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; It’s not always easy to balance high expectations with the need to make exceptions when students are struggling. The pandemic has made educators and the public more aware of how social-emotional needs can affect students’ ability to learn, but students still need to meet some academic standards. Joshua Starr suggests that knowing students personally and using data to understand students’ stories can help educators attend to student needs in ways that also support their academic development.

        <title>Policy Solutions: The policy of school policing</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; More than half of U.S. schools have no police presence on their campuses. Jonathan E. Collins proposes that all school buildings be free of police. School resource officers (SROs), he writes, do more harm than good. An alternate policy that would remove SROs from schools involves the framework of the community policing model. This model focuses on engaging students in full and deep discussions and problem-solving that reveals what students think of school safety and the root cause of school violence.

        <title>A lesson in motion stays in motion: If students lead, will teachers follow?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 48-53, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; While endorsed as critical for promoting learning, students’ interest in a topic has had minimal, if any, influence on curriculum development. Teachers thus are challenged to promote students’ interest within an established curriculum. After students demonstrated misunderstandings after reading an article about bacteria, Sarah Stallings and Samuel Miller, a 4th-grade teacher and university researcher, decided to base their instruction on students’ queries and concerns. This one lesson provided the impetus for a series of activities across the school year that allowed students to become more actively involved in choosing what they would learn and how they would learn it. What students viewed as important and interesting determined the nature and format of their daily studies.

        <title>First Person: How I gamified my classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-56, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; Former elementary school teacher Kasandra Singh shares how she used gamification to encourage her 5th-grade students to drive their own learning. Students were initially divided into groups based on their demonstrated ability to get their work done. Those in Level 1 were given direct instruction, those in Level 2 worked together to complete lessons with some teacher guidance, and students at Level 3 worked through assignments with limited teacher guidance when requested. Students and teacher worked together to determine when and how students could level up. As students showed mastery of lesson material, they received “badges” showing their accomplishments. And students motivated each other by awarding “awesomeness points” to deserving classmates. The system enabled students to learn to monitor and direct their own learning.

        <title>Under the Law: School safety: A legal labyrinth</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/104/4&quot;&gt;Volume 104, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 57-59, December 2022/January 2023. &lt;br/&gt; An array of federal, state, and local laws and policies come into play when situations arise that could compromise student safety. These laws and district policies combine to form an intricate and sometimes inconsistent patchwork of protocols that schools must follow. Robert Kim discusses the interplay between federal, state, and local laws governing schools’ responses to student misbehavior; the differing regulations surrounding different kinds of behavior; and the legal gray areas and judgment calls school personnel face when making disciplinary decisions.

        <title>Mixed Signals? Economically (Dis)advantaged Students’ College Attendance Under Mandatory College and Career Readiness Assessments</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In 2015, Wisconsin began mandating the ACT college entrance exam and the WorkKeys career readiness assessment. With population-level data and several quasi-experimental designs, we assess how this policy affected college attendance. We estimate a positive policy effect for middle/high-income students, no effect for low-income students, and greater effects at high schools that had lower ACT participation before the policy. We further find little evidence that being deemed college-ready by one’s ACT scores or career-ready by one’s WorkKeys scores affects college attendance probabilities. Pragmatically, the findings highlight the policy’s excellence and equity consequences, which are complex given that the policy has principally helped advantaged students. Theoretically, the findings shed light on students’ (dis)inclinations to update educational beliefs in light of new signals.

        <title>Classroom Promotion of Oral Language: Outcomes From a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Whole-of-Classroom Intervention to Improve Children’s Reading Achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/8&quot;&gt;Volume 8, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2022. &lt;br/&gt;Children need rich language learning experiences in school to build language and reading skills. Research suggests that various effective ways to support teacher provision of these experiences. The Classroom Promotion of Oral Language cluster randomized controlled trial (n = 1,360 students; 687 intervention, 673 control) examined whether a teacher professional learning intervention targeting oral language in the first years of school led to improved student outcomes compared to usual teaching practices. The intervention comprised face-to-face professional learning and ongoing support. The primary outcome was student reading ability at Grade 3; secondary outcomes included oral language, reading, and mental health at Grades 1 and 3. No differences were detected between the intervention and control arms. Implications of results and future directions are explored.

        <title>Unveiling the Causal Mechanisms Within Multidimensional Poverty</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Despite improvements in the design of development interventions from the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), there is still a lack of evaluation methods able to estimate the impact of these interventions on multiple and interrelated outcomes. This paper proposes a methodological framework for complex causal inference in international development that combines machine learning and econometric designs for causal inference. As a study case, the relationship between multidimensional poverty and violence in Colombia is evaluated following this framework. First, Bayesian networks (BN) are used to create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) able to predict how multidimensional poverty components are interrelated and affected by a violence indicator. Second, the DAG output is used to identify instrumental variables (IV) in order to test the effect of multidimensional poverty on a household’s likelihood to be a victim of violence. Minimum living standards—measured in terms of access to water, connection to the sewage system, and the quality of walls and floors—are strong predictors of the education and health dimensions of poverty. Using 2SLS, the results show that having an illiterate person within a household increases by 0.4% the household’s likelihood to be a victim of violence. BNs have the potential to predict complex causal patterns helping to understand the effect of development interventions on multidimensional outcomes such as poverty. Quasi-experimental econometric designs can then be used to test some of these predicted causal connections.

        <title>Mapping the Contributions of the Review of Educational Research to Education, 1931–2020</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The goals of this bibliometric review of the Review of Educational Research were to gain insights into the evolution of the journal and identify its key contributions to the education literature. Bibliographic data associated with the full set of 3,022 review articles published in RER from 1931 through 2021 were exported from Scopus for bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software. The review confirmed that RER remains rooted in the American education context, with scholars located outside the United States accounting for only 6% of the RER corpus. The review identified authors and documents published in RER that have had the greatest impact on the broader education literature. Author co-citation analysis visualized the “intellectual structure” of the RER corpus, which is anchored by a “school of thought” associated with Teaching and Learning Strategies and Effects. This research stream has been informed by complementary schools of researchers who have generated theory and research on cognition, teaching, and learning as well as motivation and learning. Although conceptual reviews of research are more prominent, meta-analytic reviews have also come to represent a key pillar in the intellectual structure of RER. Journal co-citation analysis validated the centrality of RER’s place within a community of highly ranked education and psychology journals. The findings confirm the strong disciplinary influence of psychology in shaping the journal’s direction and content. Adapting to a changing global research landscape in education was identified as a key challenge facing RER in the next decade.
