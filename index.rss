        <title>Secondary mathematics teachers learning to do and teach mathematical modeling: a trajectory</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study explores secondary mathematics teachers’ perceptions of the experiences that contributed to their capacities to understand mathematical modeling and to facilitate students’ modeling experiences. The retrospective research methods and transformative learning theory frame used in the study honor teachers as adult learners and value their perspectives while providing a way to study the complexity of learning to model and to teach modeling. Data analysis identified triggers and knowledge dilemmas that challenged and prompted teacher learning as well as opportunities to resolve dilemmas through rational discourse and critical reflection. Patterns in teacher-identified meaningful learning experiences reveal a trajectory with strands that address aspects of doing and teaching mathematical modeling: mathematics, social aspects of learning, real-world contexts, student thinking, and curriculum. Results of this study provide a holistic view of learning to do and teach mathematical modeling, complementing studies of designed professional learning interventions that out of necessity target specific parts of the modeling process. The results both support and challenge common teacher education content and practices. The study illustrates the usefulness of retrospective methods to understand teachers as lifelong learners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the Role of Technology in Asian Economies: The Environmental Impact of Remittances and Economic Complexity</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In recent years, scholars have determined various determinants of environmental degradation using the panel and time-series studies. However, technological innovations (TI) and remittances, among the financial system’s essential components, are relatively ignored. In addition, nations’ economic progress and environmental performance also depend upon the nature of their economic structure. This empirical research investigates the effects of TI, remittances and economic complexity (EC) on CO2 controlling economic growth and trade openness (TR) in the selected 15 Asian nations. The study collected panel data of 15 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019 and employed the panel quantile regression and augmented mean group methods to unveil the impacts of variables on CO2 emissions. The empirical findings established that remittances are negatively linked with CO2 emissions. Similarly, EC reduces CO2 emissions in the context of Asian countries. In addition, EC and remittances Granger cause CO2 emissions. These findings indicate that remittances and EC positively contribute to environmental quality in Asian countries. Conversely, TI, economic growth, and TR intensify CO2 emissions in Asian countries. Finally, the study recommended policies to enhance remittances and EC in Asian countries to curb environmental degradation.

        <title>Generalisation in students with autism spectrum disorder: an exploratory study of strategies</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Generalisation is a skill that enables learners to acquire knowledge in general, and mathematical knowledge in particular. It is a core aspect of algebraic thinking and, in particular, of functional thinking, as a type of algebraic thinking. Introducing primary school children to functional thinking fosters their ability to generalise, explain and reason with mathematical relationships. It also helps them overcome difficulties in understanding functions when they are exposed to the idea more formally in secondary education. Although more and more special education students are enrolled in mainstream schools, little is known about algebraic thinking in that community, especially in the case of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Students with ASD often exhibit deficits that interfere directly with mathematical learning. The study discussed here, which was conducted in the context of algebraic reasoning, was aimed primarily at identifying and describing the strategies and representations observed in 26 ASD primary education students when performing a task that involved a linear function, and describing the generalisations they performed. The 26 participants were enrolled in 19 mainstream Spanish schools. The tools used, a questionnaire and semi-structured interview, were designed to explore their ability to generalise in a problem involving the function &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;) = 2&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; + 2. The strategies identified included: (a) bald answering; (b) modelling with manipulatives; (c) drawing; (d) counting and (e) operating. The strategy most frequently observed was operating, represented verbally or symbolically, followed by drawing. Only three students generalised but did not reach the highest level of functional thinking, namely, ‘functions as objects’. The results are compared with findings for mainstream students of similar ages. Conjectures around the possible relationships between some findings and the type of thinking characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are put forward. The results carry implications for research with and teaching of students with ASD.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching and Learning the Notion of Normal Distribution Using a Digital Resource</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates the support provided using technology for learning the notion of normal distribution in high school students through the implementation of a teaching experiment. A strategy was designed and implemented using Fathom software as the main teaching resource. Data analysis focused on the role of the use of technology in student learning and the simulation process, considering the initial session. The conceptual framework was based on the documentational approach to didactics, whose perspective is to study the teacher’s use and design of resources in his teaching practice. Likewise, the results of the teaching experiment, whose objective was to introduce high school students to the notion of normal distribution by taking advantage of the repeated sampling resource using the Fathom software, are presented. The results show that the collaborative aspect of the lesson study methodology allowed professors to reflect and become aware of how they usually use the resources in their regular practice and thus contribute to improving their teaching activity. Evidence is provided on how students initiate a change in their reasoning to identify the probability of data collection from the simulation of problems with the software.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing equations in early algebra</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The overwhelming presence of a procedural meaning of equality and equations reported in previous research has led to a call for suitable pedagogical interventions to nurture a relational meaning of these concepts. This paper is a response to that call. Drawing on the theory of objectification, the first part deals with the configuration of a Grade 3 (8–9-year-old students) teaching–learning activity that seeks to create the classroom conditions for the formation of the mathematical operations and operation-based rules that underpin the algebraic simplification of linear equations. Instead of using problems involving abstract open arithmetic sentences or alphanumeric equations (e.g., &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(5 + \_\_\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; = 16; &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq2&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(2n + 3 = 11\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt;), the teaching–learning activity resorts to story-problems. Two visual semiotic systems serving to model and solve the story-problems were devised. The story-problems were framed in narratives that allowed the teacher and the students to infuse equations, their equating parts, and the mathematical operations with contextual meanings. The first part of the paper includes the theoretical assumptions about the teaching–learning activity and its configuration, and a rationale behind the devisal of the semiotic systems. The second part presents a Vygotskian multimodal genetic analysis of the teaching–learning activity; that is, an analysis that shows the formation of concepts &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;in motion&lt;/em&gt;, in the process of their genesis. The genetic analysis sheds some light on the way students, in their work with the teacher, encountered and refined the cultural-historical algebraic meanings of the equal sign and equations, and the concepts required in solving equations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Roles of technologies for future teaching in a pandemic: activity, agency, and humans-with-media</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research literature on the role of mathematics teachers during the COVID-19 crisis shows that teacher preparation for emergency situations is required. In reporting on this exploratory study, we present and analyse lesson plans created by seven future teachers for mathematics classes during the pandemic. Data were collected between April and October 2021 from 16 four-hour class sessions in a Mathematics Degree Program at a public university in Medellín, Colombia. The notion of Humans-with-Media and the Learning by Expanding theory were used as frameworks to understand what roles prospective mathematics teacher (PMTs) assign to technologies for teaching in pandemic conditions. The PMTs’ uses of technology for teaching mathematics during a pandemic were categorized. The results show that technology was used to reorganize and reproduce mathematics teaching practices. This report addresses the impact of technology on the activity system, and we conclude with a discussion of opportunities and limitations of students’ conceptions about teaching and technology during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Undergraduate Students’ Perceptions of Features of Active Learning Models for Teaching and Learning to Teach Mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The recent push toward active learning – engaging students in the learning process – is meant to benefit students. Yet there is still much to learn about students’ perceptions of this phenomenon. We share results from an interview study of students’ perceptions of features of two active learning models institutionalized at a large doctoral-granting university – a model for teaching foundational mathematics courses and an early field experience model for teaching preservice secondary students to teach mathematics. These models were implemented simultaneously in a single precalculus course. Interviews were conducted with both student populations (i.e., precalculus students and preservice teachers) to understand which in-class features of the models students noticed and identified as beneficial to their learning. Precalculus students identified specific opportunities related to active learning in the undergraduate mathematics teaching model – working in groups on mathematics tasks that engaged students in sensemaking and interacting with their instructor around mathematics. Preservice teachers identified specific opportunities related to three features of the university field experience model – observing a mathematics instructor enacting ambitious instructional practices, planning and teaching a “real” lesson, and observing student thinking and practicing teaching moves during groupwork. We conclude with pedagogical recommendations about particular features of the models that may help mitigate student resistance to active learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring the Perceived Relevance of University Mathematics Studies by First-Semester Teaching Students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As earlier research results suggest that many mathematics teaching students criticize a missing relevance in their studies, we explore explanations and interrelationships of their relevance assessments. We aim at finding out how one could support the students in attributing relevance to their study programs. A two-fold model for relevance assessments in mathematics teacher education is proposed, consisting of relevance content and relevance reasons. We investigate students&#39; relevance perceptions of mathematical topics and of topics’ complexities, as well as their rating of individual and societal/ vocational relevance reasons, all in relation to their perception of the relevance of their overall program of study. Contrary to earlier research findings, our results suggest that mathematics teaching students already do attribute relevance to many content areas and that a preparation for the teaching profession is not the only reason for them to assign relevance. There also seem to be many students who would attribute relevance if they could develop as individuals and pursue their interests. We suggest that giving students opportunities to set individual priorities in their studies could hence support their relevance assessments. As low relevance assessments seem to be connected to students’ motivational problems, students might profit from motivational support, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Centering Equity in Teacher Education Evaluation: From Principles to Transformative Enactment</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Since the early 2000s, accountability and evaluation have been regarded by policymakers as key mechanisms for “fixing” teacher education and by many teacher education leaders as vehicles for elevating the status of the profession and uniting a fragmented field. Although educational inequity has been an enduring and endemic problem during the same time period, most major policy proposals regarding teacher education evaluation and accountability have said very little about equity. This article makes an argument for equity-centered teacher education evaluation and accountability by highlighting nine innovative examples that collectively illustrate what it means and what it looks like to position equity at the center of teacher education evaluation/accountability. Together, these examples are intended to be generative, providing a lens into how the interrelated dimensions of strong equity-centered evaluation play out at different sites of practice and how equity initiatives emerge and operate at different levels of policy.

        <title>An Examination of State Statutes and School District Policies Addressing Minors With Do Not Resuscitate Orders</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Due to advances in medical treatments, students with terminal illnesses are more likely to attend public schools, increasing the possibility that they may die on school property. However, educational health plans often fail to consider end-of-life care decisions. In the absence of federal or state statutes, school boards are left to navigate the issue of minors with Do Not Resuscitate Orders while at school. We examine state statutes and school board polices for minors with Do Not Resuscitate Orders attending or wishing to attend school. Themes from school district policies are discussed, and recommendations for federal, state, and local policymakers are made.

        <title>Estimating the Impact of Emergency Assistance on Educational Progress for Low-Income Adults: Experimental and Nonexperimental Evidence</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Methods for estimating causal impact aim to either remove or reduce bias. This study estimates the degree of bias reduction obtained from regression adjustment and propensity score methods when only a weak set of predictors are available. The study uses an experimental test of providing emergency financial assistance to participants in a job training program to estimate an experimental benchmark and compares it to nonexperimental estimates of the impact of receiving assistance. When estimating the impact of receiving assistance, those who received it constitute the treatment group. The study explores two different comparison groups: those who could have (because they were assigned to the experimental treatment group) but did not receive emergency assistance; and those who could not receive emergency assistance because they were randomly assigned to the experimental control group. It uses these groups to estimate impacts by applying three estimation strategies: unadjusted mean comparison, regression adjustment, and inverse propensity weighting. It then compares these estimates to the experimental benchmark using statistical tests recommended by the within-study comparison literature. The nonexperimental approaches to addressing selection bias suggest large positive impacts. These are statistically different from the experimental benchmark, which shows that receipt of emergency assistance does not improve educational progress. Further, over 90% of the bias from a simple comparison of means remains. Unless a stronger set of predictors are available, future evaluations of such interventions should be wary of relying on these methods for either unbiased estimation of impacts or bias reduction.

        <title>Observing Intellectual Need and its Relationship with Undergraduate Students’ Learning of Calculus</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The concept of intellectual need, which proposes that learning is the result of students wrestling with a problem that is unsolvable by their current knowledge, has been used in instructional design for many years. However, prior research has not described a way to empirically determine whether, and to what extent, students experience intellectual need. In this paper, we present a methodology for identifying students’ intellectual need and report the results of a study that investigated students’ reactions to intellectual need-provoking tasks in first-semester calculus classes. We also explore the relationship between intellectual need, affective need, and students’ learning. Although the overall percentage of students who reported experiencing an intellectual need was low, we found positive associations between intellectual need and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sites of Educational Conflict</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Books for and in schools are commodities. They form a central part of the political economy of publishing. They are also, profoundly, sites of cultural and ideological conflict. While always there, there are periods when these economic and ideological conflicts are even more powerful. This is just such a time. This reality asks us to also examine places in school buildings that might (often wrongly) seem to some people to be “less important.” Among these places is the school library as a resource, a teaching device, an access point to things seen as controversial, a mirror of conflicts and economic and political transformations, and for many students, at times a sanctuary. American Public School Librarianship: A History provides us with a richly sourced account of the development of a key pedagogic site in schools and of many of the personal, institutional, and political reasons why they do—and do not do—certain things.
