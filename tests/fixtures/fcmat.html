                    On the eve of what was expected to be a long and gut-wrenching trial, a small school district in Santa Barbara County has settled a sexual abuse lawsuit for $7.5 million with two brothers, now 65 and 68 years old, who claimed a long-dead principal molested them in the 1970s.

                    A group of families reached a settlement with the Los Angeles Unified School District as part of a class action lawsuit that claims the district’s distance learning practices during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic were inadequate and discriminated against Black and Latino students, as well as those from financially disadvantaged backgrounds.
