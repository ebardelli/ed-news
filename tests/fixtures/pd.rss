					<description><![CDATA[Payroll cuts, including workforce reductions, are expected to make the biggest dent in the $10-15 million in savings the district needs to achieve this school year to curb the risk of state takeover. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santa Rosa City Schools is turning to pay cuts for its top administrators and other district managers as another way to dig out of its financial crisis &#8212; and lay the groundwork for more campus staff layoffs that top officials say are inevitable to stave off the threat of state takeover.</p>
<p>To begin with, Interim Superintendent Lisa August made voluntary concessions that will reduce her annual pay by just over $18,600, and in the following two years by $17,700 and $15,100. Her current base salary is $261,537.</p>
<p>Reductions in payroll, including workforce cuts, are expected to make the biggest dent in the $10-15 million in costs the district needs to eliminate this school year. About 85% of the annual budget goes to cover staff costs.</p>
<p>If the district, Sonoma County&#8217;s largest, does not make significant headway identifying savings by February, officials say, it will be at imminent risk of running out of cash and falling into state receivership &#8212; a first for any school system in the county.</p>
<p>“As we look at all options to address current and long term budget impacts… it does involve looking at employee concessions,” August said at the Oct. 8 board meeting. “It’s important that this process start at the top.”</p>
<p>The moves come after the district closed four campuses this past June and looks to close at least two more at the end of this school year in a historic reconfiguration that has not been enough to close its multiyear deficit.</p>
<p>Teachers and other district staff have long pointed to what they call bloated, top-level staffing at the district office, including dozens of administrators drawing six-figure salaries.</p>
<p>Early this year, before board members finalized 150 layoffs – mostly teachers and their support staff – Santa Rosa Teachers Association President Kathryn Howell asked the district to instead look inward first and to the top of its payroll when making job cuts.</p>
<p>“We always talk about cuts far away from the classroom and these don’t seem like those cuts,” Howell said at the February board meeting where layoffs were announced. “These seem like the district structure that’s already top heavy with administration, is maintaining that top-heaviness.”</p>
<p>In the past five years, even as student enrollment continued to drop, extending a decadelong trend at Santa Rosa City Schools, the district office grew from 36 administrators to 44 at the start of this school year, equating to a total general fund cost for the district of $4.8 million. Some of the positions are supported by other funds, including grants.</p>
<p>Two of the newest administrators include a director of school innovation, engagement and strategic outreach who leads the progress on the district’s transition to junior-senior campuses and a coordinator of curriculum and professional learning.</p>
<p>Both those jobs draw six-figure salaries. One is fully covered by outside funds. The other, the director of school innovation, is 75% funded by grants. The district&#8217;s share of the salary is $34,575.</p>
<p>August acknowledged the added cost to the district but she said the long-term work from the hire will payoff.</p>
<p>“Something we’re criticized for often is not having a concerted outreach and marketing when working with our feeder schools and making sure that we are capturing all of the students living in our district,” she said. “This position is absolutely to support that, as well as the success of 7-12 high schools.”</p>
<p>Still, she emphasized the need to continue making cuts at all levels, including the district office.</p>
<p>“Everything has to be looked at again, always,” August said. “There’s a difference between operating with optimal staffing versus the staffing you need to get by. That&#8217;s what we have to look at as we’re moving forward.”</p>
<p>The district’s assistant superintendents are next up to take salary concessions; the board of trustees is set to take action on those pay cuts at its meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>Following those administrators, managers at the district and campus level will vote in groups on whether to take concessions, August said.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the seven-member school board was the first make pay concessions. Trustees voted to suspend their 5% stipend increase approved in June, equating to an individual monthly cut of about $26; board members receive a monthly stipend of about $550. In total, the savings from their collective cut will amount to just over $1,600 by the end of the fiscal year June 30.</p>
<p>“The concessions that were made, yes it’s minimum in the big scope of things,” August said. “But when we look at all of the little drops in the budget that add up, that’s how expenses go up.”</p>
<p>All but one trustee, Omar Medina, voted to approve the stipend cut at the Oct. 8 board meeting. Medina felt the suspension would harm recruitment for trustees in the future. The other six trustees felt the move was both necessary and symbolic.</p>
<p>“If we don’t go first as an entity then we are setting a terrible example for everyone else that we’re going to be asking to help solve this problem that fundamentally, as the entity of the board, we created,” board Vice President Nick Caston said at the meeting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The White House has faced a flurry of rejections from universities to become 'initial signatories.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By COLLIN BINKLEY, AP Education Writer</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The five universities that were still weighing President Donald Trump’s higher-education <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-political-agenda-colleges-federal-money-756407729a3b16c7bb51564d5056084c">compact</a> were asked to join a White House call Friday to discuss the proposed deal, according to two people familiar with the matter. By late Friday afternoon, one of the schools — the University of Virginia — had already declined to sign the agreement.</p>
<p>The people who shared details of the call spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.</p>
<p>The White House has faced a flurry of rejections after inviting nine universities to become “initial signatories” of the compact, which asks colleges to make commitments aligned with Trump’s political priorities in exchange for favorable access to research funding. The White House asked university leaders to provide initial feedback on the compact by Oct. 20, yet as the deadline approaches, none have signed on to the document.</p>
<p>Those that have not yet announced a decision are Dartmouth College, the University of Arizona, the University of Texas and Vanderbilt University. They did not immediately respond to questions about Friday’s call.</p>
<p>The University of Virginia on Friday became the fifth university to decline to participate in Trump&#8217;s compact. Providing federal money based on anything but merit would undermine the integrity of research and further erode public confidence in higher education, the university&#8217;s interim president said in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and White House officials.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working together to develop alternative, lasting approaches to improving higher education,” Paul Mahoney wrote.</p>

<p>Leaders of the University of Texas system previously said they were honored to be included, but other universities still weighing the deal have not indicated how they’re leaning.</p>
<p>It’s unclear exactly what universities have to gain by agreeing to the deal — or what they stand to lose if they don’t. In a letter sent alongside the compact, Trump officials said it provided “multiple positive benefits,” including favorable access to federal funding. In exchange, colleges were asked to adopt 10 pages of commitments aligned with Trump’s views.</p>
<p>The administration asked for commitments to eliminate race and sex from admissions decisions, to accept the government’s strict binary definition of “man” and “woman,” to promote conservative views on campus and to ensure “institutional neutrality” on current events, among other provisions.</p>
<p>“Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,” the compact said.</p>
<p>The issue weighed on some students at Vanderbilt on Friday, with some worrying the university might sign the agreement even after student and faculty groups condemned it.</p>
<p>“My major concern is just that this is like a first hook,” Marjolein Mues, a postdoctoral researcher in language development in the brain, said in an interview at the Nashville campus. “And once universities agree to this, the terms will change, and more and more will be asked of universities, and that maybe the government will start to interfere more with the types of research being done here.”</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mit-higher-education-compact-trump-627997083eee635fb865249f1bcc3244">decline the deal</a> last week, saying it would limit free speech and campus independence. Similar concerns were cited in rejections from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brown-compact-higher-education-trump-b883cf9c23eaed7ee1ba9819430d33d8">Brown University</a>, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California.</p>
<p>The compact — which aims to reshape higher education through negotiation rather than legislation — has stirred a wave of pushback from academia and beyond. It has been protested by students, condemned by faculty and drawn the ire of Democrats at all levels. Gov. Gavin Newsom in California and Democrats in Virginia have threatened to cut state funding to any university that signs on.</p>
<p>In a joint statement Friday, more than 30 higher education organizations urged the administration to withdraw the compact. Led by the American Council on Education, an association of research universities, the coalition said the agreement would give the government unprecedented control over colleges&#8217; academics and hinder free speech.</p>
<p>“The compact is a step in the wrong direction,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Many of the terms align with recent deals the White House struck with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-brown-funding-e38e4c6f05fec3fab56d6235c829257e">Brown</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-trump-deal-00eef5dca9f003e593d2cb151f5cce17">Columbia</a> universities to close investigations into alleged discrimination and to restore research funding. But while those agreements included terms affirming the campuses’ academic freedom, the compact offers no such protection — one of the roadblocks cited in Brown’s rejection.</p>
<p>Trump has made it a priority to win obedience from powerful and prestigious universities that he describes as bastions of liberalism.</p>
<p>His top prize has been Harvard, the first university to openly defy a set of wide-ranging demands from the government. The White House went on to slash <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2025/harvards-challenge-to-trump-administration-could-test-limits-of-government-power/">billions of dollars</a> in research funding at Harvard, cancel its federal contracts and attempt to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Boston <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-trump-federal-funding-bdde8f529f01b96d5521d0e248e8fc6c">reversed the funding cuts</a> last month, calling them an unconstitutional overreach.</p>
<p>Several other prestigious universities have also had their funding cut amid investigations into alleged antisemitism.</p>
<p>White House officials described the offer as a proactive approach to shape policy at U.S. campuses even as the administration continues its enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>Trump on Sunday said colleges that sign on will help bring about “the Golden Age of Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” Speaking on his Truth Social platform, he said it would reform universities that are “now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.”</p>

<p>After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: “Are we going to be replaced with AI?”</p>
<p>That remains to be seen. But for the nation’s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-cheating-school-chatgpt-4f89a552e9093ce2180471b4d4736675">help students use the technology</a> wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world’s largest technology companies. The two groups don’t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.</p>
<p>Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country’s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/artificial-intelligence">race for AI dominance</a>.</p>
<p>AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.</p>
<p>“There is no one else who is helping us with this. That’s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,” Weingarten said. “We went to them — they didn’t come to us.”</p>
<p>Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an “agnostic” approach that means any company’s AI tools could be used in a training session.</p>
<p>Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.</p>

<h4>Tech money will build an AI training hub for teachers</h4>
<p>With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.</p>
<p>The National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of “microcredentials” — online trainings open to the union’s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA’s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.</p>
<p>“We tailored our partnership very surgically,” Bilal said. “We are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.”</p>
<p>Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-artificial-intelligence-3763ca207561a3fe8b35327f9ce7ca73">encouraged the private investment</a>, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve “global dominance in artificial intelligence.” The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/edai/">100 companies</a> have signed up.</p>
<p>Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft’s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.</p>
<p>Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-ai-use-school-essay-7bc171932ff9b994e04f6eaefc09319f">rapidly increasing</a> but training and guidance are lagging.</p>
<p>The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what’s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.</p>
<p>“These are private initiatives, and they are run by companies that have a stake,” Lake said.</p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Brad Smith agrees that teachers should have a “healthy dose of skepticism” about the role of tech companies.</p>
<p>“While it’s easy to see the benefits right now, we should always be mindful of the potential for unintended consequences,” Smith said in an interview, pointing to concerns such as AI’s possible impact on critical thinking. “We have to be careful. It’s early days.”</p>
<h4>Teachers see new possibilities</h4>
<p>At the San Antonio AFT training, about 50 educators turned up for the three-hour workshop for teachers in the Northside Independent School District. It is the city’s largest, employing about 7,000 teachers.</p>
<p>The day started with a pep talk.</p>
<p>“We all know, when we talk about AI, teachers say, ‘Nah, I’m not doing that,’” trainer Kathleen Torregrossa told the room. “But we are preparing kids for the future. That is our primary job. And AI, like it or not, is part of our world.”</p>
<p>Attendees generated lesson plans using ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Microsoft CoPilot and two AI tools designed for schools, Khanmingo and Colorín Colorado.</p>
<p>Gabriela Aguirre, a 1st grade dual language teacher, repeatedly used the word “amazing” to describe what she saw.</p>
<p>“It can save you so much time,” she said, and add visual flair to lessons. She walked away with a plan to use AI tools to make illustrated flashcards in English and Spanish to teach vocabulary.</p>
<p>“With all the video games, the cellphones you have to compete against, the kids are always saying, ‘I’m bored.’ Everything is boring,” Aguirre said. “If you can find ways to engage them with new technology, you’ve just got to do that.”</p>
<p>Middle school teacher Celeste Simone said there is no turning back to how she taught before.</p>
<p>As a teacher for English language learners, Simone can now ask AI tools to generate pictures alongside vocabulary words and create illustrated storybooks that use students’ names as characters. She can take a difficult reading passage and ask a chatbot to translate it into Spanish, Pashto or other languages. And she can ask AI to rewrite difficult passages at any grade level to match her students’ reading levels. All in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>“I can give my students access to things that never existed before,” Simone said. “As a teacher, once you’ve used it and see how helpful it is, I don’t think I could go back to the way I did things before.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Only days before they were set to walk off the job, Napa Valley College employees called off what would have been the first strike in the school’s history.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just days before they were set to walk off the job, Napa Valley College employees called off what would have been the first strike in the school’s history.</p>
<p>At a board meeting Thursday, President Torence Powell announced that the classified union had reached a tentative agreement with the college administration after a day of negotiations, canceling the planned two-day strike.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to the classified representatives who came to the table with the spirit of collaboration and I extend sincere appreciation to our district bargaining team for their dedication and service,” Powell said. “This agreement is a testament to the shared commitment of both classified professionals and district representatives. By working together in solidarity, we continue to move forward as one team.”</p>
<p>The terms of the agreement were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the classified union had announced <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/08/26/napa-valley-college-staff-authorize-first-ever-strike-as-contract-fight-deepens/">plans to strike</a> early next week to protest what they called unfair labor practices. After more than a year without a contract, the college’s classified employees — which includes custodians, technicians and office staff — said the college had failed to make fair offers on pay and working conditions. Faculty members, also working under an expired contract since June 2024, had planned to join the strike in solidarity.</p>
<p>The tentative agreement will now go to classified union members for approval before returning to the board for ratification.</p>
<p>“As members of the campus community may know, the union and the district were engaged in mediation all day today,” Amanda Frost, representing the classified union’s bargaining team, said at the board meeting Thursday.</p>
<p>“The parties were able to reach a potential tentative agreement, which we will present to our union members for their consideration and recognition. To that end, we are canceling Monday&#8217;s planned strike activities in order to allow our membership time to vote on the proposal.”</p>
<p>For the roughly 125-member classified union, stagnant salaries and what they called the college’s “overuse” of temporary employees were major sticking points in the long negotiation process. Heavy reliance on short-term hires, they argued, drained training resources and undermined efficiency. Between fall 2020 and fall 2024, the college’s classified staff shrank from 187 to 153, according to data from the state chancellor’s office.</p>
<p>Classified employees, represented by the local SEIU Local 1021, also pointed to rising administrative pay while many of them work second jobs, buy groceries on credit and struggle to afford living in Napa.</p>
<p>Faculty, represented by a separate union, have <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/03/26/asking-for-basics-napa-valley-college-employees-push-for-wage-gains-in-next-contract/">pushed for higher pay</a> for months but have not held a strike vote of their own. The faculty union continues to negotiate without a deal.</p>
<p>Faculty association president John Kincheloe congratulated classified staff on their tentative deal and said he hopes a similar resolution can soon be reached with his union.</p>
<p>“Our negotiations at this point are about hope,” he said. “We&#8217;re very close but we&#8217;re arguing over this concept of hope in a sense – hope that we get to increase our compensation in the future to meet our expectations of the value we hold to NVC, hope to someday meet the increasing demands of the cost of living in Napa County and hope to continue to be appreciated as an integral part of NVC.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Confidence in higher education has dropped due to high tuition, student loans and a tough job market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By COLLIN BINKLEY, Associated Press Education Writer</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college — or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/skipping-college-student-loans-trade-jobs-efc1f6d6067ab770f6e512b3f7719cc0">whether to go at all</a> — has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?</p>
<p>Public confidence in higher education has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/higher-education-confidence-survey-574e02d8478d3c1a7567a54f61af11f1">plummeted</a> in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/student-loans">student loans</a> and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-graduates-job-market-unemployment-c5e881d0a5c069de08085a47fa58f90f">dismal job market</a> — plus <a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-college-trump-harvard-higher-education-109dae2e19d5fe570a7c02e105bab6e6">ideological concerns</a> from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.</p>
<p>Borrowed from the business world, the term “return on investment” has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.</p>
<p>“Students are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn’t pay off,” said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “It’s front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.”</p>
<h4>Most bachelor’s degrees are still worth it</h4>
<p>A wide body of research indicates a bachelor’s degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there’s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/college-graduates-job-market-unemployment-c5e881d0a5c069de08085a47fa58f90f">toughest job markets in years</a>.</p>

<p>A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds <a href="https://www.strada.org/state-opportunity-index">70% of recent public university graduates</a> can expect a positive return within 10 years — meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.</p>
<p>It’s a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-education-utah-1847b218b1398ed17b4c32021033e64e">ever pay off</a>, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school’s students come from low-income families, and many aren’t willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.</p>
<p>Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.</p>
<p>“A lot of families are just saying they can’t afford it, or they don’t want to go into debt for years and years and years,” she said.</p>
<p>Education Secretary <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/linda-mcmahon">Linda McMahon</a> has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying kids shouldn’t go to college,” she said. “I’m just saying all kids don’t have to go in order to be successful.”</p>
<h4>Lowering college tuition and improving graduate earnings</h4>
<p>American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation — tuition costs and graduate earnings. It’s becoming even more important as colleges compete for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-f1-student-visa-trump-college-3f10a430b4ee48342ecb62d47c53cfbc">decreasing numbers of college-age students</a> as a result of falling birth rates.</p>
<p>Tuition rates <a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-university-of-wisconsin-business-state-budgets-c1d8fd9b270bee46e4bc118f0c2dccda">have stayed flat</a> on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.</p>
<p>The other part of the equation — making sure graduates land good jobs — is more complicated.</p>
<p>A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup’s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren’t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to get out in front of that,” he said.</p>
<p>The issue has been a priority for Guskiewicz since he arrived on campus last year. He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market’s needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.</p>
<h4>A disconnect with the job market</h4>
<p>Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn’t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.</p>
<p>“No programs are immune, and no schools are immune,” Sigelman said.</p>
<p>The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama’s administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.</p>
<p>A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.</p>
<p>Others see transparency as a key solution.</p>
<p>For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a> in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cta_textpdf.pdf">bipartisan legislation</a> in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state’s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.</p>
<p>The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don’t.</p>
<p>Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.</p>
<p>“In uncertain times, students are even more focused — I would say rightly so — on what their job prospects are going to be,” he added. “So I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rincon Valley Union School District leaders outlined an $8.5 million shortfall driven by declining enrollment, increased staffing costs and multiple years of deficit spending.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A small elementary district in northeast Santa Rosa has emerged as the latest Sonoma County school system to announce a multi-million dollar budget deficit that will require significant cuts.</p>
<p>Rincon Valley Union School District leaders said the $8.5 million shortfall they are facing could be rectified through $4.3 million in cuts this fiscal year and $4.2 million next year. The cuts to come would follow on the heels of significant staff layoffs this past spring.</p>
<p>The deficit, which represents about 8% of the overall budget, is driven by multiple factors, many of them shared across local districts under financial strain: declining enrollment; increasing payroll costs; a loss of one-time funding available during the pandemic; and higher-than-expected costs for students in special education.</p>
<p>Those factors have slowly put the district in a fiscal hole, said Superintendent Mike Herfurth, the top administrator of the 3,200-student, eight-school TK-6 district.</p>
<p>“We’ve had previous years of deficit spending… where we’ve made that difference up by pulling from our reserves,” he said. “But now we don’t have that money in the reserves to pull from.”</p>
<p>That problem is not unique. Santa Rosa City Schools is going into a second year of campus closures, headed for $10-15 million more in cuts before the school year is over to ward off state takeover. Sonoma Valley Unified School District voted to close one of its elementary schools to manage its deficit. Petaluma City Schools is putting forward a parcel tax on November&#8217;s ballot to raise $3 million a year over eight years for its strained budget.</p>
<p>The state requires that all school districts keep at least 3% of their overall budget in a reserve pool, to be used when there is not enough money in a district’s general fund to cover costs. Based on Rincon Valley’s complete budget, it should have just over $2 million in its reserves.</p>
<p>The target figure of $4.3 million in cuts next year is geared to help replenish the reserves and account for the increased operating costs and declining revenue, tied mostly to the drop in enrollment and ebb of one-time funding. Those cuts will be identified before mid-March 2026.</p>
<p>What comes next for the district will depend in part on a small committee of staff and community members <span style="color: #000000">formed </span>at the start of the month. That panel will work to identify solutions to propose to the five-member district board.</p>
<p>With 85% of the district’s budget spent on staffing, union leaders are bracing for layoffs.</p>
<p>Tim Hite, union president for the district’s certificated staff – made up mostly of teachers – is part of the budget committee that met for the first time Oct. 8, where district officials gave a presentation on operating costs.</p>
<p>“They said, ‘Here’s what the costs are in salaries to people’ and that’s where it seems like they were leaning, is to cut staff,” Hite said.</p>
<p>This past spring, the district laid off the equivalent of 35 staff at various levels including instructional aides, counselors, support coordinators and other one-site staff. They also cut into management, eliminating three administrators in the district office along with four staff members, including a translator, one tech specialist and a business analyst.</p>
<p> Operating costs for five district departments were cut by 15% to 19%.</p>
<p>The total savings made up $3 million of the district&#8217;s $4 million savings goal.</p>
<p>A major factor of the overspending last <span style="color: #000000">fiscal </span>year and in years prior is increased staffing costs. The certificated group received three years of salary increases: 6% in the 2023-24 school year, 5% in the 2024-25 school year, and 1% in the current year, when district leaders said they could not afford the high percentage increases anymore.</p>
<p>The wage gains came in a hard-won contract following a <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2021/05/01/at-impasse-rincon-valley-teachers-ok-permission-to-call-strike/">strike authorization by the district&#8217;s teachers in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The district also is looking reduce legal costs, contracts and services and the costs for hiring substitutes through agencies.</p>
<p>Hite, the union official, worries the first cuts to come will hit support staff like the classroom aides, <span style="color: #000000">some of whom were already</span> let go last spring.</p>
<p>“It’ll impact children in different ways,” Hite said. “They’re not going to develop those skills to be successful in the whole classroom… Having one person, a skilled educator with 32 students with all varied needs, having the support system in place to be able to bring forward our learners most in need – it’s going to be all back in the classroom.”</p>
<p>Herfurth said the district will try to make staff cuts that are “as far away from students as possible.”</p>
<p>“We’re trying to be very transparent,” Herfurth said. “We also want to make sure we are doing this right away. So we’re not kicking this down the road and we end up in trouble.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The cancellation halts statewide training for teachers helping children with disabilities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A $10.5 million federal grant that trained California educators to better support children with disabilities has been abruptly canceled — three years before its funding was set to expire — because it conflicted with “the priorities of the current administration,” officials say.</p>
<p>The Partnerships for Effective Practices in Transition and Inclusion, or PEPTI Project, had been funded since 2023 through a five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The money supported statewide training for child care practitioners and teachers to help children with disabilities transition into preschool and succeed in the classroom. The effort was facilitated by the Napa County Office of Education on behalf of the California Department of Education.</p>
<p>Now, after training more than a hundred educators across the state, the program is being shut down.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cancellation puts all this work in jeopardy and cuts short planned future impacts,&#8221; said Seana Wagner, spokesperson for the Napa County Office of Education.</p>
<p>In September, the California Department of Education received notice that the federal government was ending the PEPTI Project. The state appealed the decision, and education groups including the California School Boards Association and the Association of California School Administrators sent letters of support. But the U.S. Department of Education denied the appeal.</p>
<p>According to a report prepared for that appeal, much of the state’s training infrastructure for early childhood special education will now disappear. The Napa County Office of Education anticipates some of the eight staff members employed on the project will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Of the total $10.5 million grant, California had already received $6.5 million before the cancellation, resulting in a $4 million loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very unfortunate. (This was) excellent work all around the state,&#8221; Napa County Superintendent of Schools Joshua Schultz said at a board of education meeting last week. &#8220;It was canceled explicitly because there was language addressing our work around DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) in the application, which of course was a priority of the funding at the time we applied over three years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Press Democrat reached out to the U.S. Department of Education for comment, but the agency&#8217;s press team and David Cantrell, deputy director of the Office of Special Education Programs, are on furlough due to the <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/10/13/government-shutdown-length/">ongoing federal government shutdown.</a></p>
<p>The cancellation comes amid sweeping layoffs at the Department of Education under the Trump administration — part of mass firings across the federal government that have reduced the agency’s workforce to less than half its size before President Donald Trump took office. According to multiple <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5572489/trump-special-education-department-funding-layoffs-disabilities">reports</a>, the latest layoffs included dozens of employees in the office that oversees special education, leaving only a handful of top officials.</p>
<p>The PEPTI Project was funded through a State Personnel Development Grant, a competitive program within the Office of Special Education Programs that helps states improve training for early childhood educators under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Nearly 40 states currently <a href="https://signetwork.org/spdg-grantees#table">receive similar grants</a>. Until this year, California’s grant — administered through the Napa County Office of Education — had been renewed continuously for more than 25 years.</p>
<p>The project focused on two key goals: helping families of children with disabilities navigate the transition to preschool, and coaching teachers on effective classroom practices. County offices of education in Humboldt, Mendocino, Imperial and Napa, along with several school districts, participated in the coaching program. With the cancellation, each site will now need to build and fund its own system to replace PEPTI’s centralized training.</p>
<p>A report by PEPTI staff found that children in classrooms using the program made measurable gains in language, communication and social skills. Teachers reported improved understanding of what children with disabilities were capable of and greater collaboration between general and special education staff.</p>
<p>The project also supported a state workgroup dedicated to improving early childhood programs for children with disabilities.</p>
<p>California Department of Education spokesperson Michelle Hatfield said the department is assessing the impact of the loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, young children with disabilities and the educators who serve them are being punished by this action,&#8221; Schultz said in a statement to The Press Democrat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By SEAN MURPHY</strong></p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma’s new public schools superintendent announced Wednesday he is rescinding a mandate from his predecessor that forced schools to place Bibles in classrooms and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-bible-schools-religion-ryan-walters-d15be2f74df2ffbbdfdc549569d06c4e">incorporate the book</a> into lesson plans for students.</p>

<p>Superintendent Lindel Fields said in a statement he has “no plans to distribute Bibles or a Biblical character education curriculum in classrooms.” The directive last year from former Superintendent Ryan Walters drew immediate condemnation from civil rights groups and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-bible-mandate-schools-lawsuit-c5c09efa5332db1ab16f7ff2da7be0b8">prompted a lawsuit</a> from a group of parents, teachers and religious leaders that is pending before the Oklahoma Supreme Court. It was to have applied to students in grades 5 through 12.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to the superintendent’s post after Walters <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-school-superintendent-ryan-walters-96567486aa0a2cd03e3f8f40e66b29dc">resigned last month</a> to take a job in the private sector.</p>
<p>Jacki Phelps, an attorney for the Oklahoma State Department of Education, said she intends to notify the court of the agency’s plan to rescind the mandate and seek a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they were encouraged by Fields’ decision and plan to discuss next steps with their clients.</p>
<p>“The attempts to promote religion in the classroom and the abuses of power that the Oklahoma State Department of Education engaged in under Walters’ tenure should never happen in Oklahoma or anywhere in the United States again,” the attorneys said in a statement.</p>
<p>Many schools districts across the state had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bible-mandate-oklahoma-schools-bixby-superintendent-19e235a16d9aefd350df9106a5d759b3">decided not to comply</a> with the Bible mandate.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the state education department, Tara Thompson, said Fields believes the decision on whether the Bible should be incorporated into classroom instruction is one best left up to individual districts and that spending money on Bibles is not the best use of taxpayer resources.</p>
<p>Walters in March had announced plans to team up with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lee-greenwood-president-donald-trump-interview-god-bless-usa-86144215124bd4a826a3bbcf720726d6">country music singer Lee Greenwood</a> seeking donations to get Bibles into classrooms after a legislative panel rejected his $3 million request to fund the effort.</p>
<p>Walters, a far-right Republican, made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-education-teachers-superintendent-walters-c5c55e473eaeb0c94545c8ae5753149a">fighting “woke ideology”</a>, banning certain books from school libraries and getting rid of “radical leftists” who he claims were indoctrinating children in classrooms a focal point of his administration. Since his election in 2020, he imposed a number of mandates on public schools and worked to develop <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-curriculum-2020-election-misinformation-bbc05b14c3d7a858014f6acefc326ec6">new social studies standards</a> for K-12 public school students that included teaching about conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election. Those standards <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-standards-election-misinformation-ryan-walters-bd2f5336aeada1b3b9f353c0b9e048a9">have been put on hold</a> while a lawsuit challenging them moves forward.</p>
<p>Thompson said the agency plans to review all of Walters’ edicts, including a requirement that applicants from teacher jobs coming from California and New York <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-teacher-test-ideology-california-new-york-1d08d0ef4e6e3dc71d8537601d8455e9">take an ideology exam</a>, to determine if those may also be rescinded.</p>
<p>“We need to review all of those mandates and provide clarity to schools moving forward,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brown is the latest to turn down the proposal; MIT backed away last week.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By COLLIN BINKLEY, Associated Press</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Brown University is rejecting a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-political-agenda-colleges-federal-money-756407729a3b16c7bb51564d5056084c">Trump administration proposal</a> that would provide favorable access to funding in exchange for a wide range of commitments, saying the deal would curtail academic freedom and undermine the university’s independence.</p>
<p>Brown is the latest university to turn down the proposal, which White House officials said would bring “multiple positive benefits” including “substantial and meaningful federal grants.” The Massachusetts Institute of Technology <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mit-higher-education-compact-trump-627997083eee635fb865249f1bcc3244">backed away</a> from the proposal last week after its president said it would restrict free speech and campus autonomy.</p>
<p>Brown President Christina Paxson turned down the proposal on Wednesday in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and White House officials. The Ivy League university in Providence, Rhode Island is aligned with some of the provisions in the offer, she said — including commitments to affordability and equal opportunity in admissions — but can’t agree to others.</p>
<p>“I am concerned that the Compact by its nature and by various provisions would restrict academic freedom and undermine the autonomy of Brown’s governance, critically compromising our ability to fulfill our mission,” Paxson wrote.</p>

<p>Brown and MIT were among nine universities invited this month to become “initial signatories” to the proposal. Officials at the University of Texas system said they were honored to be invited, while most others have remained quiet. The Trump administration invited feedback from universities by Oct. 20 and requested decisions no later than Nov. 21.</p>
<p>Brown previously <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-brown-funding-e38e4c6f05fec3fab56d6235c829257e">struck a deal</a> with the Trump administration to restore lost research funding and end federal investigations into discrimination.</p>
<p>In that agreement, finalized in July, Brown agreed to a $50 million payout to workforce organizations in Rhode Island. It also agreed to adopt the federal government’s definition of “male” and “female,” to eliminate diversity targets in admissions and to renew partnerships with Israeli academics, among other terms.</p>
<p>Unlike that deal — which includes a clause affirming Brown’s academic freedom — Paxson said the new proposal lacks any guarantee that the university would retain control over its curriculum or academic speech. Her rejection is in line with the views of the “vast majority of Brown stakeholders,” Paxson wrote.</p>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, President Donald Trump suggested other campuses can step forward to participate in the compact. Those that want to return to “the pursuit of Truth and Achievement,” he said, “are invited to enter into a forward looking Agreement with the Federal Government to help bring about the Golden Age of Academic Excellence in Higher Education.”</p>
<p>In its letter to universities, the administration said the compact would strengthen and renew the “mutually beneficial relationship” between universities and the government. The compact is a proactive attempt at reform even as the government continues enforcement through other means, the letter said.</p>
<p>The proposal includes several commitments around admissions, women’s sports and free speech. Much of it centers on promoting conservative viewpoints, including by abolishing “institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The form determines eligibility for federal financial aid, including work-study and loans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By ADRIANA MORGA, Associated Press</strong></p>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fafsa-financial-aid-college-education-faf16cf14fb69a20e373d3ada1b63dca">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a> for the 2026-27 school year has officially opened.</p>
<p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-education-department-student-loans-fafsa-2511421f2e5fe73a83e24ebb6e1df00b">Education Department</a> will continue to process the FAFSA.</p>
<p>If you plan to attend college next year, Jill Desjean, director of policy analysis at The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, recommends that you fill it out as soon as you can.</p>
<p>If it’s your first time applying, here’s what you need to know:</p>
<h4>How does the FAFSA work?</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2023-fafsa-how-to-apply-9a17578e35899231232e1df5b7f7364a">FAFSA</a> is a free government application that uses students’ and their families’ financial information to determine whether they can get financial aid from the federal government to pay for college.</p>
<p>The application will send a student’s financial information to the schools they are interested in attending. The amount of financial aid a student receives depends on each institution.</p>
<p>The application is also used to determine eligibility for other federal student aid programs, like work-study and loans, as well as state and school aid. Sometimes, private, merit-based scholarships also require FAFSA information to determine if a student qualifies.</p>
<h4>What is the deadline to fill out the FAFSA?</h4>
<p>The FAFSA application for the 2026-2027 must be submitted by June 30, 2027. However, each state has different deadlines for financial aid. For example, California has a March 2, 2026, deadline and Kansas has an April 15, 2026, deadline for state financial aid programs.</p>
<p>You can check your state’s deadline <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines">here</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s application rolled out Sept. 24, a week ahead of the anticipated Oct. 1 launch.</p>
<p>“This is a really welcomed change and hopefully it will be a turning point where we can expect to see a FAFSA every year by or even before October 1st,” Desjean said.</p>
<h4>How can I prepare to fill out the FAFSA form?</h4>
<p>The first step in the process is to create a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa">studentaid.gov</a> account and gather the following documents:</p>
<p>— Social Security number</p>
<p>— Driver’s license number</p>
<p>— Alien registration number, if you are not a U.S. citizen</p>
<p>— Federal income tax returns, W-2s and other records of money earned</p>
<p>— Bank statements and records of investments</p>
<p>— Records of untaxed income</p>
<h4>Who should fill out the FAFSA?</h4>
<p>Anyone planning to attend college next year should fill out the form. Both first-time college students and returning students can apply.</p>
<p>“Even if you think you won’t qualify, the worst thing that can happen is that you might get finance aid you didn’t know you qualified for,” Desjean said.</p>

<p>Students and parents can use the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator/">federal student aid estimator</a> to get an early approximation of their financial package.</p>
<h4>What information do I need from my parents?</h4>
<p>If you are filing as a <a href="https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/parent-info">dependent student</a>, you’ll need to provide the financial information of at least one parent. Parents need to create their own <a href="https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch">FSA IDs</a>. When your parents fill out the application, they can manually input their tax return information or use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.</p>
