  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 60-76, March 2022. <br>The parameters of logit models are typically difficult to interpret, and the applied literature is replete with interpretive and computational mistakes. In this article, I review a menu of options to interpret the results of logistic regressions correctly and effectively using Stata. I consider marginal effects, partial effects, (contrasts of) predictive margins, elasticities, and odds and risk ratios. I also show that interaction terms are typically easier to interpret in practice than implied by the recent literature on this topic.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 77-88, March 2022. <br>In this article, I introduce two commands for computing the fragility index (FI): fragility, which is used for individual randomized controlled trials, and metafrag, which is used for meta-analyses. The FI for individual studies is defined as the minimum number of patients whose status would have to change from a nonevent to an event to nullify a statistically significant result. Correspondingly, the FI for meta-analyses is defined as the minimum number of patients from one or more trials included in the meta-analysis for which a modification of the event status (that is, changing events to nonevents or nonevents to events) would change the statistical significance of the pooled treatment effect to nonsignificant. Whether for an individual study or for a meta-analysis, a low FI indicates a more “fragile” study result, and a larger FI indicates a more robust result.

Since its conception and description by Weber and Péclat (2017, Stata Journal 17: 962–971), the command has been gradually maintained and enriched. The new version of georoute presented in this article encompasses major improvements, such as the possibility to specify transport mode and departure time. The new features open the way to a multitude of more sophisticated research applications.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 3-24, March 2022. <br>In this article, I describe some substantial extensions to the survsim command for simulating survival data. survsim can now simulate survival data from a parametric distribution, a custom or user-defined distribution, a fitted merlin model, a specified cause-specific hazards competing-risks model, or a specified general multistate model (with multiple timescales). Left-truncation (delayed entry) is now also available for all settings. I illustrate the survsim command with some examples, demonstrating the huge flexibility that can be used to better evaluate statistical methods.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 25-59, March 2022. <br>In this work, we describe the new command zonotope, which, by resorting to a geometry-based approach, provides a measure of productivity that fully accounts for the existing heterogeneity across firms within the same industry. The method we propose also enables assessment of the extent of multidimensional heterogeneity with applications to fields beyond that of production analysis. Finally, we detail the functioning of the software to perform the related empirical analysis, and we discuss the main computational issues encountered in its development.

CUB identifies the components that define the mixture in the baseline model specification. We apply maximum likelihood methods to estimate feeling and uncertainty parameters, which are possibly explained in terms of covariates.An extension to inflated CUB models is discussed. We also present a subcommand, scattercub, for visualization of results. We then illustrate the use of cub using a case study on students’ satisfaction for the orientation services provided by the University of Naples Federico II in Italy.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 125-133, March 2022. <br>In observational studies, regression coefficients for categorical regressors are overwhelmingly presented in terms of contrasts with a reference category. For unordered regressors with many categories, however, this approach often focuses on contrasting different pairs of categories to one another with little substantive rationale for foregrounding some comparisons with others. Mean contrasts, which compare categories with the overall mean, provide an alternative to the reference category, but the magnitude of mean contrasts is conflated with the relative sizes of the categories. Instead, binary contrasts compare a category with all the other categories, allowing the familiar interpretation for dichotomous regressors. Our command binarycontrast computes binary contrasts.

While effect-size measures such as Cohen’s d and Hedges’s g are straightforward to calculate for t tests, this is not the case for parameters in more complex linear models, where traditional effect-size measures such as η 2 and ω 2 face limitations. After a review of effect sizes and their implementation in Stata, I introduce the community-contributed command mces. This postestimation command reports standardized effect-size statistics for dichotomous comparisons of marginal-effect contrasts obtained from margins and mimrgns, including with complex samples, for continuous outcome variables. mces provides Stata users the ability to report straightforward estimates of effect size in many modeling applications.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 158-194, March 2022. <br>In some applications, only a coarsened version of a categorical outcome variable can be observed. Parametric inference based on the maximum likelihood approach is feasible in principle, but it cannot be covered computationally by standard software tools. In this article, we present two commands facilitating maximum likelihood estimation in this situation for a wide range of parametric models for categorical outcomes—in the cases both of a nominal and an ordinal scale. In particular, the case of probabilistic information about the possible values of the outcome variable is also covered. Two examples motivating this scenario are presented and analyzed.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 1, Page 103-124, March 2022. <br>In this article, we introduce two community-contributed data envelopment analysis commands for measuring technical efficiency and productivity change in Stata. Over the last decades, an important theoretical progression of data envelopment analysis, a nonparametric method widely used to assess the performance of decision-making units, is the incorporation of undesirable outputs. Models able to deal with undesirable outputs have been developed and applied in empirical studies for assessing the sustainability of decision-making units. These models are getting more and more attention from researchers and managers. The teddf command discussed in the present article allows users to measure technical efficiency, both radial and nonradial, when some outputs are undesirable. Technical efficiency measures are obtained by solving linear programming problems. The gtfpch command we also describe here provides tools for measuring productivity change, for example, the Malmquist–Luenberger index and the Luenberger indicator. We provide a brief overview of the nonparametric efficiency and productivity change measurement accounting for undesirable outputs, and we describe the syntax and options of the new commands. We also illustrate with examples how to perform the technical efficiency and productivity analysis with the newly introduced commands.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This study attempts to explore the causal linkage of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk, and tourism arrivals in the United States taking data from January to November 2020. In order to analyze the above relationship, this study uses a novel time-varying granger causality test developed by Shi et al. (2018), which incorporates its three causality algorithms such as forward recursive causality, rolling causality, and recursive evolving causality. The findings from forward recursive causality could not confirm any significant causal relationship between COVID-19 and tourism, geopolitical risk (GPR) and tourism, economic policy uncertainty and tourism, and geopolitical risk and COVID-19 but found causality between economic policy uncertainty and COVID-19. The rolling window causality reported bidirectional causality between COVID-19 and tourism and unidirectional causality running from tourism to geopolitical risk. However, the recursive evolving causality identified a significant bidirectional causal relationship between all the variables. Based on the findings, policy implications for the tourism sector are provided.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics teachers’ teaching beliefs play an important role in instructional practices and students’ achievement. In China, transmissive teaching beliefs were prevalent before 2001. Since then, a student-centered concept has been advocated in the national curriculum reform; however, few studies have assessed contemporary Chinese mathematics teachers’ teaching beliefs during the 20 years since the reform. In the current study, we elucidated the teaching beliefs Chinese teachers hold and their effects on instructional practices and students’ mathematics achievement. A total of 1463 mathematics teachers and 12,437 students in grade 4 were recruited from Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang in Eastern China. Based on self-reported teaching beliefs using a short revised version of the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), the study identified that contemporary Chinese teachers usually hold constructive teaching beliefs. In comparison, transmissive teaching beliefs showed significantly higher scores for teachers with more than 20 years of teaching experience. Moreover, male teachers and those with more teaching experience were more transmissive, but the effect of gender was small. The indirect effect of teachers’ teaching beliefs on students’ mathematics achievement through perceived constructive instructional practices was revealed using a multilevel structural equation model. This study illustrates the teaching beliefs of Chinese mathematics teachers and their effects, using evidence collected from a more general perspective.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Preservice elementary school teachers are under ever increasing pressure to deliver quality mathematics instruction to their students. Mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy are constructs that are commonly measured in preservice elementary school teachers and are used to help identify future challenges these preservice teachers might have when teaching mathematics. Mathematics teaching anxiety is a relatively new construct measured in preservice elementary school teachers. Mathematics teaching anxiety aims to separate the anxiety experienced when doing mathematics from the anxiety experienced when teaching mathematics. This study used a modified version of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to examine the relationship between mathematics anxiety, mathematics teaching anxiety, and mathematics teacher efficacy in preservice elementary school teachers in Ontario. Participants were preservice elementary school teachers across six teacher education programs in Ontario. Questionnaire data was gathered from 185 participants, 16 of whom were also interviewed. Results indicate that mathematics teaching anxiety is significantly correlated to both mathematics teacher efficacy and mathematics anxiety, but there was a lack of correlation between mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy. These results indicate that mathematics teaching anxiety does interact with mathematics anxiety; however, mathematics teacher efficacy and the introduction of mathematics teaching anxiety may disrupt the previous belief that mathematics anxiety and mathematics teacher efficacy are negatively correlated. Furthermore, interview and short answer responses showed that preservice elementary school teachers who were mathematically anxious were aware of their anxieties and developed methods of overcoming their feelings while maintaining effective teaching practices.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing literature measures the impact of education interventions in low- and middle-income countries on both access and learning outcomes. But how should one contextualize the size of impacts? This article provides the distribution of standardized effect sizes on learning and access from 234 studies in low- and middle-income countries. We identify a median effect size of 0.10 standard deviations on learning and 0.07 standard deviations on access among randomized controlled trials. Effect sizes are similar for quasi-experimental studies. Effects are larger and demonstrate higher variance for small-scale studies than for large-scale studies. The distribution of existing effects can help researchers and policymakers to situate new findings within current knowledge and design new studies with sufficient statistical power to identify effects.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Automatic admissions policies (AAPs, “percent plans”) redistribute college-going opportunities across segregated high schools to diversify college enrollments, increasing opportunities at predominantly minority high schools. If students “game” AAPs by attending schools with increased opportunities, AAPs could alter racial sorting across high schools. Comparative interrupted time series analyses provide evidence that Texas’s and California’s AAPs reduced Black–White segregation in highly segregated school districts. These effects were concentrated in sparsely populated areas in Texas, and they were modest in California, so it seems unlikely this significantly undermined AAPs’ ability to reduce racial disparities in college-going opportunities. It shows, however, that strategic responses to policies that redistribute opportunities in segregated contexts can create tension between segregation and inequality of opportunity.
