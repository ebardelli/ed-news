  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 68-68, November 2021. <br>Early childhood is a time when children begin building foundational skills of self-regulation and emotional competence. But, as Donna Housman explains, their teachers may not themselves have the training and support to help young students develop these abilities. She recommends that early childhood teachers receive professional development that helps them recognize and manage their own emotions, stress, and anxieties so they can better foster self-regulation among their students.

A recent 50-state scan shows that there is a great deal of variety in how these programs are designed and implemented, and data on the effectiveness of these programs to address teacher shortages is still emerging. Garcia discusses some specific programs that appear especially promising.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 64-65, November 2021. <br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that students, staff, and visitors at K-12 schools wear masks indoors, regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status, led numerous states to issue mask mandates for some or all K-12 schools. Most of the remaining states have decided to allow school districts to do whatever they want around masks, but a few banned local mask mandates. These developments invite a number of legal questions about the legality of mask mandates (and bans on those mandates). Robert Kim reviews the legal decisions issued thus far related to mask requirements.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 22-27, November 2021. <br>The education model in which a single teacher instructs a single classroom of students has been remarkably persistent, but teacher shortages, low morale, and poor teacher retention are signs that it’s not working well for teachers. Ray Reutzel and Parker Fawson describe how Utah’s Center for the School of the Future is seeking to redesign the teacher workforce to improve outcomes for both teachers and students without increasing costs. Their integrated workforce model brings students together in a pod led by a master teacher, classroom teachers, teacher interns, aides, and tutors. Students receive more individualized support, and prospective teachers have more opportunities to practice their skills before receiving a license and becoming a lead teacher. The model also includes pathways for paraprofessionals to complete education coursework while they continue to earn an income.

In this monthly column, Teresa Preston explores what authors have said about the personal qualities and training that teachers need. Common threads include a recognition that intelligence does not necessarily equate to teaching success and concern that alternate pathways were bringing unqualified teachers into classrooms.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 8-12, November 2021. <br>Drawing on nationally representative data from the 1988 to 2018 school years, the authors provide an overview of some of the key changes in the characteristics of first-year teachers in the U.S., including racial/ethnic identity, education levels, subject area, and certification status. The data also show that new teachers have become increasingly more likely, compared to experienced teachers, to work in schools with a greater fraction of students of color, which has consequences for equitable teacher assignments and teacher attrition.

Obi-Wan shows that there’s value in stepping away from the action to become a voice in the head of those on the front line, that it’s important to recognize that others may be better mentors, and that a time will come when others must take the lead.

As more teachers leave the profession, the teacher workforce is getting younger and greener. To stop the churn, school systems need to address the specific needs of their new teachers. Some are also beginning to pursue grow-your-own strategies that encourage current students, paraeducators, and other staff who are already invested in the community to become teachers.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 54-57, November 2021. <br>If schools are to prepare students to participate more productively in civic life, schools will need to ensure that they have opportunities to practice the skills of civic reasoning, argues Carol Lee. Yet schools are challenged by the limits in the curriculum and the difficulty of addressing the different types of prior knowledge that students bring to the classroom. Lee suggests that when schools build their content and pedagogy on current understandings of human learning, they will be better able to enable students from all backgrounds to practice building the understandings they need, now and in the future.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 58-59, November 2021. <br>Math coach Steven Goldman compares working the timer and scoreboard at a local basketball game to teaching. His mission as the clock guy is not to mess up. That means he avoids doing anything fancy or learning what any of the buttons do beyond the ones he needs. When he worked as a long-term sub for a colleague’s paternity leave, it would have been easy for him to have the same attitude. By trying to create new materials, Goldman risked making mistakes — and eventually he did. As a teacher who was new to the school, this mistake had the potential to carry higher consequences that it would for a veteran, making the temptation to simply watch the clock even greater.

Paul Bruno and Dan Goldhaber describe the waivers that states requested and received, what they suggest about how state test results might be used for different purposes and by different people, and what uses of testing seem to be most salient to policy makers. They conclude with recommendations for policy makers about how to design testing policy that can both improve educational outcomes and maintain robust political support, objectives achieved at best imperfectly by existing testing policy.

So far, there has been little research into the effects of the pandemic, but previous research shows that being away from school has more of an effect on students with learning disabilities. They also discuss how states are planning to use the funds made available under the American Recovery Plan and the challenge of balancing the need for flexibility to distribute funds quickly with the need to ensure that students’ needs are being met.

Ideally, education decision makers should look for randomized control trials with high effect sizes and low p-values.

Yet, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the school was able to maintain, and even exceed, its prepandemic metrics of achievement. Michael Lipset and Linda Nathan attribute this success to the school’s unique staffing structure. Instead of having content teachers attempt to meet the wide array of student needs on their own, the school takes a team-based approach, with traditional certified teachers serving as content advisers who manage student learning and other team members (many of whom have similar backgrounds as the students) addressing students’ personal needs. All faculty, no matter their specific role, are called facilitators of learning, but they focus on different ways of engaging students.

They used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Knowledge in Action (KIA) project-based curricula for AP courses. KIA students outperformed non-KIA students on AP exams, including within subgroups. Though the shift to PBL required considerable pedagogical changes, teachers and students perceived benefits beyond AP performance, and the majority of teachers planned to continue using PBL after the study. The pattern of results was consistent for two years and in two courses, AP U.S. Government and AP Environmental Science. Results support teacher-driven adoption of KIA for students from both lower- and higher-income households and in both courses.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Public support for school improvement policies can increase the success and durability of those reforms. However, little is known about public views on turnaround. We capitalize on a nationally representative 2017 survey (N = 4,214) to uncover opinions regarding which level of government should lead on turnaround and state takeover of troubled districts. We find controversy surrounding state intervention into low-performing schools is not driven by a generalized allegiance to local control over education. We observe high levels of support for state-level leadership in identifying and fixing failing schools, and even for state takeover of struggling districts. Instead, opposition appears to arise from the loss of local political and economic power, often experienced by majority-Black communities, that typically accompanies state takeover.
