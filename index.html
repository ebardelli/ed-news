  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: The Indonesian government has evaluated the research performance of universities, whose measurement process is projected into resources, management, outputs, and revenues to determine the provision of incentives, grants, and program funding to universities. However, efficiency calculations have shown that the outputs and competition-based incentives that drive scientific productivity are more complex. The most competitive systems must also be the most productive when considering resources. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the research efficiency in the Indonesian higher education system. Research Designs: The efficiency was analyzed by maximizing the 13 product outputs from the research budget and university staff. The result was then compared with the existing performance measurement analysis. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to evaluate the efficiency based on the data of 47 universities in the Mandiri cluster and 144 in the Utama cluster for the 2014–2018 period. Results: These findings showed that about 68% of universities have an efficiency value of 1 for the Mandiri group, almost 40% in the Utama group, and 41% for the two groups combined. Additionally, this study compared the efficiency analysis and the impact of the performance evaluation. Conclusions: The comparison showed that adding efficiency or productivity factors in the performance evaluation assessment produced a more accurate result.

  Abstract
                  <p>Given the significance of functional thinking as one of the main routes to foster early algebraic thinking, in this paper we describe how a current elementary mathematics textbook’s unit titled “Pattern and Correspondence” was developed in the Korean context. The following four key instructional elements for fostering functional thinking were extracted from the literature review: (a) correspondence relationships in real-life contexts; (b) various pattern tasks; (c) exploration for a correspondence relationship; and (d) symbol variables to represent a correspondence relationship. These elements were employed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the unit covering pattern and correspondence in the previous mathematics textbook. Based on this analysis, a new draft for the pattern and correspondence unit was designed and implemented in an elementary school to test its appropriateness and ability to enhance students’ functional thinking. Students’ responses using the new draft were analyzed in terms of the four elements. Performance between the students with the new draft and their counterparts with the previous textbook was compared. The students with the new draft were more successful than their counterparts in exploring and representing the relationship between two quantities. The final version of the unit was developed and has been applied to all schools. The whole process of developing the unit can be an example of how to foster functional thinking through changes to curricular resources.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The nature of the area of mathematical competitions as a design science is considered, historical roots of mathematical problem-solving competitions are traced, the complementary aspects of mathematics as theory building and as problem solving are touched upon in relation to the practice of competitions. Two historical figures, Euler and Erdős, emerge, and the appropriateness of many of Euler’s mathematical ventures are seen as role models for competition mathematics as first put into practice in mathematical competitions towards the end of the nineteenth century. Distinctions and definitions are made, a venture into identifying competition syllabi and the principal types of reasoning employed in solving competition problems is explored, and a description of the many different types of competitions is considered. Interaction between the field of mathematics itself and problem-solving competitions is briefly explored, as are the possibilities that open when competitions and their access to huge amounts of data, both national and international, are taken into account in research belonging to mathematics education. Finally, the range of topics addressed in this special issue of ZDM is covered, along with some possible conclusions relating to the components of the overview.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Within the commognitive perspective, ritual and explorative routines are used in a very particular way to distinguish students’ routines according to whether they are driven by social reward or by generating a substantiated narrative. Explorative routines in this theorisation may refer not to inquiry-based activity but to the result of a student’s routine moving from being process-oriented to becoming outcome-oriented, a deritualisation. Choice of tasks as well as a teacher’s moves offer students different opportunities to engage in rituals, explorative routines and deritualisations. Through nuancing the space spanned by opportunities to engage in rituals and explorative routines respectively, we describe and contrast classroom practices in three lessons from three contexts. The lessons share a commonality in encouraging explorative routines as a starting point, yet being adapted towards ritual activity through decreased openings for student agentivity, fewer invitations for students’ own substantiations or both. We argue that such adaptations are driven by the teachers’ commitment to reach mathematical closure in a lesson, to balance considerations of the classroom community and individual students and to meet curricular requirements. Our model helps interrogate the nature and relevance of hybrids of explorative routines and rituals.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Mathematical objects are the outcomes of human discourse and come to life through the process of objectification. Primary and concrete discursive objects (d-objects) play an important role in this process, forming different realizations through the objectification process. In the present study, we analyze the written discourses about the derivative at a point in fourteen Year 11 and Year 12 Iranian calculus textbooks over 42 years (1979–2020) in terms of primary objects, concrete d-objects, and the realizations used in them, here based on Sfard’s commognitive theory. The research method is a qualitative content analysis in which the analysis units were texts, examples, activities, and exercises in the textbooks. The results show that out of the 14 textbooks, only five included primary and concrete d-objects. The other textbooks only used abstract objects in their written discourse about the derivative. The pictures (visual mediators) that were used as primary objects gradually changed from schematic to real colored photos, and locally developed technologies and cultural elements were included in the new textbook editions. Additionally, the number of concrete d-objects increased in the new editions. In terms of the realizations, the number of roots also increased over time; however, none of the textbooks had all five main realizations (i.e., symbolic, graphical, verbal, numerical, and physical) for the derivative at a point. The realization tree developed as part of this study can be used as an analytical framework to analyze calculus textbooks in other contexts and can be used by teachers and lecturers to help students have explorative participation in discourse on the derivative.</p>

                    Abstract
                    <p>The transition from arithmetic to algebra in middle school can be critical for students having persistent difficulties in mathematics. The leading perception in our project is that holistic relational thinking is an effective problem-solving tool in both arithmetic and algebra. We worked in collaboration with two teachers of special classes to implement elements of this approach with Secondary I students. We implemented several problem-solving-related activities with students. We collected data through individual interviews with students before and after the intervention. Our data shows the positive effects of the intervention in students changing their strategies as well as overall success in solving word problems requiring relational analysis.</p>
                  
                  
                    Résumé
                    <p>Le passage de l’arithmétique à l’algèbre à l’école intermédiaire peut s’avérer déterminant pour les élèves qui éprouvent des difficultés persistantes en mathématiques. Le principe qui oriente notre projet suppose que la pensée relationnelle holistique est un outil de résolution de problème efficace à la fois en arithmétique et en algèbre. Nous avons travaillé en collaboration avec deux enseignants de classes d’éducation spécialisée de première année de l’enseignement secondaire afin de mettre en œuvre des éléments de l’approche relationnelle holistique. Durant cette intervention, nous avons présenté aux élèves plusieurs activités liées à la résolution de problèmes puis nous avons recueilli des données par le biais d’entrevues individuelles avant et après l’intervention. Nos résultats indiquent que l’intervention a eu, dans l’ensemble des effets positifs sur la façon dont les élèves composent avec les problèmes écrits. Nous avons relevé des changements dans les stratégies adoptées par les élèves ainsi que dans leur taux global de réussite pour résoudre les problèmes écrits qui requièrent de l’analyse relationnelle.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The objective of this work is to show an educational path for combinatorics and graph theory that has the aim, on one hand, of helping students understand some discrete mathematics properties, and on the other, of developing modelling skills through a robust understanding. In particular, for the path proposed to middle-school students, we used a connection between k-permutations and colourings of graphs: we indicated a way to solve problems related to counting all the possible arrangements of given objects in a k-tuple under given constraints. We solve this kind of problem by associating a graph with the constraints related to the k-tuple and by using graphs’ colourings, in which every colour is associated with one of the objects. The number of arrangements is given by finding the number of colourings through an algorithm called the Connection-Contraction Algorithm. The educational path is set within the Teaching for Robust Understanding framework and the goal, from the mathematical skills perspective, is to enhance modelling, passing from real situations (the fish problem in our experiment) to mathematical problems (the graph’s colouring in our experiment) and vice versa through the use of technology (the Connection-Contraction Algorithm with yEd editor, in our experiment), by using an extended modelling cycle. The meetings with students were videotaped and some results of the experimentation are given.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Our research aimed to investigate the potential learning benefits to young children of implementing digital interactive multimodal technologies that provide both visual and haptic experiences in elementary mathematics classrooms. We studied the ways in which fourth-grade students collaboratively create collective strategies for solving mathematical problems utilizing dynamic geometry software with multi-touch interfaces, a combination we call a multi-touch Dynamic Geometry Environment. We examine in-depth two case studies each illustrating how mathematical strategies, collaboration, and socially mediated metacognition emerge in the small groups of children while working on an activity using the Geometer’s Sketchpad® on the iPad to make sense of an intuitive idea of covariation. We found that children’s interactions with their peers, the interviewer, and the mDGE favored the emergence of varied collaborative behaviors and socially mediated metacognitive processes that fostered the co-construction and development of mathematical strategies over a short period of time.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Technological innovation and its paradigm, that is, the Fourth Industrial Revolution-4IR, have shown strong impact on income levels of adopters across the globe. To this end, this analysis examines the impact of bank funding and institutional quality on technological advancement. Objectives: This study adds additional variables such as high-technology exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) as control variable. Our study period spans from 2000 to 2018 on an annual frequency for E7 economies (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, India, Turkey, Russia, and China). Research Design: This study leverages on cross-sectional ARDL, Augmented Mean Group (AMG), and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group Estimates (CCEMG) estimation techniques to examine long-run relationship between the outlined variables. Subjects: Empirical findings show that institution quality, bank finance, income, high-technology exports, and foreign direct investments exert a positive effect on advancements in technology. Furthermore, the interaction between bank finance and institution quality on technological advancement is also positive and statistically significant. Based on the findings, it is concluded that large-scale funding is crucial for businesses to leverage revolutionary technology. Likewise, access to large capital sources if made easier encourages technology affordance as well as innovation and operational excellence. Thus, economies with established legal and financial systems stand to offer businesses such security, which encourages business innovation. Conclusions: Consequently, E7 economies ought to improve their financial and legal systems to boost financial security, creativity, and competitiveness of businesses.

  Abstract
                  <p>Despite the challenges that primary historical sources present for students and instructors alike, engaging students with such sources as part of their mathematical learning experiences is an increasingly common instructional practice. Yet research on teaching and learning with primary sources remains a niche activity. It is thus reasonable to ask whether the use of primary sources merits broader attention from the mathematics education community. This article explores this question through the lens of Sfard’s commognitive theory of learning, which views mathematics as a discourse and mathematical learning as the process of becoming a participant in that discourse. Importantly, commognitive tenets apply to interpretations of mathematical development at both the historical and individual levels. I use these tenets to analyze a particular type of student project that adopts a guided reading approach to primary sources. Specifically, I examine examples of such projects that have been developed and used in the US to teach core mathematical topics at the university level since 2003, using commognitive theory to characterize the potential learning opportunities they afford. As with all instructional materials, these opportunities can be missed in classroom implementation. Nevertheless, the discourses represented in different instructional materials render some learning opportunities easier to offer students, while constraining the possibility of others. I thus also briefly examine some of the differences between these primary source projects and the standard textbooks that they are intended to replace.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, drawing on the philosophy of dialectical materialism, we present an elaboration of two concepts that tend to remain backstage in debates in the field of history in mathematics education, namely, the concept of mathematics learning and the concept of classroom mathematics knowledge. The elaboration of these two concepts makes room to return to the longstanding question of the role of history in mathematics education. We argue that the history of mathematics in education is not a choice but a need—a central part of the process of understanding our human nature as essentially historical and cultural. We illustrate these ideas through the analysis of the encounter of a group of prospective teachers with a 14th century problem about motion. In this encounter the students engaged critically in conversations with voices of the past, while restoring the aesthetic, ethical, and historical dimensions of knowing and learning.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The transition to fully or partially online instruction for K–12 students necessitated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the current lack of understanding of practices that support K–12 student learning in online settings in emergency situations but also, more troublingly, in K–12 online teaching and learning more generally. A systematic review of literature regarding K–12 online teaching and learning in the United States was therefore conducted to begin to fill this gap and to inform the work of policy makers, researchers, teacher educators, teachers, and administrators as they negotiate the changing role of online instruction in our nation’s educational systems. The review revealed a set of contextual conditions that are foundational to student learning in K–12 online settings (prepared educators, technology access and autonomy, students’ developmental needs and abilities, and students’ self-regulated learning skills). The literature also pointed to seven pillars of instructional practice that support student learning in these settings (evidence-based course organization and design, connected learners, accessibility, supportive learning environment, individualization, active learning, and real-time assessment).

  Abstract
                  <p>While reports of teachers’ use of curriculum materials are common, that of teachers as designers of their own materials are far less so. We argue that these (rare) instructional materials, defined as materials that are classroom-ready and that carry the teachers’ actual instructional goals, are ‘objects’ that are suitable as records of teachers’ planning and learning when developed alongside professional development. We provide supporting evidence of this claim and unpack the complexities of interacting instructional goals through a case study of a teacher who (re-)designed her own instructional materials as she participated in professional development. From the findings of the case, we reflect on the educational and methodological implications of pursing this research approach.

  Abstract
                  <p>According to expectancy-value models, two important motivational constructs are task value and self-efficacy expectations. As students work intensively on mathematical problems in the classroom, teachers need the competence to judge whether students value solving the problem and how confident they are that they will succeed. However, not much is known about the mechanisms behind teachers’ judgments concerning students’ motivation. The goal of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (a) How do preservice teachers rate their own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (b) Are there differences in preservice teachers’ diagnostic judgments concerning school students’ task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (c) Do preservice teachers’ own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems differ from preservice teachers’ judgments of school students’ task value and self-efficacy? A total of 182 preservice teachers were asked about the value of 12 problems, their confidence in solving the problems, and how hypothetical ninth graders would judge these constructs. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own perceptions regarding both constructs were lower for modelling problems than for other problems. When judging school students’ motivation, ratings of both constructs were higher for word problems. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own motivation were significantly higher across all types of problems than their judgments of school students’ perspectives. A positive correlation between preservice teachers’ own motivation and their judgments of school students’ motivation indicates the importance of teachers’ perceptions of their own motivation to solve mathematical problems for diagnostic judgments.</p>
