  Abstract
                    <p>Understanding of the equal sign is associated with early algebraic competence in the elementary grades and equation-solving success in middle school. Thus, it is important to find ways to build foundational understanding of the equal sign as a relational symbol. Past work promoted a conception of the equal sign as meaning “the same as”. However, recent work highlights another dimension of relational understanding—a substitutive conception, which emphasizes the idea that an expression can be substituted for another equivalent one. This work suggests a substitutive conception may support algebra performance above and beyond a sameness conception alone. In this paper, we share a subset of results from an online intervention designed to foster a relational understanding of the equal sign among fourth and fifth graders (n = 146). We compare lessons focused on a sameness conception alone and a dual sameness and substitutive conception to each other, and we compare both to a control condition. The lessons influenced students’ likelihood of producing and endorsing sameness and substitutive definitions of the equal sign. However, the impact of the lessons on students’ approaches to missing value equations was less clear. We discuss possible interpretations, and we argue that further research is needed to explore the roles of sameness and substitutive views of the equal sign in supporting structural approaches to algebraic equation solving.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study forms part of a classroom teaching experiment on the development of a group of 25 9–10 years old students’ algebraic thinking. More specifically, it explored their reasoning while solving word problems built around functional relationships to determine how they generalized through questions posed using natural language, drawn figures or the keyword ‘many’. Their written and oral answers to those questions were analyzed qualitatively to determine which approach most effectively supported the expression of their generalization. The results reveal the benefits of posing questions about the general case in different ways while teaching students to use conventional algebraic representations. According to these findings, representing indeterminate quantities with the keyword ‘many’ induces generalization more successfully than representing them with letters. The use of letters prompts students to seek meaning for the letters, either conventionally, as an unknown or variable quantity, or otherwise, as a label or specific values assigned according to their own criteria. Identifying the most effective procedures may help teachers and curriculum designers formulate mathematical tasks that encourage students to express the generality they perceive in particular cases. Determining the communication demands of each approach is likewise highly useful.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper we consider implications of the current world-wide inclusion of computational thinking in relation to children’s development of algebraic thinking. Little is known about how newly developed visual programming environments such as Scratch could enhance early algebra learning. The study is based on examples of programming activities used by mathematics teachers in Sweden, teaching students aged 10–12 years during the first two years of implementing programming in the mathematics curriculum. Informed by Chevallard’s praxeology in terms of praxis and logos, we describe, unpack, discuss and expand these activities. Core issues related to algebra found in the three activities are as follows: making implicit variables explicit; using a counter variable; and identifying parameters as a specific type of variable. Our findings show that, in addition to already identified uses of variables in early algebra, programming activities in the early years bring in new aspects and new ways of treating variables that could, potentially, enhance students’ understanding of variables and generalization, provided that programming praxis is embedded in an appropriate algebra logos.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>A key aspect of young children’s development of algebraic reasoning is the process of visualising and identifying structures to both abstract and generalise. There has been a growing body of research focused on how students form generalisations, this article adds to the existing body of research by examining how young culturally diverse students identify mathematical structures in contextual growing patterns and the teaching and learning actions that assist them to generalise. Data were collected from one classroom of 29 Year Two (6 years old) students in a low socio-economic school in New Zealand. Results from the analysis of lessons related to two tasks showed that the contextual tasks led students to notice different mathematical structures. Specific pedagogical actions were used to facilitate students’ engagement with the growing patterns. These included positioning students to engage with different representations (pictorial and numerical, tabular, and natural language) to represent thinking, the use of classroom discussions, noticing and responding to student thinking, and pressing students to find far terms. The findings highlight that both the contextual patterning tasks and teacher actions supported the young students to develop a range of sophisticated generalisations related to the underlying mathematical structure and functional relationships of the growing patterns.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Relational thinking and dealing with variables are two essential aspects of algebraic thinking. Relational thinking means viewing mathematical expressions and equations as a whole rather than as individual computing processes. It is characterized by using relationships between mathematical objects, and refers to the relations of equality and inequality. In this study, to examine the relational thinking of kindergarten and primary school children, this perspective was applied using non-symbolic representations in the form of boxes and marbles. Using multiple variables is a very powerful but also difficult tool of algebra. The study had the aim of examining how kindergarten children and primary school children establish relationships between several variables which are represented with real materials. The interview study was conducted with children aged 5–10 years. Marbles and different colored boxes represented equations with unknowns and quantities depending on each other. Initially, two approaches could be differentiated, namely, number-oriented and structure-oriented approaches. It could be shown that certain conceptualizations of variables were related to children’s ability to show relational thinking. Kindergarteners are stimulated to think relationally by unknown quantities which can be determined. This process was observed in primary school children dealing with quantities that depended on each other. In addition, the conceptualization of the variables represented as boxes was examined. The concepts of general number and variable as changing quantity were categorized. Further conceptualizations resulted from the interview data, namely, categories of the undeterminable, the specific number, and the quasi-general.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This article addresses the nature of student-generated representations that support students’ early algebraic reasoning in the realm of generalized arithmetic. We analyzed representations created by students for the following qualities: representations that distinguish the behavior of one operation from another, that support an explanation of a specific case of a generalization, and that support justification of a generalization. One key finding is that representations in the form of pictures, diagrams, arrangements of manipulatives, or story contexts that embody the meaning of the operation(s) allow students to distinguish between operations. Such representations can be used by young students to illustrate relationships conveyed in specific instances of a general claim. Further, extending these representations to class of numbers is a mechanism for proving a general claim.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we elaborate the seeds of algebraic thinking perspective, drawing upon Knowledge in Pieces as a heuristic epistemological framework. We argue that students’ pre-instructional experiences in early childhood lay the foundation for algebraic thinking and are a largely untapped resource in developing students’ algebraic thinking in the classroom. We theorize that seeds of algebraic thinking are cognitive resources abstracted over many interactions with the world in children’s pre-instructional experience. Further, we provide examples to demonstrate how the same seeds of algebraic thinking present in early childhood can be invoked in reasoning across contexts, grade levels, and different levels of formality of algebraic instruction. The examples demonstrate how the seeds perspective differs from other accounts of the relationship between children’s early activity and their engagement in algebraic reasoning processes. We anticipate this new theoretical direction for characterizing the nature and development of algebraic thinking will lay the foundation for a robust agenda that sheds light on the development of algebraic thinking and informs algebra instruction, particularly how teachers notice and respond to children’s developing algebraic thinking.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>“They are the same” is a phrase that teachers often hear from their students in arithmetic and algebra. But what do students mean when they say this? The present paper researches the notion of sameness within algebraic thinking in the context of generating equivalent numerical equalities. A group of Grade 6 Mexican students (10- to 12-year-olds) was presented with tasks that required transforming the given numerical equalities in such a way as to show their truth-value. The students initially indicated this by calculating and demonstrating that the total was the same on both sides. When asked not to calculate, their approaches evolved into more structural transformations involving decomposition so as to arrive at an equality with the same expression on each side. Students used the language of sameness—both visible and invisible—to describe the truth-value of their transformed expressions and equalities. The visible sameness referred to the resulting identical form of each side of the equality and the invisible sameness to the top–down equivalences that they had generated by their decomposing transformations—both types of sameness being characterized by their hidden numerical values. These findings suggest implications for transitioning to the algebraic domain of equations with their similarly hidden values.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Given the significance of functional thinking as one of the main routes to foster early algebraic thinking, in this paper we describe how a current elementary mathematics textbook’s unit titled “Pattern and Correspondence” was developed in the Korean context. The following four key instructional elements for fostering functional thinking were extracted from the literature review: (a) correspondence relationships in real-life contexts; (b) various pattern tasks; (c) exploration for a correspondence relationship; and (d) symbol variables to represent a correspondence relationship. These elements were employed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the unit covering pattern and correspondence in the previous mathematics textbook. Based on this analysis, a new draft for the pattern and correspondence unit was designed and implemented in an elementary school to test its appropriateness and ability to enhance students’ functional thinking. Students’ responses using the new draft were analyzed in terms of the four elements. Performance between the students with the new draft and their counterparts with the previous textbook was compared. The students with the new draft were more successful than their counterparts in exploring and representing the relationship between two quantities. The final version of the unit was developed and has been applied to all schools. The whole process of developing the unit can be an example of how to foster functional thinking through changes to curricular resources.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Functional thinking is an established route into algebra. However, the learning mechanisms that support the transition from arithmetic to functional thinking remain unclear. In the current study we explored children’s pre-instructional intuitive reactions to functional thinking content, relying on a conceptual change perspective and using mixed methods. The sample included 20 grade 3 students and 24 grade 5 students. First, we assessed children’s arithmetic skills and intuitive responses to generalisation tasks involving variation tables. The quantitative analysis showed that students’ arithmetic skills correlated with functional aspects such as the following: identifying, and expressing function rules with words but not with the symbolic expression of function rules. The qualitative analysis revealed that students constructed framework theories that generated different intuitive conceptions of the algebraic ideas involved in noticing and expressing generalisation. Students’ conflicts were concentrated in areas that determine key differences between arithmetic and algebra, such as generalisation, indeterminate quantities, and variable notation. We discuss how these results contribute to explaining the construction of algebra concepts.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this study we aimed to inquire into the impact of the use of early arithmetic strategies by a group of fifth-grade students, on their solving of equations involving two representations of unknowns. Pre- and post-tests consisting of equation-solving items involving two representations of unknowns (number sentences containing empty ‘brackets’, as in the example 5 + (∙) = 10, or equations containing x, as in 5 + x = 10), were administered to 126 fifth-grade students in a regular class setting. We found a notable difference between students’ success rates on these two types of equations and their strategy use. Most students used the inversing strategy (arithmetic operations) after formal instruction on equation solving. Several students even used both the inversing and formal strategies (performing the same operation on both sides) for the same equation. When the unknown x appeared as the subtrahend or the divisor, the success rate dropped dramatically, and students tried to use the formal solving method of performing the same operation on both sides to solve such equations. The findings of this study not only suggest how teachers can be sensitive to students’ different interpretations of unknowns, but also highlight the importance of using students’ prior sense making to teach equation solving and of helping students gain an in-depth understanding of equation solving and representations of unknowns.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Under Florida’s developmental education (DE) reform since 2014, recent public high school graduates and active-duty military personnel became exempt from DE and traditional placement tests. The legislation also required colleges to provide accelerated instruction strategies for students remaining in DE and offer enhanced advising and support services for all incoming students. Focusing on the differential policy impacts on exempt and nonexempt students, we used statewide administrative data to examine changes in first-year completion rates for gateway math and English courses before and after the reform. Overall, and for those deemed to be college-ready, nonexempt students benefited more from the reform; however, the opposite is true for students who were not college-ready, with exempt students benefiting more. This study confirms that each component of the reform has played a role in contributing to its success.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>School integration and inclusion are important for educational equity, yet inclusionary educational policies often end up being exclusionary in practices. In this article I contribute to our understanding of school level mechanism underlying this process. I draw on 2 years of data collection in a progressive culturally responsive school implementing a voluntary students assignment policy to increase the share of low-income students of color in the school. I show how a conflict with dissenting mothers over gender-unlabeled bathrooms became a conflict over the meaning of inclusion when school leaders applied deficit thinking that saw low-income parents of color as less likely to support the program, despite heterogeneity in dissenting mothers’ background, and how as result dissenting mothers felt excluded from the school community and the needs of transgender students were unmet. These findings have important implications for theory and practice and for creating inclusive schools.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Although antiracism activism has contributed to substantive progress under certain circumstances and in certain contexts, little research attempts to theorize how antiracism activism is manifest across contexts. In this article, we explore individual and collective antiracist actions within and outside schools. We introduce a theoretical framework that identifies four domains of activism—policy, community, leadership, and teaching and learning—in which activists operate to make a positive difference in promoting racial equity and antiracism in education. The framework offers a systemic way of thinking about antiracist activism in education and the importance of recognizing that several aspects of antiracist activism usually conceived as distinct are interrelated within and across domains. Indeed, antiracist education activism must be understood holistically and systemically if we seek to dismantle the racism that is woven into every piece of the education system.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we discuss the theoretical background of mathematical modelling and its connection to citizenship education. Citizenship education in this context means that young people are equipped with competencies to respond as responsible citizens in situations relevant for society. To outline the connection between mathematical modelling and citizenship education in theory, we discuss the aims of mathematical modelling, modelling competences and the connection between numeracy and modelling. Based on these reflections we present an extended modelling cycle that specifically highlights modelling steps relevant to citizenship education. To show how the theoretical connection between mathematical modelling and citizenship education can be used in teaching practice, we describe three different examples of modelling tasks and analyse them with the help of the extended modelling cycle. We argue that the three tasks support different learning aims in relation to citizenship education and require modellers to carry out different steps of the extended modelling cycle. As an example of context, we used the pandemic caused by COVID-19, as it affected the quality of human life greatly, as all students in the Western world experienced.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we discuss the zoom in and zoom out approach to mathematics teacher education (ZIZO), which is intentionally designed to foster commognitive conflicts through the exploration of historical sources and the engagement with collective discussions. ZIZO is structured in three interconnected moments: firstly, participants are invited to immerse in primary sources, as a means of shaking their comfort zones regarding legitimate mathematical procedures and criteria; secondly, they engage in plenary discussions on the historical contextualisation of mathematical ideas, supported by the study of secondary sources; finally, they return to the source to unveil specific aspects of historical practices. This approach is part of a broader proposal, which builds upon participants’ collective experiences to stimulate the development of a problematising stance toward knowledge production and teaching of mathematics. We exemplify ZIZO by a case in which the study of books I and II of Euclid’s Elements was used to problematise usual approaches to the teaching of Pythagoras’ theorem and areas in Brazilian secondary school. Our findings suggest that the engagement with Euclidean practices led teachers to problematise their views on the teaching of areas as geometrical magnitudes and as measurements, as well as the pedagogical uses of manipulable materials. These results highlight ZIZO’s potential for teacher education, especially regarding the problematisation of views on what mathematics is and how it is learned and taught.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Uncertainty is an overarching aspect of life that is particularly pertinent to the present COVID-19 pandemic crisis; as seen by the pandemic’s rapid worldwide spread, the nature and level of uncertainty have possibly increased due to the possible disconnects across national borders. The entire economy, especially the tourism industry, has been dramatically impacted by COVID-19. In the current study, we explore the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and pandemic uncertainty (PU) on inbound international tourism by using data gathered from Italy, Spain, and the United States for the years 1995–2021. Using the Quantile on Quantile (QQ) approach, the study confirms that EPU and PU negatively affected inbound tourism in all states. Wavelet-based Granger causality further reveals bi-directional causality running from EPU to inbound tourism and unidirectional causality from PU to inbound tourism in the long run. The overall findings show that COVID-19 has had a strong negative effect on tourism. So resilient skills are required to restore a sustainable tourism industry.
