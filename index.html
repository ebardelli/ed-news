  Abstract
                  <p>This article is a review of the literature on the use of history of mathematics in combination with use of digital technologies in the teaching and learning of mathematics. The review identifies 33 peer-reviewed publications (book chapters, journal articles, and papers in conference proceedings) that address an actual interplay between use of history and digital technologies. Of these, 24 concern the use of primary historical source material, i.e., mathematical texts produced by past (historical) mathematicians. Besides asking the questions of which publications actually incorporate this interplay and what purposes the use of history and digital technology serve, we also address the question of the role of mathematics education theoretical perspectives (or the lack thereof) in the identified publications. A reading of the identified publications shows that the ones involving use of primary historical source material often have a clearer connection to theoretical constructs from mathematics education research (outside the area of History and Pedagogy of Mathematics, or HPM). Still, only a small number of the identified publications make use of mathematics education theoretical constructs specifically addressing the use of digital technology.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Only a quarter of full-time U.S. students complete their desired goal from community college attendance, with the rate of success even lower for Latinx students. This panel-data regression study looks for evidence regarding the expected influence of increasing the presence of Latinx faculty or administrators on cohort completion rates for all students, only Latinx students, and sub-samples of these two cohort types divided further by economic advantage or college preparation. We find that a one-percentage-point increase in Latinx faculty among full-time instructors or a similar increase in Latinx representation among administrators positively influences nearly all cohort completion rates.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>ObjectivesThis study aims to empirically test the smooth adjustment hypothesis (SAH) in the Portuguese labour market during 2000–2018, considering changes in employment, wage, productivity, consumption and the marginal intra-industry trade.Research DesignSo, following the literature, a greater marginal intra-industry trade intensity should reduce adverse shocks expressed in temporary inefficiencies such as undesirable job search costs and workers’ relocation and retraining. According to state of the art, our research strategy considered a battery of diagnosis tests about the random generating process of variables included in a dynamic panel data model.MethodsThe extensive work developed in this paper is a further step to introduce recent techniques such as the Method of Moments Quantile Regression and the cointegration panel models to infer long-term dynamics.Results and ConclusionsOverall, the main point is that we find evidence confirming the hypothesis mentioned above, showing that mutual interactions reduce adverse shocks above mentioned. Thus, the study demonstrates that the marginal intra-industry trade promotes smooth adjustment in the Portuguese economy.

                  <p>This paper presents data from the first of three iterations of teaching experiments conducted with secondary teachers. The purpose of the experiments was to investigate how teachers’ combinatorial reasoning could support their development of algebraic structure, specifically structural relationships between the roots and coefficients of polynomials. The data in this paper examines the learning that occurred as one teacher transitioned from making a generalization from a sequence of contextualized combinatorics problems to applying her combinatorial reasoning to symbolic problems common in algebra curricula. The findings from the study include the identification of three planes of learning that can be used to differentiate among ways that combinatorial reasoning can be used to engage in binomial expansion. The highest plane involved constructing a combinatorial scheme for binomial expansion, a scheme that supported the teacher to produce the equivalence, 
                    
                    \(\left(x+a\right)\left(x+b\right)\left(x+c\right)={x}^{3}+\left(a+b+c\right){x}^{2}+\left(ab+ac+bc\right)x+abc\)
                    
                  ), and to see important algebraic structure in it. The contributions of the study include: (a) expanding earlier arguments about the ways that combinatorics can be integrated into goals of extant curricula (e.g., Maher et al. in Combinatorics and reasoning: Representing, justifying and building isomorphisms. Springer, 2011); and (b) proposing how reflecting abstraction can be used to study the transition between generalizations learners make from contextualized problem situations to operating with and on generalizations expressed with  conventional algebraic symbols. This second contribution is an under-researched area in the algebra literature (Dörfler in ZDM - Int J Math Educ 40(1):143–160, 2008), and points to an important role that combinatorial reasoning can play in algebra learning.</p>

                  <p>In this article, we report on a typology of the demands of statistical and mathematical products (StaMPs) embedded in media items related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The typology emerged from a content analysis of a large purposive sample of diverse media items selected from digital news sources based in four countries. The findings encompass nine categories of StaMPs: (1) descriptive quantitative information, (2) models, predictions, causality and risk, (3) representations and displays, (4) data quality and strength of evidence, (5) demographics and comparative thinking, (6) heterogeneity and contextual factors, (7) literacy and language demands, (8) multiple information sources, and (9) critical demands. We illustrate these categories via selected media items, substantiate them through relevant research literature, and point to categories that encompass new or enhanced types of demands. Our findings offer insights into the rich set of capabilities that citizens (including both young people and adults) must possess in order to engage these mass media demands, critically analyze statistical and mathematical information in the media, evaluate the meaning and credibility of news reports, understand public policies, and make evidenced-informed judgments. Our conclusions point to the need to revise current curricular frameworks and conceptual models (e.g., regarding statistical and probability literacy, adult numeracy), to better incorporate notions such as blended knowledge, vagueness, risk, strength of evidence, and criticality. Furthermore, more attention is needed to the literacy and language demands of media items involving statistical and mathematical information. Implications for further research and educational practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>It is well established that spatial reasoning skills (i) support mathematics achievement, (ii) are malleable, and (iii) can be improved through training. More recently, there has been interest in using spatial training to causally support corresponding improvements in mathematics achievement; however, findings so far appear to be mixed. The current study explores the effect of a spatial reasoning intervention on Year 11 students’ spatial reasoning skills and mathematics achievement and considers the role of a pedagogical framework and the multidimensional nature of mathematics and spatial reasoning in the design of the intervention. The Experience-Language-Pictorial-Symbolic-Application (ELPSA) pedagogical framework was used to modify an existing spatial intervention program for delivery by high-school educators to Year 11 students (an important but understudied population). The spatial intervention involved training a range of spatial skills over an extended timeframe. Students were randomly assigned to the intervention condition or to a business-as-usual control (n = 73). Using a pre-/post-test design, we found the intervention was successful in improving participants’ spatial reasoning skills and performance on measurement and geometry items compared to the control condition but not on number and algebra items. These findings demonstrate that spatial training can support mathematics achievement in certain contexts, highlighting the importance of identifying how individual spatial skills support specific mathematics tasks. Consideration was given for how to use strong pedagogical techniques to scaffold transfer, finding utility in the ELPSA framework. Implications for how to embed spatial training within real mathematics classrooms, as done in the current study, are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper attempts to deepen our understanding of teachers’ selection and modification of mathematical tasks for their classroom instruction. In this paper, we focus on teachers’ orientations and resources that subtly influence teachers’ choices during their routine undertaking of task selection and modification. Interviews using stimulus material were used to induce teachers to expound their thought process as they deliberated the suitability of tasks and made choices related to task selection and modification. These thought processes are critical as it provides potential explanation for teachers’ task inclinations. The findings of this study show that whilst beliefs of the teaching and learning of mathematics and beliefs of students’ capabilities and capacities are preponderant as the teachers deliberate on which tasks they would use, the orientations within these beliefs differ amongst them. These orientations, productive or unproductive, influence their decisions during task selection and modification. Teacher resource specific to mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) is also critical in impacting teachers’ choice of tasks. Teacher orientations and expertise impact the range and extent the teachers draw on their MKT, resulting in dissimilar inclinations towards tasks for mathematics instruction. In addition, resources such as preparation time, curriculum time and materials teachers have at hand influence their choices when selecting and modifying mathematical tasks for instruction.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>In this article, we argue that healing from trauma in a racialized context requires an act of collective, critical resistance whereby educators and researchers reject a White-dominant colonial perspective of trauma on the grounds that it is pathologizing in several ways. We introduce a holistic trauma framework for understanding and responding to trauma within a racialized context. First, our framework seeks to draw on multiple forms of knowledge and experience to gain a deeper sense of trauma, suffering, and healing. Second, it uses an organic approach to promote relationships and support healing. Third, our framework explores multiple timepoints by introducing proactive, interactive, and reactive approaches for addressing trauma more comprehensively. We hope our framework will enhance the field of trauma research, which is, at present, overpopulated by White-dominant, colonial perspectives that mask systemic racial inequities.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>An important way to address the literacy needs of English learners (ELs) is to ensure that ELs receive evidence-based literacy instruction and intervention. To support teachers’ implementation of this instruction and intervention, it is necessary to provide effective professional development (PD). In this systematic review, we synthesized 19 studies that investigated PD on literacy instruction and intervention for ELs. Findings revealed that although PD often targets teachers’ implementation of literacy instruction, PD is less likely to focus on teachers’ implementation of literacy interventions for ELs experiencing reading difficulties. Nonetheless, PD programs typically resulted in positive changes in teachers’ knowledge and practices. However, only 12 of the studies reported on student outcomes. We conclude with research and practical implications related to PD for teachers of ELs that is responsive to the needs of ELs.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the research reported in this paper, using a modified version of the interconnected model of teacher professional growth (IMTPG) proposed by Clarke and Hollingsworth (Teaching Teacher Educ 18:947–967, 2002), we aimed to understand the learning dynamics in a lesson study of a group of five teachers of grades 5–6, during their work around mathematical tasks and in the elaboration and analysis of a diagnostic test of students’ knowledge. We draw on examples from a lesson study that took place in a school in Lisbon, involving five teachers that constituted the whole mathematics group of the school. The main feature of our adaptation is the consideration of a Group Domain instead of the Personal Domain of the original model. In the original model, the Domain of Practice had a broad definition but usually it was restricted to classroom experimentation. In the research reported in this paper, the lesson study sessions were taken as part of the Domain of Practice. For data collection, there was audio and video recording of the lesson study sessions and of the research lesson and the writing of a research journal. Data analysis was done using the modified IMTPG. The results suggest that this model is helpful in understanding the processes that make lesson study a valuable professional development setting, contributing to responding to the question of ‘how lesson study works’ (Lewis et al., Theory and practices of lesson study in mathematics: an international perspective, Springer, New York, 2019). In addition, the use of this model showed that the lesson study promoted the teachers’ development regarding knowledge of didactics, especially knowledge of students and their learning processes and of teaching practice.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Drawing bar diagrams has been shown to improve performance on mathematical word problems wherein the relational keyword is consistent with the required arithmetic operation. This study extends this by testing the effectiveness of bar diagram drawing for word problems with an inconsistent keyword-arithmetic operation mapping. Seventy-five fifth graders solved consistent and inconsistent word problems while encouraged to draw bar diagrams. For each word problem, we assessed problem type (consistent/inconsistent), performance (correct/incorrect), and bar diagrams (accurate/inaccurate/no drawing). Overall, bar diagram drawing was associated with increased performance on both consistent and inconsistent word problems, but the strongest benefits of drawing were found for inconsistent word problems. For inconsistent word problems, bar diagram accuracy was more clearly related to performance (accurate bar diagrams related to correct answers, but inaccurate ones to incorrect answers) than for consistent word problems. We conclude that bar diagram drawing provides an effective graphical support for solving inconsistent word problems.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite substantial evidence of the effectiveness of—and the need for—culturally relevant education (CRE), it has been treated by many schools as a professional choice or new initiative rather than a fundamental approach to teaching in a multicultural, democratic society. Moreover, efforts to implement CRE across schools and districts have recently been met by strong opposition from well-organized groups. In this essay, the authors point to scientific, legal, and ethical arguments for why CRE should be considered a noncontroversial, evidence-based approach to education. The authors then draw on insights from political psychology and critical Whiteness studies to argue that the opposition to CRE is unlikely to be overcome through the evidence they present. The arguments therefore are meant not to convince critics but rather to bolster educational leaders’ resolve to stand strong in the face of opposition. The authors conclude with specific recommendations for how districts might begin the work of institutionalizing CRE so that the approach ultimately becomes taken for granted and alternatives cease to be considered.

                  <p>Undergraduate students are expected to produce and comprehend constructive existence proofs; yet, these proofs are notoriously difficult for students. This study investigates students’ thinking about these proofs by asking students to validate two arguments for the existence of a mathematical object. The first argument featured a common structural error while the second was a valid argument of the claim. We found that the students often considered the logical structures of the arguments when validating them. They provided reasons for their evaluations, including why they thought the structure of the first argument functioned to prove the claim and why they thought the structure of the second argument did not function to prove the claim. We discuss how these reasons provide insights into why constructive existence proofs might be challenging for students. We end the paper with implications for the teaching and learning of constructive existence proofs and their proof frameworks.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Integration is an important, albeit difficult, goal of science and mathematics education. This paper presents a framework and a research design proposal to identify preservice teachers’ (PSTs) integration performance of science and mathematics (IPoSM). It also presents the classification of PSTs’ level of integration in each phase of a problem-based learning (PBL) activity, within the proposed framework, and evidence of their work. The framework is organized in three levels of integration, based on current research, and detailed with specific integration indicators about an exemplary PBL activity, named STEM Bees. This PBL activity was structured as a research problem divided into two integrated problems. A qualitative methodology was used, focused on the application of the framework to the work of PSTs in that PBL activity. The final participants were 13 PSTs, organized in four working groups. In general, results show that PSTs’ integration performance was higher with the second problem than with the first problem. However, full integration with meaningful connections between science and mathematics ideas was achieved by almost all PST at the conclusion of the research problem. The IPoSM framework indicators proved to be useful for identifying the level of integration of science and mathematics in PSTs’ work in each phase of the PBL activity. Keeping the IPoSM framework in mind, teacher educators could elaborate more effective problem-based integrated approaches of science and mathematics in initial teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Constantly on the lookout for Canadian mathematics education matters, I recently experienced a major personal tipping point. The juxtaposition of two different customer service situations was simply too much for me to handle. Now through the looking glass, it was abundantly clear that tipping in Canada is unconscious, and the evidence was everywhere. The current state of financial literacy education in Canadian schools, the opportunity that COVID-19 has provided for us to renew Canada’s implied gratuity guidelines, and an investigation into pre- and post-tax bill totals all supported my assertion that the tipping culture in Canada is a habit in many senses of the word. A look back at how tipping in Canada has evolved from parting with a few coins every once and a while, and a look at the evolution of the point of sale terminal, which I refer to as ‘The Machine’, helped me realize that I am unable to move on and start looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters just yet. After all, if Canadian mathematics education matters, then Canadian mathematics education matters. As such, Part II of this article follows in the next issue. Stay tuned.</p>
