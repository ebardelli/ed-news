  Abstract
                  <p>In this reflective methodological paper we focus on affordances and challenges of video data. We compare and analyze two research settings that use the latest video technology to capture classroom interactions in mathematics education, namely, The Social Unit of Learning (SUL) project of the University of Melbourne and the MathTrack project of the University of Helsinki. While using these two settings as examples, we have structured our reflections around themes pertinent to video research in general, namely, research methods, data management, and research ethics. SUL and MathTrack share an understanding of mathematics learning as social multimodal practice, and provide possibilities for zooming into the situational micro interactions that construct collaborative problem-solving learning. Both settings provide rich data for in-depth analyses of peer interactions and learning processes. The settings share special needs for technical support and data management, as well as attention to ethical aspects from the perspective of the participants’ security and discretion. SUL data are especially suitable for investigating interactions on a broad scope, addressing how multiple interactional processes intertwine. MathTrack, on the other hand, enables exploration of participants’ visual attention in detail and its role in learning. Both settings could provide tools for teachers’ professional development by showing them aspects of classroom interactions that would otherwise remain hidden.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we report the results of a study in which we investigated how formal education and shadow education in Taiwan provide students opportunities to learn mathematics. Based on the conceptual framework of Opportunity to Learn (OTL), aspects specific to formal education, including mathematics curriculum, mathematics textbooks, and teachers’ competence, and their teaching, were reviewed. Two national projects identified under shadow education were examined. The results revealed significant features of the mathematics curriculum, textbook design, and the quality of mathematics teachers in Taiwan that constitute a lived space where teachers with their knowledge and beliefs, curriculum, textbooks, and school settings, can generate cognitive and affective learning outcomes in students. Further analyses of the two above-mentioned projects showed how Taiwan extended learning opportunities to motivate students to learn and understand school mathematics. Based on the review, challenges were also identified.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Examining teachers’ knowledge on a large scale involves addressing substantial measurement and logistical issues; thus, existing teacher knowledge assessments have mainly consisted of selected-response items because of their ease of scoring. Although open-ended responses could capture a more complex understanding of and provide further insights into teachers’ thinking, scoring these responses is expensive and time consuming, which limits their use in large-scale studies. In this study, we investigated whether a novel statistical approach, topic modeling, could be used to score teachers’ open-ended responses and if so, whether these scores would capture nuances of teachers’ understanding. To test this hypothesis, we used topic modeling to analyze teachers’ responses to a proportional reasoning task and examined the associations of the topics identified through this method with categories identified by a separate qualitative analysis of the same data as well as teachers’ performance on a measure of ratios and proportional relationships. Our findings suggest that topic modeling seemed to capture nuances of teachers’ responses and that such nuances differentiated teachers’ performance on the same concept. We discuss the implications of this study for education research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics coaching is complex work, and coaches must be supported to become experts in mathematics, mathematics instruction, and mathematics coaching. Using video and interview data from 12 mathematics coaches and one district administrator in one public school district in the southeastern USA, this qualitative study explores how the performative aspect of one group of mathematics coaches’ doing the math routine opened up conversations about mathematics, mathematics instruction, and mathematics coaching. Findings indicate that as the coaches engaged in doing the math together, opportunities to discuss mathematics and mathematics instruction were opened up, while conversations about mathematics coaching rarely surfaced. In interviews, participants discussed the benefits and drawbacks of participating in doing the math. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that secondary mathematics teachers may not be drawing significant benefit from the tertiary mathematics courses they take in preparation programs or in-service for professional development. While there are some theory-driven attempts to re-design or complement such courses for teachers, empirical evidence on how teaching might actually draw on these courses in practice is scarce. The M-Cubed project utilizes an innovative approach to generate empirical data for exploring this issue – a “lab” where mathematicians and experienced secondary mathematics teachers examine authentic mathematics lessons and discuss teaching alternatives – roads not taken – in specific situations. This article demonstrates this approach in an investigation of the affordances of Infinitesimal Calculus (IC) for secondary mathematics teaching. We draw on the theoretical framework of Commognition in conceptualizing affordances of IC for teaching, and show nuanced ways in which the content and practices of IC can support pedagogical practices and enrich the repertoire of secondary mathematics teachers in contingent situations, even when IC appears unrelated to the taught content. Our findings suggest that interactions of mathematicians and teachers may be a necessary ingredient for learning how IC could be brought to bear on secondary mathematics teaching. We conclude by discussing possible implications for IC courses for teachers.</p>

However, these factors are typically considered in isolation, negating the relationship between the two. This study examined the effect of two instructional practices, direct instruction and inquiry learning, on elementary students’ mathematics achievement, and how students’ self-efficacy beliefs mediate this relationship. The study further investigated whether such relationships are moderated by students’ Individual Education Plan (IEP) status. Data from standardized math tests administered to grade 6 students and questionnaires administered to students and teachers were analyzed in a multilevel factor score path analysis. Results demonstrated an indirect effect of instructional practice on math achievement through its influence on students’ self-efficacy. Specifically, inquiry learning was positively associated with students’ self-efficacy, whereas direct instruction was negatively associated with self-efficacy. Further, results showed a direct effect of inquiry learning on math achievement, but only for students with IEPs.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In mathematics classrooms, educators encourage both creativity and collaboration. In the current study we investigated the dialogical moves that made up the interactions of three groups of post high-school students who worked on an open-ended mathematics task. The aim of this study was to characterize collective strategic pathways that can lead to different creativity products, and the possible impact of leadership styles and dialogical moves on those pathways. Collective strategic flexibility was defined as the number of strategies used by the group. Three strategy paths were found, namely, a disjointed strategy path, an emerging strategy path, and a straightforward strategy path. Dialogical moves such as asking for help, receiving clarifications, and explicating strategies, led to fluency. Elaborating mathematical explanations led to originality. Strategic flexibility was supported by evaluating strategies. Group leadership styles also contributed to varying amounts of cooperation and collaboration, in turn furthering different aspects of creativity. Findings indicated that cooperative collectives can lead to original unpredictable solutions. When a group is more collaborative, collective strategic flexibility may increase. When there is a mix, and students collaborate in a way that ensures that all can contribute, then collective fluency is promoted.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study, the authors examined a group of related literatures that used the same large-scale nationally representative dataset with algebra achievement as the outcome to explore why results from the same dataset may differ across studies. More specially, the authors synthesized the extant research literature that utilized data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) to investigate the student-, teacher-, school-, and parent-level characteristics associated with algebra achievement and whether these relationships were consistent across students’ backgrounds (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and prior achievement). The authors have summarized the results of 21 studies across 2 outcome variables (ninth- and eleventh-grade algebra achievement) using optimal resource theory as a framework to summarize evidence-based practices for improving student outcomes.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This article presents the results of a knowledge synthesis and provides an unprecedented view of the research on algebraic thinking among children ages three to eight from both a theoretical and empirical perspective. First, we discuss the theoretical elements proposed in the research to study phenomena linked to the development of algebraic thinking and how it relates to other forms of thinking among young children. We then present findings on the ability of students to apply aspects of algebraic thinking in various contexts and offer theoretical interpretations from researchers. This article identifies key issues related to the essential themes for future studies.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Six 7th-grade students engaged with an instructional sequence involving the use of the TinkerPlots software to organize data sets in ways intended to help them construe two attributes: the location of quarters of the data within a sub-range of the entire set, and the spread of those portions. We present evidence of students’ thinking about these attributes drawn from their responses to questions posed in the instructional sequence. Comparison of findings from a pre-test and a culminating task suggest that the students enriched their ability to imagine and create hypothetical data from a given representative box plot, and that they became oriented to the spread of portions of a data set as indicated by the length of its quarters.</p>

                  <p>Six élèves de 7e année ont participé à une séquence pédagogique impliquant l’utilisation du logiciel TinkerPlotsMC dans le but d’organiser des ensembles de données de façon à ce que cela les aide à interpréter deux attributs: l’emplacement des données organisées en quartiles à l’intérieur d’un sous-intervalle de variation et la répartition de ces portions. À partir des réponses données aux questions posées dans la séquence pédagogique, nous montrons comment les élèves conçoivent ces attributs. Quand on compare les conclusions tirées d’un prétest avec celles d’une tâche intégratrice, on constate que les élèves ont amélioré leur aptitude pour imaginer et concevoir des données hypothétiques résultant d’un diagramme de quartiles représentatif donné; et qu’ils se sont orientés vers la répartition des portions d’ensembles de données en fonction de l’étendue des quartiles.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports from a case study which explores kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction in a teaching–learning activity about reflection symmetry. From a dialectical perspective, abstraction is here conceived as a process, as a genuine part of human activity, where the learner establishes “a point of view from which the concrete can be seen as meaningfully related” (van Oers &amp; Poland Mathematics Education Research Journal, 19(2), 10–22, 2007, p. 13–14). A cultural-historical semiotic perspective to embodiment is used to explore the characteristics of kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction. In the selected segment, two 5-year-old boys explore the concept of reflection symmetry using a doll pram. In the activity, the two boys first point to concrete features of the sensory manifold, then one of the boys’ awareness gradually moves to the imagined and finally to grasping a general and establishing a new point of view. The findings illustrate the essential role of gestures, bodily actions, and rhythm, in conjunction with spoken words, in the two boys’ gradual process of grasping a general. The study advances our knowledge about the nature of mathematical abstraction and challenges the traditional view on abstraction as a sort of decontextualised higher order thinking. This study argues that abstraction is not a matter of going from the concrete to the abstract, rather it is an emergent and context-bound process, as a genuine part of children’s concrete embodied activities.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>From the socio-critical perspective of mathematical modeling, reflexive discussions about the nature, criteria, and consequences of mathematical models are not a natural consequence of modeling in school. This report is part of a larger study focused on stimulating reflexive discussions in practice employing constructivist grounded theory as a research method. Twenty-seven college algebra students engaged in a 3-week modeling project at a community college in the USA. Audio-recorded group discussions and written reflections were collected to determine how reflexive discussions were taking place. Analysis of students’ actions and reflexive discussions during the modeling project produced four concepts: voicing mathematics, personalizing mathematics, challenging mathematics, and negotiating mathematics. These concepts are integrated into an overall process for stimulating reflexive discussions and are conceptualized as unboxing mathematics. The overarching concept of unboxing mathematics represents one interpretation of how reflexive discussions may be constituted during modeling activities and identifies classroom mathematical practices specific to the socio-critical modeling context of this study.</p>
