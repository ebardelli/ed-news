  Abstract
                  <p>This paper addresses implementation with respect to the professional development (PD) of teachers of mathematics and the educators/didacticians who work with them, through an inquiry-based developmental model. In contrast with a PD model in which educators show, guide or instruct teachers in classroom approaches and mathematical tasks, we present a developmental model in which teachers and educators collaborate to inquire into and develop their own teaching practice. The project, Learning Communities in Mathematics (LCM: e.g., Goodchild, Fuglestad and Jaworski, 2013) exemplifies this developmental model. Here we focus on a project Teaching Better Mathematics (TBM) which extends LCM and implements its developmental model at larger scale. We trace the implementation process through analysis of data gathered during and after the extended project, including written reflections of key didacticians, minutes from leadership meetings and two versions of the project proposal. Particularly, we trace learning and development through an activity theory analysis of the issues, tensions and contradictions experienced by participation in TBM.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>
      To increase possibilities for listening respectfully to Indigenous educators, there is a need to identify conversational prompts which are used to raise alternative views of social justice about mathematics education for Indigenous students. Using Nancy Fraser’s description of abnormal social justice, an analysis was made of transcripts from round table sessions, at an Indigenous mathematics education conference. This analysis identified a number of conversational prompts that enabled shifts from normal to abnormal discussions about social justice. Normal discussions exhibited assumptions in which mathematics was valued as a Western domain of knowledge; cultural examples could be used as vehicles to teach mathematics; and decisions about education for Indigenous students should be made by external authorities. In abnormal discussions, these assumptions were queried and alternative possibilities arose. The conversational prompts, which initiated this querying, occurred in a number of ways, including the telling of stories and the asking of questions that either directly or indirectly challenged normal justice discourses about Indigenous students’ learning of mathematics. Identifying conversational prompts can assist non-Indigenous mathematics educators, who wish to be allies, to challenge their own and others’ assumptions about normal social justice issues related to mathematics education for Indigenous students.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mounting evidence of the effectiveness of active learning strategies has prompted many mathematics departments to start engaging in transformational change efforts. Change, however, especially change in instructional practice, is a challenging endeavor. Some departments are using coordination of multi-section courses as a vehicle to enact changes and have designated or hired course coordinators to oversee efforts to transform instruction via active learning. This study explores the role of coordinators as instructional change agents for active learning using data collected from five university mathematics departments, all of which are successfully sustaining such efforts. We use Shadle et al.’s drivers for change as a framework for examining data from five retrospective case studies of change. Specifically, we investigate how these speculative drivers connect to coordinators’ roles as change agents in each story. We argue that coordinators are positioned to leverage three key drivers for change: providing materials and tools, encouraging collaboration and communication, and encouraging (and providing) professional development. Coordinators must also understand the local contexts and culture in order to engage in effective processes for supporting departmental change. To conclude, we discuss implications of this research for departments seeking to transform instruction.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Curriculum materials have a substantial influence on mathematics instruction and, consequently, students’ learning opportunities. Many curriculum programs provide instructional notes for teachers and tasks for students as a means of accommodating particular student groups, such as those identified for English language learners. The presence of such materials communicates a narrative about the students they seek to accommodate. In particular, this narrative entails what English language learners need to learn mathematics. We examined the curriculum materials in four commercially available curriculum programs to understand the learning opportunities they provide for the target group and their assumed needs inferred from analyzing those opportunities. We found the curriculum materials implied a homogenous view of English language learners as a group who requires mathematical remediation and additional vocabulary practice. The curriculum materials provided a narrow set of learning opportunities, in terms of both mathematics and language, and may reinforce teachers’ existing deficit perspectives.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics Learning Support Centres are becoming more and more common in higher education both internationally and in Germany. Whereas it is clear that their quality largely depends on a functioning interaction in consultations, little is known about how such consultations proceed in detail. On the basis of models from the literature and recorded support sessions (N = 36), we constructed a process model that divides consultations into four ideal–typical phases. In the individual consultations, forward or backward leaps occur, but overall the model seems to describe the data well. A high intercoder reliability shows that it can be applied consistently on real data by different researchers. An analysis of the consultations between students and tutors shows that both mainly work on past attempts or thoughts of the students to solve the exercise or problems and on concrete strategies to solve a problem within the session. In contrast, very little time is dedicated to summarizing and reflecting the solution. The data allows for a more in-depth discussion of what constitutes quality in advising processes and how it might be further explored. Practically, the model may structure support sessions and help in focussing on different goals in different phases.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>A quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an equity intervention on teacher candidates’ abilities to articulate equity-based beliefs, and demonstrate and apply equity-based skills and knowledge. Three pre/post instruments were utilized. Treatment participants (N = 35) were exposed to curricular modifications made to the traditional curriculum, including a workshop, panel event, online learning modules, and reflective postconferences. Quantitative findings showed a statistically significant treatment effect for treatment participants compared with candidates in the control group (N = 83). Qualitative analyses showed that treatment participants articulated more equity-based language when describing their beliefs and intentions for their future classroom communities. Implications for practice and research are provided.

It seeks to both make the case for studying the spatial history of within-district education boundaries and put the results of our historical mapping project into the public domain. Ultimately, we hope that researchers will use our data to explore their own questions about the history of New York City, its neighborhoods, and its schools, and that some may embark on similar boundary-mapping projects for other cities, counties, and school systems.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>The Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) is a widely administered measure of classroom quality that assesses teacher-child interactions in the domains of Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. We use data from an evaluation of state-funded prekindergarten provided to 684 children from families with low incomes (Mage = 57.56 months, 48% female) to examine the extent to which CLASS scores vary over the course of an observational period within a single day and investigate whether this variability is related to children’s school readiness at the end of the preschool year, holding constant two additional measures of quality. Teacher-child interactions in all three domains were moderately stable. Mean Classroom Organization was positively related to math, and variability in Classroom Organization was negatively related to literacy. Mean Instructional Support was negatively associated with language. Findings have implications for programs that utilize the CLASS to make high-stakes decision and inform professional development.

  Abstract
                  <p>We examine teachers’ reflections on incorporating digital instructional resources (DIRs) into their mathematics teaching. We analyze qualitative interviews with 39 elementary school teachers from four educational contexts: Belgium, Finland, Sweden, and the U.S., using a framework proposed by Pepin et al. (Int J Math Educ 46: 645-661, 2017) to consider opportunities for DIRs to shift elements of teaching and learning in potentially transformative ways. Teachers described three major domains of teaching practice where they used DIRs: (a) class instruction, (b) student practice, and (c) professional participation. We found that teachers readily used DIRs during class instruction and to support student practice, guided by their existing instructional goals, which were shaped in part by education structures in the context. Few teachers incorporated DIRs in ways that transformed typical learning spaces. We also found that DIRs impacted several aspects of teachers’ professional practices, including professional learning and collaboration. In particular, participation in social media and resource sharing altered the nature of and ways teachers participated in their own professional learning. We assert that efforts to use DIRs to stimulate change need to begin with an understanding of teachers’ current practices and use our findings to identify three potential levers that might support movement toward change.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>College students, and adults in general, may find it hard to identify trustworthy information amid the proliferation of false news and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. In Fall 2020, college students (N = 221) in an online general education civics course were taught through asynchronous assignments how to use lateral reading strategies to fact-check online information. Students improved from pretest to posttest in the use of lateral reading to fact-check information; lateral reading was predicted by the number of assignments completed and students’ reading comprehension test scores. Students reported greater use, endorsement, and knowledge of Wikipedia at posttest, aligning with the curriculum’s emphasis on using Wikipedia to investigate information sources. Students also reported increased confidence in their ability to fact-check COVID-19 news. While confidence was related to perceived helpfulness of the assignments, it was only weakly associated with lateral reading. Findings support the effectiveness of the online curriculum for improving fact-checking.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We exploit information about parental preference and a randomized component in the assignment of students to schools within a deferred acceptance (DA) mechanism to estimate the causal effect of enrolling in a charter school in Newark, New Jersey, on student test scores. The estimates incorporate variation from students attending about 70% of the city’s charter schools, accounting for about 85% of charter school enrollment. Enrolling in a Newark charter school that participated in the DA assignment process leads to a large and statistically significant increase in math and English Language Arts (ELA) scores. Enrolling in a charter school that is operated by either the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) or Uncommon charter school networks has an especially large effect.

It presents longer-term effects of CUNY ASAP in New York, showing that the program’s effect on associate’s degree receipt persisted through 8 years and likely represents a permanent increase in degree receipt. It also presents an analysis from the pooled study samples in New York and Ohio. The findings indicate that the program had consistent effects on degree receipt across the two states but also for somewhat different levels of service contrast, such as the number of additional advising visits.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>While there has been an increase in action research explicitly defined as feminist in orientation, there has not been sufficient discussion on the actual translation of feminist theory into research practices. The aim of this article is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge labelled Feminist Participatory Action Research (FPAR) by articulating specific research practices for conducting research with young women who are negotiating social injustice and marginalization. We define and describe four research practices: 1. coalescing into a group; 2. encouraging the shared ownership of the research process and its outcomes; 3. developing multiple centres of power; and 4. promoting interdependency. We illustrate these principles with specific examples from an FPAR study that explored how social workers in Israel can best support girls and young women in situations of distress. We explored this question with a group of young women who were active partners in the research process. We conclude the article by underscoring the linkage between these four practices and feminist theory.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Early evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced public school enrollment in many states. However, little is known about the underlying patterns of these declines. Using new district-level data from Massachusetts, we find that these declines were concentrated in traditional districts while charter, virtual, and vocational districts increased their enrollment. Though the enrollment declines in traditional districts were widespread, we also find that the percent declines were significantly larger in smaller districts and those serving higher concentrations of White and economically disadvantaged students. The implications for understanding the pandemic’s effects on learning opportunities and the anticipated fiscal stress on public schools are discussed.
