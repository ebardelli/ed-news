          Abstract
                  <p>The transition from school to university mathematics is a challenging process for many students. This phenomenon is reflected by high dropout rates from mathematics programs especially during the first year at university that may be related to the development of students’ mathematical interest and self-concept. Taking a learning psychological perspective, it is a relevant question if all students have similar development patterns of these variables or if students who are at risk to drop out show an unfavorable development. Moreover, for didactical issues, it is of particular relevance which factors influence this development. Within a longitudinal study, 556 first-semester students stated their interest and self-concept at the beginning and the middle of the first semester; dropout was measured at the beginning of the second year. By using regression analyses, we found that the development of students’ interest and self-concept is related to dropout. It seems that interest in university mathematics and mathematical self-concept of students, who dropped out, decreased significantly in contrast to the characteristics of students who continued their studies. In an exploratory follow-up study, we identified factors which probably influenced the development of students’ self-concept by asking 18 students in a first-semester mathematics course “linear algebra” about learning situations in which they experienced the emergence or the decline of self-concept. Using qualitative content analysis, we found that most of these situations occurred when students worked on mathematical homework tasks or got criterial feedback on their solutions. Based on the presented results, we discuss implications for teaching and learning of undergraduate mathematics.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>The notion of belonging is an often-referenced but under-theorized concept in studies of school organization. The purpose of this study is to examine the politics of belonging in schools and accompanying implications for how schools are organized and led. This research employs an autophotographic methodology. Student participants took photographs across 2 years of data collection of spaces where they did and did not “fit in” and participated in interviews to explain their photographs. Students identified four themes in their photographs regarding their sense of membership at school: (a) the importance of spaces where belonging is noncontingent; (b) the distinction between calm spaces and surveilled spaces; (c) anxiety in public, “wild” spaces where no help was available; and (d) generally positive but mixed impressions of teachers. An increased understanding of organization leadership for belonging is linked to numerous other timely concerns in educational administration, including equity and inclusion.

        <a href='aera open'>Monday, 02. January 2023</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>This partnership-based study identified how many middle and high school students take care of parents, siblings, and grandparents at home, via student surveys across Rhode Island public schools (N = 48,508; 46% White non-Latinx; 21% Latinx; 47% girls). Further, we investigated how students’ caregiving for family related to their school engagement, belonging, and emotional well-being. A sizable proportion of students reported caring for family for part (29%) or most of the day (7%). Girls and Black, Asian, Latinx, Native, and multiracial youth were more likely to care for family, compared to boys and White non-Latinx youth. Caregiving students from all demographics were more likely to experience intense sadness compared to noncaregivers, revealing a need to support caregiving youth in schools. In addition, caregiving girls reported lower levels of school engagement and school belonging. However, caregiving for part of the day was related to greater belonging among Black and Native youth.

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>Much of the mathematics that children experience in school neglect the skills increasingly needed for citizenship, particularly the power of complex data to investigate and make sense of the world. We draw on the relatively new field of data science as a multi-disciplinary approach to investigate problems through analysis of massive, non-standard, incongruous and/or messy data. Our exploratory qualitative study had as its research question: What can children learn about citizenship when they engage with data science? The case study in this paper illustrated ways that children’s learning about citizenship were enriched through an age-appropriate data science investigation. The study analysed classroom video from a Year 4 classroom (aged 9–10) over six lessons that integrated curricula in digital technologies, health, and mathematics. In these lessons, the children generated and analysed non-standard data and debated social, well-being and privacy issues as they considered their activities in cyberspace. The video data were analysed using a framework based on critical citizenship education literature that examined dimensions of power, collective engagement, individual responsibility and action. Three key findings emerged. First, the case study highlighted skills in citizenship education developed through data science, positioning children as agents and advocates. Second, the study showed how a complex data investigation in citizenship education was achievable with primary children through meaningful curriculum integration. This is important given that problems that citizens address are typically interdisciplinary. Finally, the findings revealed a gap between data science skills and those developed in the mathematics curriculum, and recommend ways that the maths curriculum could be updated.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Monday, 02. January 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The primary purpose of this quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was to examine whether a blended learning approach was more effective than traditional face-to-face instruction in improving the mathematical achievement and attitudes of preservice elementary teachers. The secondary purpose was to determine what specific features of blended learning were deemed most helpful to prospective teachers’ learning of mathematics. Sixty-three prospective teachers participated in a foundational mathematics course in either a face-to-face (F2F) traditional or blended learning format. At pre- and post-test, participants completed a researcher-developed mathematics achievement test and the Dutton’s Attitude Scale (Dutton in ESJ 68:259–264, 1968) . Blended learning participants also completed a post-course researcher-developed questionnaire on their perceptions of blended learning. Results indicated that participants who were enrolled in the blended learning format had significantly better attitudes at post-test than teachers in the F2F format, but no condition differences were found for mathematical achievement. Participants in the blended learning condition valued the flexibility of course structure and control over instructional pace but expressed that time management and decreased physical presence of the instructor were challenges. These findings suggest important elements to consider when designing blended learning courses.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions at all levels closed their doors and began to operate remotely. In this paper, we analyze the educational experiences of preservice mathematics teachers (PMTs) enrolled in mathematics teacher education programs from three South American universities, as the pandemic was unfolding. An exploratory study was conducted, based on an inductive and thematic qualitative text analysis of narratives written by 24 PMTs. Based on the study, we report on the following aspects: (1) experiences of PMTs in the passage to remote education (RE) mode (considering characteristics of remote classes—interactions, the rhythm of the class, teaching work—time management, home–classroom fusion, and physical and psychological discomfort), and (2) opportunities and limitation experienced by PMTs in relation to the use of technologies. The results of the study suggest the need to rethink teacher education programs regarding the integration of technologies in mathematics classes, the opportunities offered by hybrid education, and teacher education for distance teaching.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Reviewing is a fitting term to introduce this book. I have been familiar with the work of Luis Radford for many years now, and this book is a welcome addition to an already impressive authorship. It gathers over ten, even twenty, years of development of the theory of objectification in various publication venues and revisits its concepts, while presenting them as a coherent whole. This is a book I will keep at hand and use for various reasons: it is full of ideas and examples, interesting references, and great wording. It is an excellent resource for those such as myself who work “in dialogue” with the theory, and for someone looking for a general yet precise and concrete understanding of the theory.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article contributes to a growing conversation of teachers’ advocacy for marginalized students. We follow a cohort of teachers’ advocacy from their English as a second language certification courses into their work in one linguistically diverse school district. Dialogic discourse analyses of 3 years of discussions show the types of advocacy in which the teachers engaged, and identify five foundational discourse moves teachers employed to develop ideas and manage the relational complexity of advocacy. Findings provide evidence of the important role of intertextuality: voices across time and texts facilitated the teachers’ advocacy efforts. We offer a revised definition of language teacher advocacy to emphasize its discursive nature, arguing that an examination of the dialogic processes of advocacy work can help better delineate how it develops iteratively, contextually, and not always successfully. We implicate teacher education as an important catalyst for the preparation of teachers’ advocacy for under-served and historically marginalized English-learning students.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In the context of increasingly complex challenges facing 21st century school systems, action research has incredible potential to help leaders address persistent problems and implement context-specific, sustainable solutions. Just as powerful, the action research process can be transformative for the individuals, groups, and organization involved. The authors, a doctoral candidate and associate professor, illustrate these concepts by sharing experiences leading an action research study that tackled the problem of high teacher turnover in a school-university partnership context. The article focuses primarily on the constructing phase of the action research cycle, in which the school-university partnership action research team becomes a learning community. The authors offer practical advice for building trusting relationships and share the story of how this team experienced individual and group transformation while designing innovative new teacher support through the action research process.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Recently scholars have advocated for using teachers’ practice as a site for teacher learning. The recent proliferation of online, digital spaces, including simulated classrooms, has paved the way for novel approaches within practice-based teacher education. Yet, limited research has investigated the extent to which and how the use of online, simulated teaching experiences promote teacher learning of core teaching practices. The purpose of this study was to examine whether and how integrating simulated teaching experiences into teacher education coursework impacts preservice teacher (PST) learning. Findings showed that the use of simulated teaching experiences within elementary teacher education methods courses resulted in evidence of statistically significant growth in PSTs’ ability to engage in one core teaching practice: facilitating argumentation-focused discussions.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Challenges in the measurement of racial disparities in school discipline are a significant barrier to identifying policy and programmatic reforms that are effective at closing gaps. This article reviews key measurement issues and presents a set of empirical analyses as an illustrative case study. Specifically, we reframe the interpretation of discipline data in light of initiatives designed to reduce racial discipline disparities. We also characterize common metrics and recognize several additional ones for use in discipline disproportionality outcome evaluations. Leveraging a statewide policy reform as an example, we report findings from a quasi-experimental evaluation, which demonstrated that the various metrics can point to differing conclusions. We conclude with proposed guiding principles for the selection and use of discipline disproportionality metrics in evaluations.

          Abstract
                  <p>Gestures play a role in perception, production, and comprehension of language and have been shown to differ cross-linguistically and cross-culturally in aspects of performance and form-meaning relationships. Furthermore, gestures can serve as analytical tools to access tacit embodied-imagistic mathematical meanings that add to verbal-linguistic dimensions of meaning. At the same time, language plays important roles in interaction and cognition, influencing bilinguals’ learning of mathematics. Still, there is only very little research attending to the use of gestures of multilinguals as means to better understand the relationships between their language use and their mathematical thinking. This paper builds on research on multilingualism and on gestures—related and unrelated to mathematics education—to motivate and develop a framework for understanding better mathematics thinking and learning of multilinguals through integrating gesture analysis as related to languages, culture, and the use of registers. The application of this framework will be illustrated through two case studies in which we analyse interview data of a bilingual student and a bilingual mathematics teacher—focusing on gestures and language use while talking about the mathematical concept of ‘power’—or exponents—in Farsi (Persian) and in English. From analyzing the gestures’ form-meaning relations and their functions as related to hybrid language practices, we hypothesize on the vernacular and mathematical context as activated in both speech and gesture and on how it relates to mathematical meaning. From this, we draw practical implications for multilingual mathematical learning contexts and discuss implications for research on multilinguals’ mathematical thinking and learning.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Prior research substantially overstates the cost of retention under test-based promotion policies to both taxpayers and students who delay labor market entry because it omits two important factors. First, there is a delay between the intervention and the taxpayer’s expenditure. Second, on average, the treatment leads to less than a full year of additional schooling. I provide formulas for calculating the cost of grade retention within a test-based promotion policy and illustrate using data from Florida. Retaining a third-grade student under Florida’s policy was about 45% less costly to taxpayers and about 37% less costly to retained students than would be suggested by prior authors.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>A major affordance of one-on-one mathematics coaching is its potential to provide individualized, contextualized support for mathematics teachers’ learning. Coaches can adjust their work to individual teachers by focusing on instructional improvement goals that take account of teachers’ current knowledge, practice, and classroom contexts. It is, however, essential that coaches and teachers work to attain productive instructional improvement goals that are both feasible for teachers to attain and likely to result in immediate improvements in students’ learning, if attained. In this article, we describe how coaches can identify productive goals for individual teachers and then, on that basis, negotiate goals successfully with teachers, thereby supporting teachers in seeing productive goals as worthwhile. By describing these two processes, we further clarify the forms of coaching-specific expertise central to effective one-on-one mathematics coaching.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Before the 2020–2021 school year, policymakers and parents confronted the uncertain trade-offs implied by the health, educational, and economic consequences of offering instruction remotely, in person, or through a hybrid of the two. Most public schools in the United States chose remote-only instruction, and enrollment fell dramatically (i.e., a loss 1.1 million K–12 students). We examine the impact of these choices on public-school enrollment using panel data that combine district-level information on enrollment and instructional mode. We find offering remote-only instead of in-person instruction reduced enrollment by 1.1 percentage points (i.e., 42% greater disenrollment). The disenrollment effects of remote instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, more modestly, elementary schools. We do not find evidence that hybrid instruction had an impact.

          Abstract
      
                  <p>With limited time for science, using science trade books for science and language instruction has become more common in elementary schools. Studies show that trade books often neglect scientific practices. Yet previous analyses have not differentiated by targeted grade level nor by book type. Do some grade levels and types of books highlight scientific practices more comprehensively than others? To answer this question, 110 science trade books published in 2010–2016 were analyzed using the eight science and engineering practices highlighted in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (National Research Council in A framework for K-12 science education: Practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas, The National Academies Press., Washington, DC, 2012). The sampled books were coded as demonstrating or not demonstrating each of the eight scientific practices with respect to the targeted grade band (K-2, K-5, or 3–5). Results indicate that books targeting K-2 and K-5 reading levels contained fewer practices compared to those targeting grades 3–5. Book type also mattered. Biographies and books describing specific work of scientists (Scientist in the Field books) captured many scientific practices. Science Facts and Science Story books contained fewer practices and dominated the younger grade bands (K-2 and K-5 targeted books), while the distribution of book types was more balanced in the 3–5 targeted books. Practices related to the traditional scientific method were more often common than practices representing social aspects of science (e.g., Argument from Evidence). Implications of findings are discussed.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study investigated novice mathematics teachers participating in an online teacher education course focused on covariational reasoning and understanding the behavior of functions. The analysis centered on documenting the emergence of participants’ sociomathematical norms for engaging in online asynchronous discussions. In this paper, we characterized participants’ initial mathematical discourse and documented two emergent sociomathematical norms, namely explaining why and emergent shape discourse. When participants explained why, they used specific quantities or symbolic representations of functions to justify why function graphs have particular visual features. When participants engaged in emergent shape discourse, they coordinated change between covarying quantities to justify why function graphs behave in certain ways. This study provides evidence that online settings can provide context for mathematics teachers engaging in legitimate collaborative mathematical activity and that activity can be enhanced by participation in discourse featuring specific sociomathematical norms. We discuss conjectures regarding the potential of reflective discussion activities paired with the Notice and Wonder Framework to support the emergence of generative sociomathematical norms. We also discuss potential relationships between characteristics of participants’ mathematical discourse and their membership with the core and periphery of a social network.</p>
