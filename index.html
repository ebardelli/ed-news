  Abstract
                    <p>This article reports on a second national survey of higher education institutions in the USA to answer the question “Who teaches mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers, and what are these instructors’ academic and teaching backgrounds?” and addresses valuable information not collected with the first survey conducted in 2010. We surveyed 1740 institutions and a faculty member from each of 413 institutions (23.7%) participated in the survey. The survey results demonstrate that the majority of these institutions are not meeting the recommendations of the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (2012) and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (2017) for prospective elementary teachers to take at least 12 semester-hour credits of mathematics content designed specifically for them. The data do indicate that there is movement toward more activity-based approaches for these courses as compared to the 2010 survey. Additionally, there is an increase in these courses having instructors with doctorates in mathematics education as well as an increase in instructors having grades 7–12 teaching experience. Most instructors for these courses do not have elementary teaching experience and have likely not had opportunities to think deeply about the important ideas in elementary mathematics. While most institutions still do not provide training and/or support for these instructors, formalized support and training appear to be increasing since the 2010 survey.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>To better understand the critical early years of teaching and teacher identity development, this study explored the mathematics teacher identity of two early career middle school mathematics teachers and the influence of their working communities on its development. Emel and Berk graduated from the same reform-oriented teacher education program and were working in fundamentally different working communities that could be characterized as reform-unsupportive (Emel) and reform-supportive (Berk). They were interviewed three times and were observed extensively in their working communities. Findings revealed two different teacher identities: Emel exhibited a mathematics teacher identity that was more reform-oriented than non-reform-oriented, and Berk exhibited a non-reform-oriented mathematics teacher identity. Their working communities had influenced their mathematics teacher identity in ways that were both theoretically expected (positive effects of supportive conditions and negative effects of unsupportive conditions) and surprising (positive effects of negative conditions and no effects of positive conditions). The findings are discussed in detail with implications for teacher education programs and supports for early career teachers.

  Abstract
                    <p>Pedagogical beliefs are a critical factor in terms of integrating technology into teaching, but very few technology acceptance models (TAMs) have considered them. Hence, this study aims to extend the TAM by incorporating pre-service teachers’ conception of teaching and learning. The revised model examined the influence of pre-service mathematics teachers’ constructivist and traditional pedagogical beliefs on their technology acceptance through perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, and behavioral intention to use. Survey data were collected from 714 pre-service mathematics teachers in Turkey and analyzed through path analysis. The results showed that pre-service mathematics teachers’ pedagogical beliefs were more constructivist-oriented than traditional-oriented, and constructivist beliefs had a significant influence on the components of the TAM. On the other hand, pre-service teachers’ traditional-oriented beliefs did not influence their perceived usefulness of and attitudes toward technology but had positive effects on perceived ease of use. Implications for pre-service mathematics teacher education were discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Studies of facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers have been increasing in order to improve their preparation for conducting PD. However, specifications of what facilitators should learn often lack a conceptualization that captures facilitators’ expertise for different PD content. In this article, we provide a framework for facilitator expertise that is in line with current conceptualizations but makes explicit the content-related aspects of such expertise. The framework for content-related facilitator expertise combines cognitive and situated perspectives and allows unpacking different components at the PD level and the classroom level. Using two illustrative cases of different PD content (probability education in primary school and language-responsive mathematics teaching in secondary school), we exemplify how the framework can help to analyze facilitators’ practices in content-related ways in a descriptive mode. This analysis reveals valuable insights that support designers of facilitator preparation programs to specify what facilitators should learn in a prescriptive mode. We particularly emphasize the importance of working on content-related aspects, unpacking the PD content goals into the content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge elements on the classroom level and developing facilitators’ pedagogical content knowledge on the PD level (PCK-PD), which includes curricular knowledge, as well as knowledge about teachers’ typical thinking about a specific PD content. Situated learning opportunities in facilitator preparation programs can support facilitators to activate these knowledge elements for managing typical situational demands in PD.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Often, mathematics teachers do not incorporate whole-class discourse of students’ various ideas and solution methods into their teaching practice. Particularly complex is the in-the-moment decision-making that is necessary to build on students’ thinking and develop their collective construction of mathematics. This study explores the decision-making patterns of five experienced Dutch mathematics teachers during their novice attempts at orchestrating whole-class discourse concerning students’ various solution methods. Our goal has been to unpack the complexity of their in-the-moment decision-making during whole-class discourse through lesson observations and stimulated recall interviews. We investigated teacher decision-making adopting a model that combines two perspectives, namely (1) we explored student-teacher interaction with regard to building on student thinking and (2) we explored how the teachers based decisions during such interaction upon their own personal conceptions and interpretation of student thinking. During these novice attempts at orchestrating whole-class discourse, the teachers created many situations for students to articulate their thinking. We found that at certain instances, teachers’ in-the-moment decision-making resulted in opportunities to build on student thinking that were not completely seized. During such instances, the teachers’ decision-making was shaped by the teachers’ own conceptions of the relevant mathematics and by teacher conceptions that centered around student understanding and mathematical goals. Our findings suggest that teachers might be supported in their novice attempts at whole-class discourse by explicit discussion of the mathematics and of their conceptions with regard to student understanding and mathematical goals.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Many states and school districts in the United States use standardized test scores to compute annual measures of student achievement progress and then use school-level averages of these growth measures for various reporting and diagnostic purposes. These aggregate growth measures can vary consequentially from year to year for the same school, complicating their use and interpretation. We develop a method, based on the theory of empirical best linear prediction, to improve the accuracy and stability of aggregate growth measures by pooling information across grades, years, and tested subjects for individual schools. We demonstrate the performance of the method using both simulation and application to 6 years of annual growth measures from a large, urban school district. We provide code for implementing the method in the package schoolgrowth for the R environment.

  Abstract
                  <p>Educators sometimes effect changes in education through the implementation of new ideas, and sometimes extraordinary circumstances force them to change their educational approaches, as during the COVID-19 crisis. Although we live in a digital age, the limited use of technology in education, particularly prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and teachers’ insufficient experience with online or hybrid learning and teaching approaches resulted in several countries being unprepared for education during the pandemic. The flipped classroom (FC) is an innovative pedagogy with the potential to engage students in mathematics education using hybrid education combined with online and face-to-face learning, which is especially important during a pandemic. However, despite the high expectations surrounding this innovative approach, to date, no systematic literature review has discussed the opportunities and pitfalls of FCs in mathematics education regarding pandemic-related issues. In the present systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap and highlight the importance of flipping mathematics instruction during the pandemic and beyond. The results, which are based on textual analysis of 97 eligible articles, demonstrate that FC is a promising pedagogy that has numerous benefits for mathematics teaching and learning, although it is not a panacea for pandemic-related issues, as it also has several significant pitfalls. Overall, if the mechanism of mathematics education is to be crisis-ready, we should learn from experiences during the pandemic. In this regard, the current review contributes to research in mathematics education with the aim of gaining insight into successful implementations of FC pedagogy, not only during the pandemic but also beyond the crisis era of a pandemic.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Empirical growth benchmarks, as introduced by Hill, Bloom, Black, and Lipsey (2008), are a well-known way to contextualize effect sizes in education research. Past work on these benchmarks, both positive and negative, has largely avoided confronting the role of vertical scales, yet technical issues with vertical scales trouble the use of such benchmarks. This article introduces vertical scales and outlines their role in the creation of empirical benchmarks for growth. I then outline three strands of recent vertical scale research that call into question the grounds for relying on these benchmarks. I conclude with recommendations for researchers looking to contextualize observed effects of educational interventions without confounding their effects with vertical scaling artifacts.

  Abstract
                  <p>In activities based on proof without words (PWW), we developed, students are given a PWW– a diagram that alludes to the proof of a mathematical theorem. The students work collaboratively to construct a proof alluded by the PWW, and then each student writes and submits a proof attempt. In a 3-year design-based study, we investigate and develop PWW-based activities for advancing upper secondary students' proficiency in constructing proofs. We use the concept of gap-filling as a theoretical framework. In a nutshell, gap-filling is an action of adding information absent in a text that a reader does for sense-making. We inquire whether secondary school students independently construct a proof when a PWW is at their disposal, what characterizes those gaps that students identify and fill, and how PWW design principles influence students’ gap-filling. We identified four categories of gaps: key idea, generality, constructional, and figure property justifications. We find that students mainly fill key idea gaps but not generality gaps and that PWWs that presented the construction procedure led more students to fill the constructional gaps. However, PWWs that did not explicitly present some figures’ property led more students to fill those justification gaps. We identify five PWW design principles that can enhance secondary students’ gap-filling and conclude that a meticulous design paves the way to implement PWW-based activities for fostering mathematical proving.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>This article presents a case study on a secondary mathematics teacher, Mary (pseudonym), and her design of a set of instructional tasks in the context of proportional reasoning. In keeping with the way Singapore teachers generally conceive of instructional planning, we investigated the connections between four comparison tasks she designed through her instructional goals. We adopt the use of an item-level lens to analyse the instructional goals of individual tasks, followed by a set-level lens to determine the movement in her instructional goals across tasks. The metaphors of overlaps and shifts describe how the movement of her instructional goals helped to advance students’ understanding of proportionality and to develop their proportional reasoning. Findings illustrate the usefulness of adopting the metaphors of overlaps and shifts and using two lenses to gain insights on teachers’ complex design processes. Additionally, they suggest that teachers’ understanding of student’s knowledge at the primary level is valuable for designing tasks that will ease students’ transition to secondary mathematics.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we consider mathematical competitions for pre-university students, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and many national and regional Olympiads following a similar model. The problems proposed in these contests must be solvable by ‘elementary’ methods (i.e., without using calculus) and belong traditionally to four areas, namely, algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. Usually there is no explicit curriculum prescribing what parts of these subjects may be involved in the problems, however there is a hidden curriculum (HC) that may be deduced from the problems proposed and from what is considered a complete solution. In this paper, we try to characterize this HC showing typical problems, subjects, solutions, and strategies for each of the main areas. We also make a comparison of the HC with the traditional secondary school curriculum (SSC), with the following two goals: (1) to identify the main points that should be addressed in the preparation of students aspiring to participate in mathematical competitions, and (2) to suggest possible changes to it and diminish the gap between school and contemporary mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Research using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic suggests different models of how student learning may evolve in the progression of undergraduate mathematics coursework: from elementary courses in Calculus to more advanced courses in Analysis. An ideal model suggests that the theory-driven learning in the latter serves as a natural complement and extension to the primarily procedural focus of the former. A contrasting model points to a potential didactic obstacle to the ideal evolution of students’ knowledge: When the types of tasks in Analysis courses (e.g., “prove a specified limit”) resemble those in Calculus courses (e.g., “find a specified limit”). To gain insight into the actual evolution experienced by students, we contributed an exploratory study of one introductory Analysis course, including an analysis of assessment activities provided in the course and task-based interviews with 15 students shortly after they passed the course. Results suggest that when faced with “Analysis tasks” that look like “Calculus tasks,” most students do not mobilize the proof-based knowledge that was expected to be learned in Analysis. Moreover, this could be linked not only to the non-empty intersection of students’ Calculus and Analysis courses, but also to the place of Calculus and Analysis in the intersection of their differing future professional institutions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims to explore the challenges that pre-service early childhood teachers (PECTs) face in the processes of planning and implementing STEM education–based activities and their solutions about these challenges. A total of 39 third-year pre-service teachers in İstanbul, Turkey, participated in the study, which lasted 14 weeks. The data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire and focus group interviews. The data were analyzed via qualitative approaches and codes and themes were determined. As a result of the analysis, five themes related to the planning of STEM education–based activities emerged: identifying the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, children’s development level, material selection, and STEM integration. Regarding the challenges the PECTs faced during the implementation process of STEM education–based activities, six themes emerged: expressing the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, targeted instruction and implementations, children’s development level, time management, and classroom management. The analysis revealed 8 themes regarding the pre-service teachers’ solutions about successful planning and implementation of STEM education–based activities: materials to be used, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, classroom arrangement and management, time management, appropriateness to children’s level, identifying and expressing the problem, activity planning and implementation, and implementing STEM education. This study is important because it will contribute to the implementation of STEM-based activities more in early childhood classes, as it identifies the challenges faced in the process of designing and implementing STEM-based activities as well as providing suggestions for the solution of these problems.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This meta-analysis examines the effects of sorting secondary students into different tracks (“between-school” tracking) or classrooms (“within-school” tracking) on the efficiency and inequality levels of an educational system. Efficiency is related to the overall learning achievement of students, whereas inequality can refer to “inequality of achievement” (i.e., the dispersion of outcomes) or “inequality of opportunity” (i.e., the strength of the influence of family background on student achievement). The selected publications are 53 analyses performed in the period from 2000 to 2021, yielding 213 estimates on efficiency and 230 estimates on inequality. The results show that the mean effect size (Hedge’s G) of tracking on efficiency is not statistically significant (G = −.063), whereas it is significantly positive (G = .117) on inequality. We further set out to explain variation in effect sizes by (a) policy characteristics, (b) the operationalization of main variables, (c) the research design, (d) the set of control variables included in the statistical analyses, and (e) the quality of the study, year of publication, and publication status (peer reviewed or not peer reviewed).

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical modelling is endorsed as both a means and an end to learning mathematics. Despite its utility and inclusion as a curricular objective, one of many questions remaining about learners’ modelling regards how modelers choose relevant situational attributes and express mathematical relationships in terms of them. Research on quantitative reasoning has informed the field on how individuals quantify attributes and conceive of covariational relationships among them. However, this research has not often attended to modelers’ mathematization in open modelling tasks, an endeavor that invites further attention to theoretical and methodological details. To this end, we offer a synthesis of existing theories to present a cognitive account of mathematical model construction through a quantity-oriented lens. Second, we use empirical data to illustrate why it is productive for theories of modelling to attend to and account for students’ quantitative reasoning while modelling. Finally, we identify remaining challenges to coordinating different theoretical accounts of model construction.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Learning progressions have become increasingly prevalent in mathematics education as they offer a fine-grain map of possible learning pathways a child may take within a particular domain. However, there is an opportunity to build upon this research in ways that consider learning from multiple perspectives. Many current forms of learning progressions describe learning pathways without explicit consideration of how related skills and contexts directly or indirectly enhance or influence learning. That is, the structured and unstructured learning contexts that can help children develop conceptual understanding in a range of STEM contexts. We consider learning progressions from multiple perspectives, which will be particularly important for supporting learning in early years, play-based contexts. We propose a novel theoretical perspective, termed Bounded Learning Progressions (BLP), which demonstrates the connection and influence ways of reasoning have on the progression of learning in specific domains, bounded by the context in which learning develops. We suggest that this approach provides a broader perspective of children’s learning capabilities and the possible connections between such abilities, acknowledging the critical role context plays in the development of learning.</p>

To this end we make use of vignettes, data-grounded accounts of the situation at the three levels in the three countries. These are analysed using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD). While university praxeologies are relatively similar across the three countries, greater differences manifest themselves in high school and teacher education. For instance, at the high school level, in France a local praxeology on the limits of sequences is taught, which is not the case in England or Sweden. Results from the analysis of limits are extrapolated to comment on implications for the teaching of calculus, and for teacher education, in the three countries. The paper also raises methodological issues in our approach.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Of the many disciplines that rely on calculus, physics is among those with the strongest connections to this branch of mathematics. For instance, the derivative—one of the key notions of calculus—is used to describe velocity and acceleration, which play a central role in mechanics. In post-secondary education, in particular at the college level, it is not unusual for students to enroll in calculus and mechanics courses in the same year, and even the same term. In mathematics education, however, there is scant research focusing on students’ construction of the notion of derivative in a mechanics context, and existing studies offer contradictory views on the effectiveness of using mechanics to teach derivatives. To shed light on the use of derivatives in mechanics and calculus courses, our study focuses on practices involving the use of derivatives to study motion in both courses. We first conducted a praxeological analysis of five differential calculus textbooks and five mechanics textbooks to pinpoint their use of derivatives in the study of motion. This analysis was complemented by interviews with four mathematics teachers and three mechanics teachers, to compare their praxeologies with those of the textbooks. We then identified consistencies and inconsistencies between practices employed in both courses, which may have an impact on students’ learning, and formulated recommendations for teaching the notion of derivative in kinematics.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Although current and former English Learner (EL) or “ever-EL” students comprise one of the fastest-growing K-12 populations, we still know relatively little about the factors that influence their college-going. Using Perna’s seminal college-going model as a launching point, we propose a policy-driven empirical approach to explore how state and federal policy uniquely inform ever-EL students’ academic trajectories. This model considers how EL education policy is largely defined at the federal level but interpreted and implemented by state and local actors (i.e., the Lau and Castañeda cases). In addition, largely of immigrant origin, ever-EL students are directly affected by federal immigration policy as well as state immigrant policies. We suggest that the unique status of EL education in K-12 schools and the framing of immigrant-origin communities in federal and state policies make it necessary to consider both federal and state policy contexts in ever-EL college-going research.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Educational policy research on teacher unionization in the United States has been dominated by two theoretical perspectives: rent-seeking and teacher voice. While bringing valuable insights to bear, these views have mutated into rigid and often ideologically charged alternatives with strong normative claims about teacher collective bargaining. Drawing from a political economy framework, this article advances a distinct theoretical perspective focusing on the progressive coalition building activities of teachers’ unions (i.e., organizing and mobilizing to promote the interests of working people in policymaking). This perspective resolves previous theoretical anomalies of union behavior; provides many new avenues for research; and highlights distinct considerations for the practice of teacher organizing.
