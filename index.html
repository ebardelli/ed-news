  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For teachers of immigrant-origin students and their peers, emerging research notes the challenge of facilitating a high-quality education for students subject to traumatic events related to harsh immigration enforcement policies. This study examines whether new teachers from seven teacher preparation programs experienced the impacts of immigration enforcement and felt prepared to support students who were impacted. I surveyed new teachers in preservice and after 1 year of teaching (N = 473) using survey instruments developed by Cohen and colleagues along with additional constructs developed via pilot testing. New teachers reported that immigration enforcement negatively impacted their students and their job satisfaction. Teachers exposed to discussion of immigration policy and teachers who reported engaging with immigrant families in preservice were more likely to view themselves as prepared to support students. I discuss differences for teachers in urban, Title I, and elementary settings.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We examine access to effective teachers for low-income students in 26 geographically dispersed school districts over a 5-year period. We measure teacher effectiveness using a value-added model that accounts for measurement error in prior test scores and peer effects. Differences between the average value added of teachers of high- and low-income students are 0.005 standard deviations in English/language arts and 0.004 standard deviations in math. Differences between teachers of Black, Hispanic, and White students are also small. Rearranging teachers to obtain perfect equity would do little to narrow the sizable student achievement gap between low- and high-income students. We also show that a higher proportion of novice teachers in high-poverty schools contributes negligibly to differences in access to effective teachers.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Classroom observation research plays an important role in policy, practice, and scholarship for students with disabilities. When interpreting results of observation studies, it is important to consider the validity evidence provided by researchers and how that speaks to the intended use of those results. In this literature synthesis, we used Kane’s argument-based approach to validity to describe evidence of validity for uses of observation instruments in classroom observation research regarding teachers of students with disabilities. We identified 102 studies from 1975 to 2020 that met inclusion criteria. Results indicated many studies did not report validity evidence to support their use of the observation instruments. Over time, reporting levels for much of the evidence has remained relatively constant, but we noted a consistent decrease in number of observations conducted per teacher and a consistent and large increase in reporting of teacher participant characteristics. We provide implications of this for research and practice and suggestions for improving classroom observation research.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Nationally, educators suspend Black students at greater rates than any other group. This disproportionality is fueled by stereotypes casting Black students as “troublemakers”—a label students too often internalize as part of their identities. Across two independent double-blind randomized field trials involving over 2,000 seventh graders in 11 middle schools, we tested the efficacy of a brief intervention to buffer students from stereotypes and mitigate the racial suspension gap. The self-affirmation intervention helps students access positive aspects of their identities less associated with troublemaking in school. Confirmed in both trials, treatment effects cut Black-White suspension and office disciplinary referral gaps during seventh and eighth grade by approximately two thirds, with even greater impacts for Black students with prior infractions.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>As parents are increasingly given flexibility to enroll their children in a school of their choice, understanding parents’ preferences for school qualities is essential. Using a randomized survey experiment, this study adds to the existing literature by assessing parents’ preferences in a controlled environment, where they can be isolated from information asymmetries and constraints. Results suggest that achievement matters to parents but status matters more when evaluating quality and growth matters more when choosing between schools. Additionally, student demographics affect both parents’ perception of school quality and their likelihood of selecting into a school. This article has important implications for the theory and practice of accountability as it offers new insights on parents’ latent preferences for school qualities.

  Abstract
                  <p>The literature highlights differing views on the efficacy of modelling lessons for teacher professional learning. In this study we draw on dissonance theory to discuss lesson modelling that seeks to transcend ‘do as I do’ imitation and provoke teachers’ attention to intended teaching practices: a necessary pre-cursor for changes to practice. A collective case study investigated the experiences and perceptions of 18 practising primary teachers from four school contexts participating in the process of: collectively observing modelling of mathematics lessons in their classrooms, analysing different parts of those practices with the modeller, and enacting them. It was found that modelling lessons associated with inquiry-oriented approaches for developing students’ problem-solving and reasoning in teachers’ own classrooms appeared to confront their assumptions about traditional approaches to teaching and learning mathematics. The teachers’ surprise at their students’ engagement in the challenging learning experiences conflicted with their existing views of teaching and impelled them to reflect on and set goals for improving their practice. Suggestions for pre- and post-lesson protocols for stimulating productive discussions are proposed, along with implications for designing school-based professional learning processes using lesson modelling.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Although personal identities influence teaching and learning and the field of mathematics education is committed to equity and diversity for all learners, sexual minorities have been neglected in mathematics education research. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to call for research on sexual identity in mathematics education. I first define key terms and their relationships. Next, I discuss how students’ sexual identity relates to school experiences and outcomes. I then summarize existing research on sexual identity and STEM/mathematics education. Finally, I recommend research on sexual identity and mathematics education that can advance our field in a continued commitment to equitable mathematics teaching and learning.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues are urgent in education. We developed and evaluated a massive open online course (N = 963) with embedded equity simulations that attempted to equip educators with equity teaching practices. Applying a structural topic model (STM)—a type of natural language processing (NLP)—we examined how participants with different equity attitudes responded in simulations. Over a sequence of four simulations, the simulation behavior of participants with less equitable beliefs converged to be more similar with the simulated behavior of participants with more equitable beliefs (ES [effect size] = 1.08 SD). This finding was corroborated by overall changes in equity mindsets (ES = 0.88 SD) and changed in self-reported equity-promoting practices (ES = 0.32 SD). Digital simulations when combined with NLP offer a compelling approach to both teaching about DEI topics and formatively assessing learner behavior in large-scale learning environments.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This study examines disruptions to postsecondary education plans in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using nationally representative data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey from August 2020 through March 2021, we investigate the prevalence, forms, reasons, and disparities of education disruption across different sociodemographic groups. While nearly three in four households report education plan disruption, the forms and reasons are drastically different. Black and Latinx respondents are more likely to report plan cancellation, while Whites are more likely to report taking classes in different formats. Non-White groups are more likely to cancel plans due to health or financial concerns, while Whites are more likely to cancel plans due to concerns about changes to campus life. Results also reveal nuanced intersections of race, type of education plans, and household vulnerability in affecting education disruption, pointing to the necessity of well-targeted initiatives to address long-term consequences and resulting inequality.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we analyse a large, opportunistic dataset of responses (N = 219,826) to online, diagnostic multiple-choice mathematics questions, provided by 6–16-year-old UK school mathematics students (N = 7302). For each response, students were invited to indicate on a 5-point Likert-type scale how confident they were that their response was correct. Using demographic data available from the online platform, we examine the relationships between confidence and facility (the proportion of questions correct), as well as gender, age and socioeconomic disadvantage. We found a positive correlation between student confidence and mean facility, higher confidence for boys than for girls and lower confidence for students classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged, even after accounting for facility. We found that confidence was lower for older students, and this was particularly marked across the primary to secondary school transition. An important feature of the online platform used is that, when students answer a question incorrectly, they are presented with an analogous question about 3 weeks later. We exploited this feature to obtain the first evidence in an authentic school mathematics context for the hypercorrection effect (Butterfield &amp; Metcalfe J EXP PSYCHOL 27:1491–1494, 2001), which is the observation that errors made with higher confidence are more likely to be corrected. These findings have implications for classroom practices that have the potential to support more effective and efficient learning of mathematics.</p>

Several actions reimagine the work of mathematics as building blocks for engaging the flourishing for Black communities: (1) expanding and amplifying direct networks for Black parents to share, communicate, and advocate for their own needs and spaces around mathematics; (2) making visible and amplifying our advocacy for racial justice in the content creation and representation found in current digital platforms for meeting the needs of Black communities; and the need to (3) invest in, prioritize usage of, and illuminate mathematics commercial and academic entities focused solely on creating content and centering Black (and other people’s) knowledge and experiences in mathematics for Black families.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Visual representations, such as diagrams, are known to be valuable tools in problem solving and proof construction. However, previous studies have shown that simply having access to a diagram is not sufficient to improve students’ performance on mathematical tasks. Rather, students must actively extract information about the problem scenario from their diagrams for them to be useful. Furthermore, several studies have described the behaviors of mathematicians and students when solving problems and writing proofs, but few have discussed students’ behaviors in the context of proof writing in introductory point-set topology. We present a case study of an undergraduate, Stacey, enrolled in a general topology course. Throughout a semester, we presented Stacey with several proof-related tasks and examined how and why Stacey used diagrams when working on these tasks. Based on our analysis, we concluded that Stacey’s diagram creation and subsequent use during the construction of a given proof was an effort to identify the key idea of the proof. We describe Stacey’s overall proving behaviors through the lens of a problem-solving framework and present Stacey’s use of diagrams as an aid to discovering the key ideas of proofs in topology.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate secondary mathematics teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking in the context of a professional development (PD) program utilizing modeling-based teacher investigations. The PD program was conducted with two groups of mathematics teachers from two public high schools. It included seven 1-month-long cycles, each consisting of an introductory meeting, the teachers’ classroom implementations of a model-eliciting activity (MEA), and a follow-up meeting focusing on the teachers’ collaborative investigation and discussion of students’ written work, including their strategies to solve the MEA. Findings suggested that participating in the PD program promoted the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking, albeit differently, over time. We elaborated on the components of the PD program that might have influenced the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking. Implications of the findings on teachers’ noticing for researchers, PD leaders, and teacher educators are discussed in terms of potential directions for future research and practice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper concerns the relationship between research and governance policy in three Swedish major development projects in mathematics education: the New Math project (1960–1975), the PUMP project (1970–1980), and the Boost for Mathematics project in (2012–2016). All three projects were driven or financed by the Swedish central school authorities. Using a historical comparative method, this study deepens the understanding of how research co-exists with governance policy when preparing innovations in mathematics education. The main historical sources are official reports and governmental decisions concerning the three projects. The analysis is focused on the nature of the innovations of each project and the role of researchers in the process of creating the innovations. The analysis highlights the theories and the methods involved in those processes. The three projects are also positioned in a context of school governance policy. In Sweden, the prevailing school governing policy changed from a highly centralised governance in the 1960s to a highly decentralised governance in the 2010s. The paper concludes by discussing to what degree the researchers adhered to principles of research or school governance; in particular, the Boost for Mathematics project is considered in this regard. The relevance of the paper in relation to the emerging field of implementation research in mathematics education concerns how historical studies can give new insights about contemporary development projects in mathematics education.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Implementing innovations in mathematics education relies on scaling up professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers. Within the German Center of Mathematics Teacher Education (DZLM), the complexities involved in scaling-up processes are addressed with three implementation strategies: a material, a personnel, and a systemic strategy. For each of them, the research base is empirically established by design research and intervention studies. The personnel strategy focuses on preparing teachers for innovative teaching approaches and on preparing PD facilitators for conducting PDs on the content involved. The empirical research required for creating a research base for the personnel strategy investigates what teachers and facilitators need to know about their learners (students on the classroom level, teachers on the PD level) with regard to a specific (PD) content. The main focus of the material strategy is to provide support for teachers and facilitators by adaptable curriculum materials for classrooms and PD sessions. The empirical research on the material strategies focuses on how such material needs to be constructed to ensure both flexibility and fidelity for impactful quality implementation. The systemic strategy involves considering the systemic contexts on each level and cooperating with the respective stakeholders (e.g., school principals or regional PD authorities). The corresponding empirical research focuses on the interplay of processes and systemic conditions. In this paper, we present the implementation strategies on different levels, and typical research approaches and results for strengthening their empirical and theoretical bases.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper builds on a range of traditions in educational research and design to argue, with empirical evidence, that constructing powerful instructional materials and approaches that work at scale requires a grounding in theory and a commitment to engineering practice, including rapid prototyping and multiple development cycles. Specifically, we claim that improving practice within a reasonable timescale requires replicable materials that integrate: (1) grounding in robust aspects of theory from prior research, (2) design tactics that combine these core ideas with a design team’s creativity, along with (3) flexibility in the draft materials that affords adaptation across contexts, (4) rapid prototyping, followed by iterative refinement cycles in increasingly realistic circumstances, with (5) feedback from each round of trials that is rich and detailed enough to inform revision, and (6) continued refinement on the basis of post-implementation feedback ‘from the field’. Examples of successful implementation are analysed and related to the various roles that research-based theory and programmatic research-based methods of development can and should play in the complex process of turning insights from research into improvements in practice. In contrast, we shall argue that materials which are written and published without the development processes (4) to (6)—still the great majority—lack research validity for use at scale.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Inquiry into the teaching and learning of mathematics is a central aspect of the work of both the mathematics teacher and the mathematics education researcher, yet there are profound differences between the practices and processes underlying educational inquiries within each community. These differences are known to hinder implementation of research, yet they can also become a valuable resource. This paper explores a particular model of implementation of research: mathematics teachers adopt and adapt practices and processes of disciplined educational inquiry in a co-learning partnership with mathematics education researchers. We present a narrative inquiry of a teacher–researcher community that designed and studied classroom activities aimed at encouraging students to ask meaningful mathematical questions. The data analysis, informed by the literature on boundary objects and boundary crossing, highlights how the teachers and researchers leveraged their different processes and practices of educational inquiry as a resource in their collaborative inquiry. We conclude by suggesting that informed and thoughtful attention to the differences between teacher inquiry and disciplined inquiry may support and enhance mathematics education research implementation.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>With this article, we aim to spur a conversation on research implementation in the context of collaborations of mathematics teachers and educational researchers, with a special interest in projects situated in university mathematics education. Implementation has been often discussed in relation to the education of school teachers, and we suggest that the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical apparatus that has been developed in this research area can be re-purposed to study implementation. Specifically, we propose that in collaborative projects, implementation can be construed as an interactive change-oriented process, in which teachers and researchers develop their praxeologies through interaction and joint work on boundary objects. We illustrate the usefulness of this proposal with a teacher-mathematician and a mathematics education researcher who joined forces to introduce scriptwriting activities into an undergraduate mathematics course. Drawing on the theoretical analysis and illustration, we make suggestions for future implementation studies in the context of teacher-researcher collaborations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper I explore the question of what counts as successful implementation of a mathematics professional development (PD) project at scale. Two kinds of upscale are presented and differentiated from one another: upscale of settings and upscale of values, and the link between this differentiation and how success may be defined is discussed. As part of the discussion, three models of taking a PD project to scale are described, namely replication, adaptation and reproduction, and these are tied to the degree of professional autonomy of teachers within the PD. The examination of these ideas draws on data from two PD projects for secondary mathematics teachers in Israel, that are now years after their pilot phase and still being implemented. The first project is aimed at supporting mathematics teachers in teaching mathematically at-risk students and in helping these students to succeed in high-stakes exams. The second project is aimed at enhancing mathematics teachers' reflection on their teaching practices, using classroom video as a tool. Both projects were implemented at scale across Israel, and reviewing results from these implementations enables some general insights to be gained regarding the success of scaled-up PD projects. The crucial role of PD facilitators in successful implementations is highlighted.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Implementation support strategies such as professional development (PD) are pivotal in guaranteeing the assistance that teachers need to enact mathematics teaching innovations and to secure lasting change. Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven’s (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177–211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator’s process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices. Recommendations for the education of PD facilitators in large-scale initiatives are provided.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Students’ negative affective performance in mathematics learning is a global problem, and the situation is especially challenging in high-achieving East Asian countries. Taiwan’s Just Do Math (JDM) program was launched to resolve this problem and to serve as an example of successful scaling up with regard to implementation of innovation. We developed a framework consisting of a synthesis of the literature on essentials for successful implementation and for scaling up, and applied this framework for the purpose of identification of the factors contributing to the success of the JDM program. The identified factors include the following: the development of low-complexity sources for teachers’ use and the low degree of adaptation required to sustain fidelity; the consideration of characteristics of adopters to promote innovation outside schools; construction of communication channels to ensure the dissemination of the core ideas of JDM; the feedback mechanism through which participating teachers can acknowledge the relative advantages of innovation as realized in the program; the consideration of the influence of historical, social, political, and economic factors on program implementation; and the efforts to ensure teachers’ in-depth learning, acknowledgment of the promoted principles, and the sustainability of implementation through implementation of JDM activities in regular mathematics classes.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to present the need for stakeholders to share an agreed-on Theory of Change (ToC) during the various phases of an implementation process. To this end, we draw on the Swedish Boost for Mathematics (BM), a large-scale national educational initiative, and its intrinsic ‘algebra’ instructional module. More precisely, we analyze a cohort of official evaluation reports on the BM from the perspective of a critical case study. The BM’s embedded algebra module and its associated material offer an instrumental example. This analysis relies on a selection of theoretical constructs related to Implementation Research (IR), such as (educational) innovation, value, stakeholders, degree of merit, policy dimension, theory-driven evaluation, and ToC. These theoretical constructs derive from both general IR and mathematics education research. We identify four phases of implementation, based on the analyses of the BM, namely, policy and organization, development, implementation, and evaluation. The analyses illustrate the need for alignment among these phases, associated with the endorsed, enacted, recognized and applied ToC of stakeholders. As a critical example, BM illustrates the many pitfalls of large-scale, scaled-up educational innovations—one of these being the potential failure of evaluations—owing to lack of an agreed-on ToC.</p>
