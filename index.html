  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We use a novel database of student teaching placements in Washington State to investigate teachers’ transitions from student teaching classrooms to first job classrooms and the implications for student achievement. We find first-year teachers are more effective when they teach in the same or an adjacent grade, in the same school type, or in a classroom with student demographics similar to their student teaching classroom. We document that only 27% of first-year teachers are teaching the same grade they student taught, and that first-year teachers tend to begin their careers in higher poverty classrooms than their student teaching placements. This suggests that better aligning student teacher placements with first-year teacher hiring could be a policy lever for improving early-career teacher effectiveness.

  Abstract
                  <p>Pedagogical beliefs are a critical factor in terms of integrating technology into teaching, but very few technology acceptance models (TAMs) have considered them. Hence, this study aims to extend the TAM by incorporating pre-service teachers’ conception of teaching and learning. The revised model examined the influence of pre-service mathematics teachers’ constructivist and traditional pedagogical beliefs on their technology acceptance through perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, and behavioral intention to use. Survey data were collected from 714 pre-service mathematics teachers in Turkey and analyzed through path analysis. The results showed that pre-service mathematics teachers’ pedagogical beliefs were more constructivist-oriented than traditional-oriented, and constructivist beliefs had a significant influence on the components of the TAM. On the other hand, pre-service teachers’ traditional-oriented beliefs did not influence their perceived usefulness of and attitudes toward technology but had positive effects on perceived ease of use. Implications for pre-service mathematics teacher education were discussed.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Educational research is repeatedly confronted with the question of its relevance. Current interpretations of relevance narrowly focus on outcomes and impact of research. In this essay, we propose an alternative, ontological conceptualization of relevance, arguing that more is at stake than outcomes and impact. We characterize the ontology of education and learning in terms of people’s meaningful movements in an always changing world and propose that relevance of educational research resides in what we call “ontological synchronization”—continuous attunement to what is happening and matters at hand, and what future is being generated, including what values and judgments researchers themselves perpetuate in society. Such synchronization, we conclude, hinges on a disciplinary and ethical commitment to principles of actuality and generativity. We discuss what such conceptualization of relevance implies for educational research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Many disciplines make use of mathematical concepts. However, there are often discrepancies between the way mathematical concepts are understood and taught in mathematics and the way they are used in other disciplines. The literature suggests that such discrepancies might make it hard for students in mathematics service courses to make a connection between the mathematical concepts taught and the way they are used in the students’ major disciplines. We investigated this hypothesis for one specific example in mathematics for economics students – the derivative and its interpretation commonly used in economics as the amount of change when increasing the production by one unit. We conducted an interview study investigating to what extent economics students can make a connection between the mathematical concept of the derivative and this common economic interpretation of the derivative. This study provides empirical evidence that it is actually difficult for economics students to make this connection, even though it was covered in their calculus course. In particular, the study reveals difficulties students have when trying to make this connection, which could be addressed in teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical word problem solving is influenced by various characteristics of the task and the person solving it. Yet, previous research has rarely related these characteristics to holistically answer which word problem requires which set of individual cognitive skills. In the present study, we conducted a secondary data analysis on a dataset of N = 1282 undergraduate students solving six mathematical word problems from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Previous results had indicated substantial variability in the contribution of individual cognitive skills to the correct solution of the different tasks. Here, we exploratively reanalyzed the data to investigate which task characteristics may account for this variability, considering verbal, arithmetic, spatial, and general reasoning skills simultaneously. Results indicate that verbal skills were the most consistent predictor of successful word problem solving in these tasks, arithmetic skills only predicted the correct solution of word problems containing calculations, spatial skills predicted solution rates in the presence of a visual representation, and general reasoning skills were more relevant in simpler problems that could be easily solved using heuristics. We discuss possible implications, emphasizing how word problems may differ with regard to the cognitive skills required to solve them correctly.</p>

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Support groups are one possibility to empower informal carers and accordingly have spread across many countries because of their informal, inexpensive nature and because of their effectiveness. This paper aims to reflect on the viewpoints and experiences of the lessons learned from the participatory action research (PAR) conducted from 2016 to 2019. During PAR, several support groups in different regions of Estonia were launched to empower the informal caregivers. In the study, the stakeholders and researchers participated as partners and developed new knowledge and 17 support groups were launched in different regions of Estonia.In conclusion, our experiences highlighted the stakeholders’ collaboration which resulted in creating the knowledge needed to launch support groups. Based on our experience, we recommend launching support groups in countries where they do not exist yet, and to apply participatory action research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Problem solving and problem posing have long been of interest to the mathematics education community. In this survey paper we first look at some of the seminal moments in the history of research on the important topics. We then use this history to position the state-of-the-art research being done in both problem solving and problem posing, before introducing the presented state-of-the-art developments in problem solving and problem posing. We then use this work as a backdrop against which to introduce the 16 empirical papers that make up this special issue. Together these 16 papers add nuance to what is already known about problem solving and problem posing; this nuance is the result of attending to very specific contexts and purposes in which these activities are embedded. We end the paper by discussing the future directions these fields can take.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics discussions are important for helping students to develop conceptual understanding and to learn disciplinary norms and practices. In recent years, there has been increased attention to teaching prospective teachers to lead discussions with students. This paper examines the possibilities of designing a formative assessment that gathers information about prospective elementary teachers’ skills with leading problem-based mathematics discussions and makes sense of such information. A decomposition of the practice of leading discussions was developed and used to design the assessment. Nine first-year teachers who graduated from a range of different teacher education programs participated in the study. The findings reveal that our formative assessment works to gather information about teachers’ capabilities with leading discussions and that the associated tools support making sense of the information gathered. This suggests that such tools could be useful to support the formative assessment of the developing capabilities of prospective teachers.</p>

  AbstractIt is well understood that postsecondary education increases lifetime earnings, yet the
     complexity of the college application process creates a barrier to postsecondary enrollment.
     This paper investigates a whole-school external application assistance program run by a
     nonprofit student support services organization, Career Compass of Louisiana. We use panel data
     of Louisiana high schools in a difference-in-differences framework and find that exposure to
     Career Compass increases postsecondary enrollment by 3.9 percentage points. Moreover, the
     effect of exposure is larger in school districts with a majority of black students as well as
     districts with a majority of low-income students. By providing services to all schools within a
     district, the program is able to achieve low costs relative to similar programs and effects
     that are in line with many more expensive programs, suggesting that scaling this model to new
     areas could provide a cost-effective approach to increasing postsecondary enrollment among high
     school graduates.

                    effort and only suggestive evidence of positive effects on teaching evaluations.
                    These results suggest that teaching repetition is a powerful tool to reduce
                    teachers’ preparation time without negative effects on students.

  AbstractRecent efforts to increase college access and completion concentrate on reducing

                    have expressed concern that such reductions may not lead to long-term gains in
                    college completion. In this paper, I use detailed data on students’
                    college enrollment and completion outcomes to study how community college
                    tuition rates affect students’ outcomes across both public and private
                    colleges. By exploiting spatial variation in tuition rates, I find that reducing
                    tuition at a student's local community college by $1,000 increases
                    enrollment at the college by 3.5 percentage points (18 percent) and reduces
                    enrollment at non-local community colleges, for-profit institutions, and other
                    private, vocationally focused colleges, by 1.9 percentage points (15 percent).
                    This shift in enrollment choices increases students’ persistence in
                    college, credit completion, and the probability that they transfer to and earn
                    bachelor's degrees from four-year colleges.

  AbstractOne explanation for negative or null findings in prior research on postsecondary
                    remediation is that college may be too late to address issues of academic
                    underpreparedness. This study evaluates the impact on student outcomes when
                    college math remediation is offered in the senior year of high school. The
                    Seamless Alignment and Integrated Learning Support (SAILS) program in Tennessee
                    targets students with low eleventh-grade ACT math scores. Students who pass
                    SAILS in twelfth grade can enroll directly in college-level math courses at any
                    Tennessee community college. Using a triple-difference design, we exploit
                    variation in students’ treatment status based on ACT math scores
                    (remediation-eligible versus remediation-ineligible), high school adoption of
                    SAILS (first cohort versus later cohort), and senior year (before versus during
                    first SAILS year). We find that SAILS-eligible students in the first cohort were
                    significantly less likely to enroll in remedial math courses in college, and
                    more likely to enroll in and pass college-level math overall. These students
                    also earn 2.8 additional credits by their second year. We detect no significant
                    differences in high school graduation rates, college enrollment, or
                    postsecondary credential attainment within two years. The program advanced
                    progress toward several, but not all, of the potential goals examined.

  AbstractTo evaluate the net effects of classroom disciplinary practices, policy makers
                    and educators must understand not only their effects on disciplined students but
                    also their effects on non-disciplined peers. In this study, we estimate the link
                    between peer suspensions and non-suspended students’ learning
                    trajectories in a California school district where middle and high school
                    students took up to twelve basic skills tests in mathematics and English
                    Language Arts (ELA) over the course of the 2009–10, 2010–11, and
                    2011–12 school years. We find that Hispanic students, students eligible
                    for free or reduced-price lunch, English language learners, students enrolled in
                    special education, and low-achieving students are disproportionately exposed to
                    classmate suspensions. Analyses with student and classroom fixed effects show
                    that student achievement in mathematics increases when their classmates receive
                    suspensions, particularly suspensions attributed to disruptive behavior. We find
                    no association between classmate suspension and ELA achievement. Because these
                    results come from schools in which suspensions are relatively rare events, they
                    may not generalize to settings with draconian disciplinary cultures.
                    Nonetheless, our findings imply that suspensions, when used appropriately, can
                    improve the academic achievement of non-suspended students, particularly for
                    students from vulnerable populations.

  AbstractIn a flipped classroom, an increasingly popular pedagogical model, students view
                    a video lecture at home and work on exercises with the instructor during class
                    time. Advocates of the flipped classroom claim the practice not only improves
                    student achievement but also ameliorates the achievement gap. We conduct a
                    randomized controlled trial at West Point and find the flipped classroom
                    produced short-term gains in math and no effect in economics. The flipped model
                    broadened the achievement gap: Effects are driven by white, male, and
                    higher-achieving students. We find no long-term average effects on student
                    learning but the widened achievement gap persists. Our findings demonstrate
                    feasibility for the flipped classroom to induce short-term gains in student
                    learning; however, the exacerbation of the achievement gap, the effect fade-out,
                    and the null effects in economics, suggest that educators should exercise
                    caution when considering the model.

  AbstractThis paper examines whether schoolwide free meals affect disciplinary outcomes,
                    focusing on the use of suspensions. Under the Community Eligibility Provision
                    (CEP), schools serving sufficiently high-poverty populations may enroll their
                    entire student bodies in free lunch and breakfast programs, extending free meals

  AbstractThis paper examines whether schoolwide free meals affect disciplinary outcomes,
                    focusing on the use of suspensions. Under the Community Eligibility Provision
                    (CEP), schools serving sufficiently high-poverty populations may enroll their
                    entire student bodies in free lunch and breakfast programs, extending free meals
                    to some students who would not qualify individually, and potentially decreasing
                    the stigma associated with school meals. We leverage the staggered rollout of
                    CEP across states and school discipline measures for the near-universe of public
                    schools to assess how disciplinary infractions change within a school as it
                    becomes eligible for CEP. We conclude that schoolwide free meals reduced
                    suspensions statistically significantly by approximately 17 percent for white
                    male elementary students. Point estimates for other subgroups in elementary
                    schools, and overall, are negative but smaller in magnitude; while treatment
                    effects for black students are statistically insignificant, we also cannot rule
                    out equal treatment effects between black and white students. We lack
                    statistical power to rule large positive or negative effects for middle and high
                    school students. The reductions among white students are somewhat larger in
                    areas with high baseline poverty rates, consistent with universal meals programs
                    serving an unmet need.
