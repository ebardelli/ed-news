          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This article provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of DPMs. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>To assess the elements necessary to be a successful learning community (ClinCalc) mentor to medical students from the mentee’s perspective. Few such studies have utilized the in-depth and richness of detail obtained in qualitative studies. This qualitative study analyzed four focus group discussions lasting 45–90 min conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, which has an established LC, in the year 2018. The groups included 14 pre-clerkship and 8 clerkship students. Investigators evaluated transcriptions of the focus group discussions using ATLAS.ti software. Three overarching categories of discussion emerged from the group discussions: (1) Relationship Competence, (2) Teaching Competence, and (3) Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence. Relationship Competence themes included “walk with me,” relationship is most important, and one-on-one. Teaching Competence themes included above and beyond, recognize and address mentor limitations, and safe and enriching environment. Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence themes included ethical decision making and compassionate care for diverse patient populations. Mentees focused on various aspects of the mentor-mentee relationship as the single most essential competence. Themes mentees discussed as important qualities of a successful mentor may denote qualities to be prioritized in faculty development and mentor recruitment. Future studies could investigate how the LC environment informs former medical students and promotes patient outcomes.

          Abstract
                  <p>We attend to the composition of even and odd functions, as featured in imagined dialogues between a teacher and students, composed by sixteen teachers in a professional development program. Data were analyzed as aimed at addressing students’ intellectual needs, with particular attention to the need for causality and the need for certainty. The results indicate that participants bring into account a myriad of approaches that either complement or replace algebraic definitions of even and odd functions. We provide possible explanations for such a phenomenon in the discussion of the findings.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Professors in proof-based mathematics courses often intend that the feedback they provide on students’ flawed proofs will promote proof comprehension. In this theoretical article, we investigate how such feedback can be formulated. Drawing on Lakatos’s process of proof and refutation, we propose the notion of heuristic refutation feedback for feedback on a flawed proof that contains a mathematical argument, possibly incomplete, that logically implies that the student’s proof is invalid. Such feedback is heuristic in the sense that interpreting and utilizing it invites mathematical reasoning that can contribute to development of proof comprehension. We build on Toulmin’s model of argumentation to analyze possible variations in the formulation of feedback. Based on data from a Real-Analysis course, we highlight two key decisions entailed in formulating refutation feedback: deciding what flawed (possibly implicit) claim in the student’s proof to refute, and deciding how explicitly to present the various elements of the refutation argument. We exemplify these decisions in two particular types of refutation feedback that we have identified: refutation by counter-example and refutation by false implication. We show how different formulations of refutation feedback may afford different opportunities for student-engagement with particular facets of proof comprehension. Our findings suggest how professors can purposefully tailor feedback in order to achieve particular didactic goals.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study documents the resources U.S. colleges and universities offer to address student food and housing insecurity and explores differences across community colleges, four-year public schools, and four-year private schools. Using a stratified random sample (n = 448) of U.S. postsecondary institutions, a systematic web search for evidence of 18 resources was conducted. A framework for classifying resources was developed. Logistic regression was used to explore differences by institution type. Eighty-eight percent of the schools in the sample offered at least one resource. On average, schools offered four resources. Food pantries were the most frequently offered resource, while providing information about low-cost campus dining options was the least frequently offered. Four-year private schools offered fewer resources than four-year public schools and community colleges.

          Abstract
                  <p>During the last decades, the study of how learners and teachers of mathematics use the resource of language has contributed to our understanding of mathematics teaching and learning in a variety of classrooms and cultures. Developmental work with mathematics teachers on the particular resource of mathematics teaching talk is more recent. In order to explore responses related to the importance of this talk, in this paper we consider three sites of practice in mathematics education—research, professional development and teaching—and illustrations of data from or about them, including studies from the literature, and work with secondary school mathematics teachers in Catalonia-Spain and Malawi around the teaching of angles. We argue that tensions permeate these sites of practice when a focus is placed on word use, specifically the practices of naming and explaining, in mathematics teaching talk. We conclude that the importance of mathematics teaching talk is construed through tensions with other resources in language and teaching. Tensions specifically appear in the realisation of mathematics teaching talk as mediational in the work with mathematics teachers on their classroom teaching.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>Our study aims to determine how Habermas’ construct of rationality can serve to identify and interpret the difficulties experienced by university students in the mathematical problem-solving process. To this end, a problem which required modelling and solving a differential equation was used. The problem-solving processes of university students were analysed based on rationality components. The findings demonstrated that the problems in epistemic rationality such as predominance of the figure over the definition and/or theorems, use of dogmatic knowledge, intuitive generalizations, lack of prior knowledge, incorrect recognition of the differential equation prevented the choosing and using of an appropriate problem-solving method, leading to problems in teleological rationality. It was determined that the student performance in communicative rationality was negatively affected by problems in epistemic rationality such as using of knowledge acquired by rote and predominance of figure prototype on the definitions and/or theorems. Throughout the analysis, it is required to define two new sub-components, named “geometric” and “algebraic” representation under the modelling requirements of epistemic rationality. It is advised to use the extended version of Habermas’ construct of rationality to examine the performance of students in mathematical activities to get more detailed and accurate results.</p>

                  <p>Makerspaces, Innovation and Science Education: How, Why, and What For? is an attempt to interrogate questions about the history, philosophy, and sociology of science and schooling that have long troubled science educators. In crafting the book, the author, Michael Tan, uses the microcosm of makerspaces to move back and forth to interrogate questions about the nature of knowledge, nature of science, nature of pedagogy, and nature of schooling best suited for the times we live in. In the seven chapters that comprise the book, the author has worked out a consistent framework to answer these questions. This framework represents a strong academic opinion that is thought provoking.</p>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the development, structure, and continuous improvement model of an Action Research education doctorate program research methodology course sequence. The aim of the study is to articulate a rigorous Action Research methodology course sequence and the collaborative faculty process utilized to create and continuously improve upon the research curriculum. The doctoral program under study utilizes a qualitative-dominant Action Research methodology as its signature pedagogy, integrating cycles of research into coursework before students implement and evaluate their action steps. To ensure students receive a thorough understanding of Action Research methodology, the program requires a four-research course sequence. These courses have been designed with a scaffolded approach that progressively reinforces and extends Action Research methods in ways that promote change agency, inclusivity, and social justice. This research course sequence is designed to build a rigorous foundation for students to conduct high quality Action Research that impacts their professional practice and academic scholarship and leads to transformative learning experiences for students, faculty, organizations, and communities.

          Abstract
                  <p>In recent years, numeracy has had an increasing focus in the Australian educational system, with policies and assessments in place for both students and teachers. In order to address the requirements of their careers, teachers need to have sufficient numeracy capabilities. In our study, we explored the numeracy capabilities of post-graduate pre-service teachers enrolled in a numeracy unit at an Australian university. Specifically, we investigated participants’ statistical literacy capabilities by examining responses to a multi-part question involving the analysis of Australian National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) data presented graphically. Participants’ multiple-choice answers were analysed quantitatively. To assess the depth of participants’ statistical literacy reasoning, the explanations for their responses were analysed qualitatively using an adaptation of the Structure of Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy levels. Although the vast majority of participants exhibited strong basic statistical literacy skills, few participants demonstrated high-level statistical reasoning. Surprisingly, there were few differences in the response patterns of participants who had or had not studied university mathematics in their undergraduate studies.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>This study explores the epistemic considerations that seemed to govern thirty-one Indian teachers’ beliefs while teaching certain concepts of probability, especially using random generators. It focuses on knowing how these teachers make transitions between the different interpretations of probability, namely, Logical (sometimes also known as Classical), Empirical, Subjective, and Propensity. Following the tenets of the interpretative paradigm, design tasks have been used in this study to know the selected teachers’ prevalent epistemic considerations as they worked with an isomorphic resource that has characteristics similar to a commonly used object to teach randomness, the cube. Sequencing the pedagogic strategies that teachers suggested while working with unfamiliar objects (in teaching probability) helped in unraveling their dispositions of the perceptual properties, structural aspects of the object, and other externally generating conditions as determinants for their probabilistic deductions. The study concludes that perceptual reasoning that emerges by analyzing the physical and generating conditions of the activity during an experiment serve as tools on which further probabilistic deductions get based.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined bias reduction in the eight nonequivalent comparison group designs (NECGDs) that result from combining (a) choice of a local versus non-local comparison group, and analytic use or not of (b) a pretest measure of the study outcome and (c) a rich set of other covariates. Bias was estimated as the difference in causal estimate between each NECGD and a carefully appraised randomized experiment with the same intervention, outcome, and estimand. Results indicated that bias generally declined with the number of design elements in an NECGD, that combining all three sufficed to eliminate bias but was not necessary for it, and that this pattern of results was largely replicated across five different replication factors.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Even though there has been increasing interest in the role of cognition in leadership and in identifying the personality traits of effective leaders, there is a paucity of studies that investigate the unique influence of managers’ trait affectivity and cognitive ability on their different risk and time preferences. This paper investigates the role of managers’ trait affectivity and cognitive ability in their loss aversion and present bias among 623 top managers at textile and garment firms in Vietnam. We combine data on preferences elicited through a lab-in-the-field experiment with survey data. We find that managers with high positive affectivity (PA) or cognitive ability are less subject to loss aversion and present bias. In contrast, a manager with high negative affectivity (NA) is more likely to be impatient and loss averse. Furthermore, heterogeneity of trait affectivity and cognitive ability determines different loss aversion and present bias levels of managers in SMEs vis-à-vis their counterparts in large firms. Remarkably, we observe striking evidence that trait affectivity and cognitive ability significantly affect loss aversion and present bias levels of managers who were born during the Vietnam War. Still, it is not the story of their counterparts born after the Vietnam War. The results of our study are expected to provide valuable information regarding the role played by trait affectivity and cognitive ability in determining managers’ loss aversion and present bias in different pathways.
