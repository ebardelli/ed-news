  Abstract
      
                    <p>Students’ issues dealing with reflection tasks, especially with inclined mirror lines, are widely known. Previous research conducted with primary school students mainly focussed on task difficulty and students’ outcomes, especially their errors of reflection. Little is known about which not obviously sustainable understanding of reflection leads to what kind of errors. To address this issue, the purpose of this study is to explore which approaches students use in their solution finding processes when dealing with reflection tasks. We also investigated whether there was a relationship between the students’ approaches and correct or incorrect solution products. This article discusses a task-based interview study focussing on approaches used in the students’ solution process of four reflection tasks. To gather data, 42 interviews with students at the end of primary school in Germany were conducted. For the analysis, a category system with the categories “properties of reflection,” “holistic approaches,” “gestures and actions illustrating the process of reflection,” and “mental images illustrating the process of reflection,” was developed and validated. We observed that there is a relation between the approaches used by the students during their process of solving reflection tasks and their solution products. The observed relationship between the approaches applied during the solution processes and the solutions themselves leads to the assumption that the approaches the students used reveal varying degrees of mathematical understanding of reflection. As emphasized in the discussion of the results, it is important to take a differentiated look on the students’ solution products and the importance of adequate instruction methods.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>In this article, we report on a typology of the demands of statistical and mathematical products (StaMPs) embedded in media items related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The typology emerged from a content analysis of a large purposive sample of diverse media items selected from digital news sources based in four countries. The findings encompass nine categories of StaMPs: (1) descriptive quantitative information, (2) models, predictions, causality and risk, (3) representations and displays, (4) data quality and strength of evidence, (5) demographics and comparative thinking, (6) heterogeneity and contextual factors, (7) literacy and language demands, (8) multiple information sources, and (9) critical demands. We illustrate these categories via selected media items, substantiate them through relevant research literature, and point to categories that encompass new or enhanced types of demands. Our findings offer insights into the rich set of capabilities that citizens (including both young people and adults) must possess in order to engage these mass media demands, critically analyze statistical and mathematical information in the media, evaluate the meaning and credibility of news reports, understand public policies, and make evidenced-informed judgments. Our conclusions point to the need to revise current curricular frameworks and conceptual models (e.g., regarding statistical and probability literacy, adult numeracy), to better incorporate notions such as blended knowledge, vagueness, risk, strength of evidence, and criticality. Furthermore, more attention is needed to the literacy and language demands of media items involving statistical and mathematical information. Implications for further research and educational practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Variance and invariance are two powerful mathematical ideas to support geometrical and spatial thinking, yet there is limited research about teachers’ knowledge of variance and invariance. In this paper, we examined how high school teachers deal with the task of looking for invariant properties in a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) setting. Specifically, we investigated if they even attend to invariant properties; what invariant properties they discern and discuss; and how DGE can support such discernment. Our analysis found that teachers tend to discern and discuss invariant properties mainly when they were probed to consider invariance. We also found four categories of invariant properties that seem to be important for a robust and rich understanding of geometric objects in the context of invariance and DGE. The use of DGE allowed teachers to see and interact with invariant properties, thus suggesting that accessing geometry dynamically may have structural affordances especially when exploring invariance. Teachers were able to enact different DGE movements to discern and discuss invariant properties, as well as to reason with and about them. We also saw that teachers’ backgrounds and past experiences can play an important role in their descriptions of invariant properties. Possible future research directions and implications to teacher education are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>In mathematics education research, proofs are often conceptualized as sequences of mathematical assertions. We argue that this ignores proofs that contain instructions to perform mathematical actions, often in the form of imperatives, which are common both in mathematical practice and in undergraduate mathematics textbooks. We consider in detail a specific type of proof which we call a recipe proof, which is comprised of sequence of instructions that direct the reader to produce mathematical objects with desirable properties. We present a model of what it means to understand a recipe proof and use this model in conjunction with process-object theories from mathematics education research, to explain why recipe proofs are inherently difficult for students to understand.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>Drawing bar diagrams has been shown to improve performance on mathematical word problems wherein the relational keyword is consistent with the required arithmetic operation. This study extends this by testing the effectiveness of bar diagram drawing for word problems with an inconsistent keyword-arithmetic operation mapping. Seventy-five fifth graders solved consistent and inconsistent word problems while encouraged to draw bar diagrams. For each word problem, we assessed problem type (consistent/inconsistent), performance (correct/incorrect), and bar diagrams (accurate/inaccurate/no drawing). Overall, bar diagram drawing was associated with increased performance on both consistent and inconsistent word problems, but the strongest benefits of drawing were found for inconsistent word problems. For inconsistent word problems, bar diagram accuracy was more clearly related to performance (accurate bar diagrams related to correct answers, but inaccurate ones to incorrect answers) than for consistent word problems. We conclude that bar diagram drawing provides an effective graphical support for solving inconsistent word problems.</p>

Using thematic analysis, we examined whether sameness was viewed as helpful or harmful for isomorphism and homomorphism before examining rationales for those views. Making use of values of the mathematical community, we note that mathematicians saw conceptual and pedagogical benefits to connecting isomorphism and sameness, which connects to leveraging intuition and valuing ways of increasing understanding. Mathematicians’ concerns around using sameness largely revolved around the violation of the mathematical community’s idealized value of expressing a priori truth via a-contextual justifications. However, these concerns can be addressed through only targeted usage of sameness and explicit discussions around the utility and relevance of sameness. Implications include the importance of considering how interventions proposed by mathematics educators align with or provoke tension between values held by the mathematical community in order to mitigate or lean into those tensions and encourage fruitful dialogue between the mathematics and mathematics education communities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence, attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary classrooms.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Within educational research, dyslexia and other disabilities are typically conceptualized as deficits. The theory of neurodiversity encourages researchers to conceptualize cognitive differences as natural forms of human diversity with unique sets of challenges and strengths. Using neurodiversity as our theoretical framework, we analyze the experiences of five research mathematicians with dyslexia as told through personal narratives to find common strengths and challenges for dyslexic thinkers at the highest level of mathematics. We report on 4 themes: (1) highly visual and intuitive ways of mathematical thinking, (2) issues with language and translation between forms, (3) issues with memorization of mathematical facts and procedures, and (4) resilience as a strength of dyslexia that matters in mathematics. We use our participants’ insights to explore how neurodiversity, a theory of cognitive disability developed by and for neurodiverse people, could expand opportunities for research. We call for mathematics educators to consider the strengths and challenges of dyslexic learners, as well as valuing expertise from insider perspectives.</p>

Our research took place at a 2-week workshop on inner model theory, a topic of set theory, which was largely comprised of a series of lectures. We asked the six workshop organizers and seven conference attendees what could be learned from the lectures in the workshop, and from mathematics lectures in general. A key finding was that participants felt the motivation and road maps that were provided by the lecturers could facilitate the attendees’ future individual studying of the material. We conclude by discussing how our findings inform the development of theory on how individuals can learn from lectures and suggest interesting directions for future research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper focuses on the importance of covariational reasoning within the processes of mathematics teaching and learning. Despite the internationally recognized relevance of covariation, research shows that only a small percentage of students and teachers is able to adopt covariational reasoning and the majority of mathematics curricula do not contain explicit references to covariational skills. In particular, when covariational reasoning manifests as conceptual knowledge, it becomes challenging to assess, and the need for innovative methods of assessment emerges; there is a need for suitable assessment to highlight the characteristics of covariation and capture the various features that characterize conceptual understanding. Comparative judgement (CJ) is an innovative assessment method based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than requiring scoring rubrics. Due to its holistic approach, CJ is particularly suitable for assessing complex mathematical competencies, and, as we shall see in this study, it proved to be appropriate for the covariation’s assessment. In details, our study aims to investigate the perception and relevance attributed by mathematics teachers to covariation as a theoretical construct and the way CJ can help in the assessment of covariational reasoning skills underlying a less structured modelling task.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Multiple representations can enhance students’ understanding of mathematical concepts and complex information but can also pose well-documented challenges for students. Whereas instructional designs have been optimized to support students’ learning with multiple representations, little is known about supportive teaching practices for dealing with multiple representations in whole-class discussions. In this article, we qualitatively investigate two cases of teacher-student interaction in whole-class discussions in grades 10–12 (about the mathematical topic of complex conditional probability information). The analysis aims at decomposing the teaching practices into those actions that can support or hinder students’ understanding. The comparison of cases reveals that teaching practices can vary greatly: simply translating compacted concepts of a given text into other representations (visual area model, symbolic representation of fractions, and three language varieties) seems to be sufficient for students with advanced understanding. Other students need teachers’ supportive actions for unfolding the highly compacted concepts (such as part-of-part) into several concept elements (part, whole, and part-whole relationship) and explicitly connecting (rather than only translating) the concept elements in multiple representations for the different concept elements. The findings can inform both theory building on teaching practices with multiple representations and professional development.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many districts and states have implemented incentives to recruit teachers to low-performing schools, and previous research has found evidence that these incentives are effective at attracting teachers. However, effects on the schools and students these teachers leave behind have not been examined. This study focuses on the spillover effects of recruiting effective teachers to Tennessee’s Innovation Zone (iZone) schools. We find the short-term effects of losing these teachers range from −0.04 to −0.12 SDs in student test score gains, with larger negative effects when more effective teachers leave. However, combining both these negative effects in schools teachers leave and the positive effects in iZone schools yields overall net positive effects.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Colleges and universities are legally required to attempt to prevent and redress sexual violations on campus. Neo-institutional theory suggests that the implementation of law by compliance professionals rarely achieves law’s goals. It is critical in claims-based systems that those who are potential claimants understand the law. This article demonstrates that (a) intended subjects of the law (colleges and universities) interpret and frame the law in very similar ways; (b) resultant policies are complex and difficult to navigate; and (c) university undergraduates in an experimental setting are not able to comprehend the Title IX policies designed to protect them. These findings suggest that current implementations of Title IX policies leave them structurally ineffective to combat sexual assaults on campus.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Philanthropic initiatives incorporating prescriptive practices have become prominent in K–12 education. This study provides evidence on the reach, character, and impact of the Broad Superintendents Academy, a controversial initiative designed to transform district leadership. A novel data set on Broad trainees linked to data on large districts over 20 years shows that Broad superintendents have had extensive reach, serving nearly 3 million students at their peak, and that, for districts that hired Broad trainees, Broad superintendents were 40% more likely to be Black than non-Broad superintendents, although they had significantly shorter tenures. Estimates provide evidence that Broad-trained leaders had little effect on several district outcomes including enrollment, spending, and student completion. However, they initiated a trend toward increased charter school enrollment.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>This study aimed to explore preservice elementary teachers’ use of a bar model as a heuristic for conceptualising relationships between quantities in situations involving ratio and percentages. As a part of a larger project, we focused on two preservice teachers, Maia and Jane, and investigated their solution paths in ratio and percentage problems and the role of the structural representations (i.e., bar model and percent line-bar model) in their solution paths. We analysed these focus participants’ written solutions and their think-aloud process during interviews using three coding phases with a constructivist grounded theory approach. We observed that the problem text fed the construction of the structural representations that served to make sense of the quantities and the relationships among them. Furthermore, the structural representations enhanced Maia and Jane’s mathematical insights about the problem situations. In addition, we observed that preservice teachers’ solution paths were neither linear nor similar, which indicates a mathematical richness in learning. In those solution paths, the model construction played a role in guiding the mathematical operations of constructing and operating on a unit rate in the ratio problem and identifying and operating on a referent whole unit in the percentage problem. We interpreted that variety and nonlinearity in solution paths suggested mathematical richness in learning, the educational implications of which were further discussed.</p>

Previously, we found that teachers gave lower priority to racial equity when disparities were framed as “achievement gaps” (AGs) versus “inequality in educational outcomes.” In this brief, we analyze data from two survey experiments using a teacher sample and an Amazon MTurk sample. We find that (a) the effect of AG language on equity prioritization is moderated by implicit bias, with larger negative effects among teachers holding stronger anti-Black/pro-White stereotypes; (b) the negative effect of AG language replicates with non-teachers; and (c) AG language causes respondents to express more negative racial stereotypes.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the nonpartisan research and analytical arm of the U.S. Congress and is physically and structurally located within the Library of Congress. Despite the role of CRS as a critical information provider and technical assistant to actors crafting and implementing federal policy, CRS reports, which serve as a key mechanism of information dissemination and influence by the organization, only became widely available to the public following the adoption of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. This study uses content analysis to examine CRS’s education-related reports from the 115th Congress to explore what sources are directly and indirectly informing federal policymaking based on references in CRS reports. Findings offer insights into research utilization in the federal education policy process and contribute to the growing literature on intermediary organizations and knowledge brokering.
