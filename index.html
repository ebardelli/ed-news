  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This AERA Open special topic concerns the large emerging research area of education data science (EDS). In a narrow sense, EDS applies statistics and computational techniques to educational phenomena and questions. In a broader sense, it is an umbrella for a fleet of new computational techniques being used to identify new forms of data, measures, descriptives, predictions, and experiments in education. Not only are old research questions being analyzed in new ways but also new questions are emerging based on novel data and discoveries from EDS techniques. This overview defines the emerging field of education data science and discusses 12 articles that illustrate an AERA-angle on EDS. Our overview relates a variety of promises EDS poses for the field of education as well as the areas where EDS scholars could successfully focus going forward.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Encouraging school engagement is crucial to promoting positive outcomes for high school students. One potential means to promote school engagement may be through career and technical education (CTE) coursework, which is specifically designed to be educationally engaging, particularly for vulnerable populations such as those from low-income backgrounds. Yet, little is known about whether these courses do in fact link to higher school engagement. Through analysis of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009—a nationally representative data set—we explored the link between STEM-focused CTE (STEM-CTE) coursetaking and school engagement for low-income students. To do so, we employed an instrumental variable estimation technique and found that taking STEM-CTE courses related to higher school engagement for low-income students. We conclude with a discussion of implications for students, practitioners, and policymakers.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>What difference do open educational resources (OER) make compared with publisher content (non-OER) when costs and instructors remain constant? A total of 215 community college students enrolled in online, introductory courses were randomly assigned to OER or non-OER sections and compared on retention at the tuition drop date, completion with a C or better, course completion, and mean final exam scores. Students in the OER sections were retained and persisted at a statistically significant higher rate, lending credibility to the findings of former studies regarding retention and persistence rates in courses taught with OER materials. No statistically significant differences were found on completion rates or final exam scores. OER course materials should be considered in broader initiatives for student success in community colleges.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite widespread acknowledgment of teachers of Color as critical agents of change, white supremacist, colonial, and cis-heteropatriarchal ontologies of “teacher leadership” marginalize the counterhegemonic leadership they embody. Guided by critical leadership and feminist of Color scholarship, I develop and employ an embodied raciolinguistic analysis to examine how a Latina teacher leader of Color facilitated organization-wide action in the educational interests of Black students. My analysis demonstrates that her discursive and embodied practices as a non-Black woman of Color and “official” teacher leader were simultaneously (re)constructed as catalysts and hindrance for racial progress within and across social spaces. Grappling with these possibilities and tensions at interpersonal, institutional, and societal scales, she reflexively adapted her practices to recenter Black leadership while facing professional consequences. Arguing for radical social change by amplifying the multi-faceted and contested nature of counterhegemonic teacher leadership, I offer implications to foster the critical ingenuity needed to lead in love, solidarity, and justice for and among communities of Color.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Principals are the second-largest school-based contributor to K–12 students’ academic progress. However, there is little research evaluating whether efforts to develop principals’ skills improve school effectiveness. We conducted randomized controlled trial studies of the impacts of a professional development program called the Executive Development Program (EDP) and of the incremental effects of coaching to help principals implement the EDP curriculum. We find that the EDP alone influenced principals’ practices, but not student achievement, within 3 years. Coaching had a small positive effect on students’ English Language Arts achievement, but no effect on math achievement or on principals’ practices. Coaching had the largest effects in disadvantaged schools. We hypothesize that coaching enhanced the quality of implementation of recommended practices.

  Abstract
                  <p>Creativity has been identified as a key characteristic that allows students to adapt smoothly to rapid societal and economic changes in the real world. However, Chinese students appear to perform less well in mathematical problem-solving and problem-posing abilities, which are strongly connected to mathematical creativity. Mathematical modelling has recently been introduced as one of the six core competencies in the Chinese mathematical curriculum and is built on students’ ability to solve real-world problems using mathematical means. As mathematical modelling is characterised by openness regarding the understanding of complex real-world problems and the complex relationship between the real world and mathematics, for the strengthening of creativity, mathematical modelling activities seem to be adequate to accomplish this purpose. In this paper, we describe a study with 71 upper secondary school students, 50 pre-service mathematics teachers, and 66 in-service mathematics teachers, based on an extended didactical framework regarding mathematical modelling as a creativity-demanding activity. The results of the study indicate a significant correlation between modelling competencies and creativity aspects. Especially significant correlations between the adequacy of the modelling approaches and the two creativity aspects of usefulness and fluency could be identified, as well as a significant negative correlation between usefulness and originality. The results of the correlational analysis of relationships among the four criteria were not always consistent in the three participant groups. Overall, the results have implications for the promotion of creativity for various expertise groups and demonstrate the dependency of the modelling activities on the mathematical knowledge of the participants and the mathematical topic with which they are dealing.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As data are ‘numbers with context’ (Cobb &amp; Moore, 1997), contextual knowledge plays a prominent role in dealing with statistics. While insights about a specific context can further the depth of interpreting and evaluating outcomes of data analysis, research shows how it can also hinder relying on data especially if results differ from expectations. In this article, the aim is to investigate how young students informally deal with empirical evidence, which differs from their initial expectations in a specific context. We present a case study with three pairs of students at the age of 9 to 10 who compare groups in survey datasets. The interpretative analysis shows how conjectures of varying degrees of confidence shape the students’ statistical expectations and can play different roles in interpreting results from data analysis.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Programs that provide underserved populations with access to high-quality mathematics through workshops, clubs, and classroom observations (Civil, Stoehr, &amp; Salazar, 2019; Civil &amp; Bernier, 2006; Diaz-Palomar, Menendez, &amp; Civil, 2011; Jimenez-Castellanos, Ochoa, &amp; Olivos, 2016; Muir,  2011, 2012; Quintos, Civil, &amp; Bratton, 2019) are vital. The community mathematics project (CMP) is one such program that takes a holistic approach to transforming mathematics education. Through partnerships with local institutions, the CMP pairs a prospective teacher (PT) with a parent for online mathematics tutoring sessions. This study describes how PTs in the CMP supported parents’ mathematics development of sense-making (Odden &amp; Russ, 2017) in mathematics by providing relevant tasks, employing multiple strategies, using virtual manipulatives, and questioning in one–one-one tutoring sessions. Findings suggest that this type of field experience with an explicit focus on a sense-making approach supported PTs in learning mathematics, engaging in partnerships with parents and members of the community, and attending broader issues of social contexts of learning. Further, PTs attended to individual considerations such as sequencing and scaffolding, relevancy of the content, task development, and building towards common mathematical practices. Finally, onsite coaching and tutoring experiences were formative in developing essential skills for teaching mathematics in elementary school in the following areas: content and pedagogical content knowledge, development of core pedagogical practices, funds of knowledge approaches and collaboration with families, and dispositions toward (teaching) mathematics such as reframing mistakes, emphasis on sense-making, and co-construction of knowledge.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past several decades large philanthropies have adopted aggressive approaches to education reform that scholars have labeled venture philanthropy. These efforts focused on broad changes to schooling and education policy, borrowing techniques from the venture capital world. But many foundations have recently become convinced that market forces and macro-level policymaking alone cannot drive educational improvement, particularly in areas related to classroom teaching and learning. In response, foundations have begun to design their own instructional innovations and identify providers to implement them. This paper interprets these recent efforts as early evidence of a distinct adaptation in the evolving role of philanthropies, which we dub design philanthropy. Although this approach represents an attempt by foundations to simultaneously increase democratic engagement, directly influence the instructional core, and spur educational innovation, it poses new risks for coherence, scalability, and sustainability in education policymaking.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>The future is dependent on the STEM graduate education system, emphasizing the importance of STEM graduate programs in producing highly trained expert researchers. The cognitive apprenticeship (CA) framework provides guidance to experts (i.e., faculty) on how to explicate their knowledge through the creation of learning opportunities that foster and support students in developing expertise in a particular discipline. This review examines the current landscape of research focused on the use of the CA framework in STEM graduate education. The research suggests the CA framework is a useful and effective model for supporting faculty in cultivating rich learning opportunities for STEM graduate students.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This study used two training sessions and two focus groups with 17 preservice teachers (aged 20–36) completing their first teaching practicum placement during their Bachelor of Education program at an urban research university in western Canada. The aim was to implement ideas from terror management theory (TMT) during their teaching practicum. Participants explored how to facilitate contentious issues so as to prevent defensive reactions when worldviews clash in the classroom. A dramaturgical analysis identified participant objectives, conflicts, tactics, attitudes, emotions, and subtexts as they explored how to anticipate and avoid worldview and self-esteem threat, navigate tense pedagogical spaces, build capacity for expressing uncomfortable emotions, and diffuse threat with humor. Because difficult emotions are central to teaching potentially polarizing content, participating preservice teachers explored when compensatory reactions might emerge and, as a result, developed their own emotional awareness—TMT became both an experience and a teachable theory.
