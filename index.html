  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>While educators’ uses of social media for purposes such as professional learning and networking are now well-established, our understanding of how educational institutions use social media—including to engage key stakeholders during periods of crisis—is limited. In this study, we used a public data mining research approach to examine how K–12 school districts in the United States used Twitter as a communication tool during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic, March-April, 2020. Through a three-step grounded theory approach of 1,357 district tweets from 492 school districts, we found that districts worked to build community and share time-sensitive announcements in alignment with social media crisis communication recommendations. Announcements were more common during the early stages of the pandemic (and were engaged more collaboratively), with community-building posts more common later on. This study demonstrates how researchers can use publicly available (social media) data to understand districts’ communication priorities and strategies during and beyond periods of crisis.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>To systematically explore the structural racism that teacher educators of Color endure, this article uses a critical race theory lens to analyze the findings from qualitative questionnaires with 141 Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Asian American teacher educators who work in diverse universities across the United States. We learned that many of the participants in our study were hired to teach race and racism among race-evasive colleagues and predominantly white students that are enabled to protect and leverage their whiteness. As we frame their experiences, we argue that teacher education programs are, in fact, structured for teacher educators of Color to experience racial stress and harm. We end by suggesting steps teacher education programs can take to advance racial justice.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Policymaking is not linear or neutral, nor is it ever made or enacted in isolation, especially not during a crisis. Framed by theories on the contextual, interactive nature of policy enactment, this year-long, ethnographic study examined how an urban elementary school and nonprofit organization worked to address challenges made visible by the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses explored how negotiations among the school, its nonprofit partner, and district shaped pandemic policy responses. Data included 35 transcriptions and eight field notes from stakeholder interviews and principal–partner meetings, and 128 external stakeholder artifacts. Findings showcase the policy enactment of family–school communication and access to remote learning, and limitations of the partnership due to structural and racialized processes. The discussion presents implications for educational policymaking in response to crises, highlighting the need to understand the external contexts and racialized discourses that are part of shaping those responses to be dynamic and “nonlinear.”

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Resource exposure was a key mechanism linking patterns of racial segregation and student outcomes during the Brown v. Board of Education era. Decades later, past progress on school desegregation may have stalled, raising concerns about resource equity and associated student outcomes. Are recent trends in segregation associated with racial disparities in district revenue? Drawing on national data from the School Funding Fairness Data System and the Common Core of Data, this study examines the association between contemporary patterns of segregation between districts within a state and racial disparities in school district revenue over time. We find that increases in racial segregation, net of racial socioeconomic segregation, and other racial differences between districts are associated with racial disparities in revenue.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past three decades, children from low-income families have increasingly been attending different public schools than those from more affluent families. Though recent work has helped us understand patterns of income segregation between districts and schools within districts, we know little about segregation of students as they experience school: in the classroom. We attempt to advance knowledge of segregation of students by income at the classroom level. We use data from North Carolina that includes information on classroom assignments and students’ economically disadvantaged (ED) status. We assess whether ED students are clustered/segregated into different classrooms than other students. We find that within-school segregation rose by about 10% between 2007 and 2014 in elementary and middle schools we study.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In 2021, only a few locally led peacebuilding institutions worked to build bridges across the Armenian–Azerbaijani conflict that had divided the two societies for over three decades. This stood in sharp contrast with the recent past, when the environment was saturated by civil society institutions promoting peace and cross-border co-operation. The reasons for the dissipation of the once-vibrant scene of institutionalized peacebuilding included the decreased European and US support for democratization and civil society, the crackdown on and stigmatization of peacebuilding, military escalation, and the Second Karabakh War. The collapse of the professionalized scene, however, was not the end of peacebuilding. As institutions retreated, decentralized online networks connecting Armenians and Azerbaijanis sprang into existence. The article explores the journey of Caucasus Edition, a peacebuilding journal, whose ongoing reflection and action cycle process led it to transform from a professional institution into a decentralized transnational network. It highlights the relative effectiveness of decentralized structures, particularly their resiliency and adaptability, compared to professionalized civil society institutions susceptible to cooptation or crackdown in non-democratic political environments.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The use of vlogs is promising in participatory action research (PAR) that aims to enhance the health and well-being of citizens. Vlogs have the potential to reach a wide audience, transcending the local scale of PAR. This article aims to explore the value of co-creating vlogs by investigating two exploratory studies involving adolescents and women from disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We reflected on the co-creation of vlogs by community members and professionals. The results show that co-creating vlogs enabled meaningful engagement of citizens living in vulnerable circumstances and promoted shared learning. Community members who were not involved in the vlog creation were critical of the vlogs. However, watching the vlogs stimulated discussion and reflection. Therefore, dissemination of vlogs in a setting guided by a professional seems to have the potential to facilitate shared learning. Despite the popularity of vlogs, this study highlights the need to carefully consider the use of vlogs in relation to a study’s aims and to respond to (ethical) concerns.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Antiblack geopolitics and educational policies continue to produce oppressive systems, making it difficult for educators to acknowledge Black families’ actions as contributions to produce equitable education. Policy processes have the potential to transform oppressive systems of power. Conceptualizing policy as a practice of power permits local policy actors to use their individualized power to shift a policy’s course of action and transform oppressive educational systems. With an anticolonial framework and using an institutional ethnography, this inquiry explores Black mothers’ actions as policy actors. Findings detail the mothers’ relentless invitation to allow their darkskinned agentic power to collaborate with their school district and form a teacher-recruitment program. The mothers’ policy actions are exemplary of the abilities to transform policy processes ridden with antiblack geopolitics that ignore the voices of BIPOC individuals. This project illustrates the daily antiblackness individuals endure before and while enlisting as educational partners and policy actors.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Improv theater has expanded beyond a popular American form of entertainment into an educational experience for students and teachers. It may be difficult to imagine that an interactive, joyful, and collaborative improv workshop might be harmful, but our own experiences as professional improvisers led us to observe that even well-intentioned, antiracist improv theater interventions tend to reflect Whiteness more than democratic values. We investigate this observation through a systematic review of education research articles. Our review of 30 studies reveals that, to varying degrees, researchers have regarded improvisation as an instrumental practice to improve some other activity or as metaphor for the activity of teaching. We found that Whiteness has been central to the use of improvisation in educational contexts. Finally, this study illustrates that a turn toward disciplined improvisation or an improvisational ethos offers one way to practice the ideals of democratic education.

  Abstract
                  <p>Research has revealed the extent and mechanism of the relation between language (dominated by alphabetic systems) and students’ mathematics learning, but when it comes to Chinese language (an orthographic system), nature remains elusive. In this meta-analysis we aim to quantify the size of the relation between Chinese language and mathematics and determine the mechanism under which the correlation works. With a random effect model, a moderate relation (r = 0.36, 95%CI [0.34, 0.38]) between Chinese language and mathematics was identified in 34 studies with 27 unique samples and 58,995 participants. Both dimensions of Chinese language and domains of mathematics were verified as significant moderators. Differences and commonalities of the relation between (Chinese) language and mathematics were discussed compared with existing meta-analyses. The findings suggested that consistent with alphabetic languages such as English, Chinese phonological processing, especially Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) had the weakest correlation with mathematics, while oral comprehension and comprehensive language produced the strongest relations with mathematics; and Chinese language had the strongest correlation with comprehensive mathematics. Compared with alphabetic languages, Chinese language showed a stronger correlation with calculations; Chinese RAN showed a weaker correlation with mathematics, while Chinese orthographic-related skills produced a superior correlation with mathematics. Research implications were also suggested.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Educators in economically and racially segregated schools enact subgroup entitlement policies, such as Title III and IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), as they negotiate the diverse and underserved needs throughout the student body. How do subgroup entitlement policies for English learners and students with disabilities shape daily opportunity provision—the day-to-day distribution of resources—in segregated schools? This ethnographic study of a public middle school reveals that the implementation of subgroup entitlement policies shaped the opportunity structure for all students through (1) creating tracks that offered distinct conditions for learning, (2) fragmenting the organizational structure and inhibiting coordination, (3) exposing the school to increased compliance pressure that hierarchized priorities, and (4) utilizing subgroup-specific resources for general education students.
