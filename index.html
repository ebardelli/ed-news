  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article presents a latent class model for multilevel data to identify latent subgroups and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. Unlike sequential approaches that partition data first and then estimate average treatment effects (ATEs) within classes, we employ a Bayesian procedure to jointly estimate mixing probability, selection, and outcome models so that misclassification does not obstruct estimation of treatment effects. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method finds the correct number of latent classes, estimates class-specific treatment effects well, and provides proper posterior standard deviations and credible intervals of ATEs. We apply this method to Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data to investigate the effects of private science lessons on achievement scores and then find two latent classes, one with zero ATE and the other with positive ATE.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article is concerned with a subset of numerically stable and scalable algorithms useful to support computationally complex psychometric models in the era of machine learning and massive data. The subset selected here is a core set of numerical methods that should be familiar to computational psychometricians and considers whitening transforms for dealing with correlated data, computational concepts for linear models, multivariable integration, and optimization techniques.

  Abstract
                  <p>The success or failure of education systems in promoting student problem-solving skills depends on attitudinal, political, and pedagogical variables. Among these variables, the design of mathematics textbooks is thought to partially explain why students from high-achieving countries show better problem-solving ability in international assessments. In the current study, we delved into this question and compared the frequency and characteristics of arithmetic word problems (AWPs) contained in primary school math textbooks in two countries with different levels of performance in international assessments—Singapore and Spain. In our analyses, we focused on (1) the quantity of arithmetic word problems, (2) the variety of problems in terms of their additive or multiplicative structures and semantic-mathematical substructures, and (3) the quantity and nature of illustrations that were presented together with arithmetic word problems. Although a larger proportion of AWP activities was found in Singaporean textbooks, the results showed a similar variety of AWPs in both Singaporean and Spanish math textbooks. Furthermore, in both countries, math textbooks emphasized the structures classified as (additive) combine 1 and (multiplication) simple rate in AWPs. Notably, the Singaporean textbook contained a larger percentage of illustrations that reflected the semantic-mathematical structures of the problems and helped students learn how to solve AWPs (e.g., bar models). The findings are discussed in light of theories that posit that textbooks constitute a fundamental part of the teaching–learning process in the classroom.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether exposing teachers to theoretical and empirical background information regarding pedagogical aspects of geometrical thinking would affect their noticing abilities. Forty-one in-service Mathematics teachers participated in this study. The research tools used in the study included a lesson taken from the VIDEO-LM project and articles that were all presented to the teachers. Our work with an open-ended questionnaire and mixed-methods analysis revealed that exposing in-service teachers to theoretical and empirical articles may affect the three components of their professional noticing performance: attending, interpreting, and responding. After the exposure to the articles, the teachers exhibited a greater focus on the specific difficulties inherent in the specific task at hand and their subsequent interpretations of those difficulties and responses to those difficulties were also more specific than they had been before the intervention.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent national lockdown in South Africa induced a rapid, albeit challenging, implementation of blended learning (with a strong online focus) at all educational levels. During this time, a group of teachers were involved in a specialised computer integrated education course, preparing them for the design and implementation of technologically enhanced modes of teaching. In this research we considered the positive impact of the situation during the pandemic on these mathematics teachers’ practice, as well as their conceptualisation of the way forward for technology enhanced mathematics education. We conducted an explorative survey study, employing an enactivist approach, to investigate their experiences of addressing procedural and conceptual aspects of mathematics education, as well as their observations of learners’ reactions to these changed practices. Our findings show that participants experienced their exposure to technology as creating an environment they foresee will have a lasting impact on their teaching practice. Participants emphasised the importance of using educational technology meaningfully as a cognitive tool that allows for learners to learn with the technology and not from the technology, which impacts on the importance of learner-centred teaching strategies and the development of high cognitive level interactive learning activities.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>High school Career and Technical Education (CTE) has received increased attention from policymakers and researchers in recent years. This study fills a needed gap in the growing research base by examining heterogeneity within the wide range of programs falling under the broad moniker of CTE, highlighting the need for nuance in research and policy conversations that often consider CTE as monolithic. Using student-level course-taking records, unemployment insurance, and National Student Clearinghouse data, we examine outcomes including earnings, postsecondary education, and poverty avoidance. We find substantial differences for students in fields as diverse as health care, Information Technology (IT), and construction. We also highlight heterogeneity for student populations historically overrepresented in CTE, and we find large differences in outcomes for CTE students, particularly by gender.

Low-cost technological interventions delivering personalized information and/or advising may improve refiling and academic outcomes, but questions remain regarding the efficacy of this approach at scale. This multi-pronged randomized experiment tested informational and framing text message interventions for a national sample of approximately 10,000 undergraduates. The text outreach caused earlier FAFSA re-filing for some students. However, gains in re-filing during the active intervention period were not sustained after the intervention concluded and did not translate into additional federal financial aid or improved postsecondary persistence or attainment. Implications for the scaling and targeting of nudging are discussed.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Programs that improve teaching effectiveness represent a core strategy to improve student educational outcomes and close student achievement gaps. This article compiles empirical values of intraclass correlations for designing effective and efficient experimental studies evaluating the effects of these programs. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 (ECLS-K) data are used to estimate empirical design parameter values in the setting of students nested within teachers nested within schools. The results show that intraclass correlations at the school level are relatively stable, and those at the teacher level increase along with grade level. We illustrate the utility of the results by demonstrating how to leverage this information to design more efficient and effective experimental studies.

  Abstract
                  <p>The implementation of large-scale intervention and development projects is often problematic, and the impacts of such projects usually fall somewhat short of what was expected. Additionally, the rationalities of intervention projects are not carried over into classroom teaching as directly as expected. This problem is generally known, but comprehensive explanations continue to elude the research community at large. Using the theory of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), we propose that the heart of the problem lies in the expansive learning process that teachers undergo. This process is driven by unrecognised contradictions in terms of cultural and historical origin, which are fundamentally different from the processes governing the projects. We analyze two cases taken from two large Danish professional development projects. In each case, we focus on a teacher as part of two activity systems (‘the project’ and ‘the classroom’) and how the contradictions within and between these shape learning through epistemic actions. The results indicate the importance of making these contradictions apparent and accessible to everyone in the activity systems. Because of these various contradictions, the agency conferred upon teachers leads to unintended outcomes.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>A 12-episode constructivist teaching experiment with two pairs of elementary preservice teachers was conducted to examine how they reason distributively and proportionally. Specifically, I studied how prospective teachers reason with ratios as multiplicative comparisons. Prospective teachers solved different problems in one specific context (Step Problems) that require to reason with ratios as multiplicative comparisons, and represented their pictures during the episodes and the follow-up interviews. Second-order models of four prospective teachers were made. In this study I found that reasoning with ratios as multiplicative comparisons in that specific context of problems was challenging for prospective teachers and all four had considerable difficulty. Only one of the four prospective teachers fully reasoned with ratios as multiplicative comparisons. The findings of this study provide teacher educators with a new perspective on prospective teachers’ quantitative understanding of proportional reasoning, a domain as we know little about, and has implications for the mathematical preparation of prospective elementary teachers.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>As a result of patchwork policies, early childhood education (ECE) providers combine funding from multiple sources, known as blended funding. However, little is known about the consequences of blended funding for policy goals. We use national ECE provider data to identify the prevalence of blended funding models, and detailed state quality rating data to describe the relation between funding and quality through the lens of organizational theory. We operationalize blended funding as the total number of revenue sources, which reflects participation in multiple ECE institutions. Results emphasize that combining funding from distinct ECE policies within programs is a typical practice for ECE providers, and reveal a positive association between a provider’s number of funding sources and program quality.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we aimed to inquire into the impact of the use of early arithmetic strategies by a group of fifth-grade students, on their solving of equations involving two representations of unknowns. Pre- and post-tests consisting of equation-solving items involving two representations of unknowns (number sentences containing empty ‘brackets’, as in the example 5 + (∙) = 10, or equations containing x, as in 5 + x = 10), were administered to 126 fifth-grade students in a regular class setting. We found a notable difference between students’ success rates on these two types of equations and their strategy use. Most students used the inversing strategy (arithmetic operations) after formal instruction on equation solving. Several students even used both the inversing and formal strategies (performing the same operation on both sides) for the same equation. When the unknown x appeared as the subtrahend or the divisor, the success rate dropped dramatically, and students tried to use the formal solving method of performing the same operation on both sides to solve such equations. The findings of this study not only suggest how teachers can be sensitive to students’ different interpretations of unknowns, but also highlight the importance of using students’ prior sense making to teach equation solving and of helping students gain an in-depth understanding of equation solving and representations of unknowns.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Most research has focused solely on understanding high school or college students’ mathematical creative thinking abilities while understanding younger students’ creative thinking in mathematics was ignored. These studies of older students have focused mainly on students’ creative products rather than creative processes. The authors of the present study investigated four young elementary school students’ creative processes through eye-tracking (ET) and stimulated recall interview (SRI) techniques while they engaged in multiple representations (MRs) of mathematical problems. Our qualitative case study revealed what phases four elementary school students’ creative processes in MRs involve and how they achieve original ideas. The results revealed that neither Wallas’ (1926) creative process of mathematicians nor  Schindler and Lilienthal’s (2020) creative process of a high school student could fully explain the creative processes of four young elementary school students in the present study. The findings from the present study emphasize that four young students’ creative processes are difficult to predict as it is non-linear compared to professional mathematicians’ creative process, but young students’ creative processes can be demystified through ET and SRI techniques. The present study also emphasizes the importance of external factors (e.g., teachers, peers, environment) for the four elementary school students to get different perspectives to achieve creative ideas in mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>One typical challenge in algebra education is that many students justify the equivalence of expressions only by referring to transformation rules that they perceive as arbitrary without being able to justify these rules. A good algebraic understanding involves connecting the transformation rules to other characterizations of equivalence of expressions (e.g., description equivalence that both expressions describe the same situation or figure). In order to overcome this disconnection even before variables are introduced, a design research study was conducted in Grade 5 to design and investigate an early algebra learning environment to establish stronger connections between different mental models and representations of equivalence of expressions. The qualitative analysis of design experiments with 14 fifth graders revealed deep insights into complexities of connecting representations. It confirmed that many students first relate the representations in ways that are too superficial without establishing deep connections. Analyzing successful students’ processes helped to identify an additional characterization that can support students in bridging the connection between other characterizations, which we call restructuring equivalence. By including learning opportunities for restructuring equivalence, students can be supported to compare expressions in graphical and symbolic representation simultaneously and dynamically. The design research study disentangles the complex requirements for realizing the design principle of connecting multiple representations, which should be of relevance beyond the specific concept of equivalence and applicable to other mathematical topics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Inquiry-Based learning (IBL) is a fairly well-known term in the United States (US) describing a range of student-centered or active pedagogical approaches in mathematics. However, the ‘big tent’ definitions of IBL mean that there is much variation in IBL users’ instructional practices, variation which we set out to codify. Cluster analysis of self-reported data from a survey of postsecondary calculus instructors across the US reveals three instructional profiles among self-declared users of IBL: (a) heavy users of group work; (b) users of a variety of mixed approaches; and (c) heavy users of didactic lecture. The instructional profile of this third group is indistinguishable from that of calculus instructors who report never having heard of IBL. We further investigate the relationship of these instructional profiles to certain beliefs about teaching and learning. All groups agree that inquiry supports learning; the groups who spend a minority of time in didactic lecture disagree with statements that there are benefits to lecturing. Implications for research and adoption of IBL are discussed.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: The Indonesian government has evaluated the research performance of universities, whose measurement process is projected into resources, management, outputs, and revenues to determine the provision of incentives, grants, and program funding to universities. However, efficiency calculations have shown that the outputs and competition-based incentives that drive scientific productivity are more complex. The most competitive systems must also be the most productive when considering resources. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the research efficiency in the Indonesian higher education system. Research Designs: The efficiency was analyzed by maximizing the 13 product outputs from the research budget and university staff. The result was then compared with the existing performance measurement analysis. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to evaluate the efficiency based on the data of 47 universities in the Mandiri cluster and 144 in the Utama cluster for the 2014–2018 period. Results: These findings showed that about 68% of universities have an efficiency value of 1 for the Mandiri group, almost 40% in the Utama group, and 41% for the two groups combined. Additionally, this study compared the efficiency analysis and the impact of the performance evaluation. Conclusions: The comparison showed that adding efficiency or productivity factors in the performance evaluation assessment produced a more accurate result.
