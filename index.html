  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 999-1020, December 2021. <br>We present a new command, radf, that tests for explosive behavior in time series. The command computes the right-tail augmented Dickey and Fuller (1979, Journal of the American Statistical Association 74: 427–431) unitroot test and its further developments based on supremum statistics derived from augmented Dickey–Fuller-type regressions estimated using recursive windows (Phillips, Wu, and Yu, 2011, International Economic Review 52: 201–226) and recursive flexible windows (Phillips, Shi, and Yu, 2015, International Economic Review 56: 1043–1078). It allows for the lag length in the test regression and the width of rolling windows to be either specified by the user or determined using data-dependent procedures, and it performs the date-stamping procedures advocated by Phillips, Wu, and Yu (2011) and Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015) to identify episodes of explosive behavior. It also implements the wild bootstrap proposed by Phillips and Shi (2020, Handbook of Statistics: Financial, Macro and Micro Econometrics Using R, Vol. 42, 61–80) to lessen the potential effects of unconditional heteroskedasticity and account for the multiplicity issue in recursive testing. The use of radf is illustrated with an empirical example.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 853-884, December 2021. <br>Many studies estimate the impact of exposure to some quasiexperimental policy or event using a panel event study design. These models, as a generalized extension of “difference-in-differences” designs or two-way fixed-effects models, allow for dynamic leads and lags to the event of interest to be estimated, while also controlling for fixed factors (often) by area and time. In this article, we discuss the setup of the panel event study design in a range of situations and lay out several practical considerations for its estimation. We describe a command, eventdd, that allows for simple estimation, inference, and visualization of event study models in a range of circumstances. We then provide several examples to illustrate eventdd’s use and flexibility, as well as its interaction with various native Stata commands, and other relevant community-contributed commands such as reghdfe and boottest.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 1021-1027, December 2021. <br>Researchers and psychometricians have long used Cronbach’s α as a measure of reliability. However, there have been growing calls to replace Cronbach’s α with measures that have more defensible assumptions. One of the most common and straightforward recommended reliability estimates is ω. After a review of reliability and its estimation in Stata, I introduce the community-contributed command omegacoef. This command reports McDonald’s ω in a format similar to the base alpha command. omegacoef provides Stata users the ability to easily compute estimates of reliability with the confidence that the necessary statistical assumptions are met.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 1028-1033, December 2021. <br>The Schoenfeld residual-based test for proportional-hazards violations in the Cox duration model is predicated on a key assumption pertaining to homoskedasticity in the residuals. This assumption is likely to be violated in the presence of stratified hazards, which is noted in estat phtest’s help file. We provide a wrapper command, stratph, that implements a straightforward modification to the residual-based diagnostic that corrects for the potential assumption violation. We use the stratified hazards example from the stcox help file to demonstrate the stratph command’s workings.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 885-951, December 2021. <br>In this article, I discuss the method of relative distribution analysis and present Stata software implementing various elements of the methodology. The relative distribution is the distribution of the relative ranks that the outcomes from one distribution take on in another distribution. The methodology can be used, for example, to compare the distribution of wages between men and women. The presented software, reldist, estimates the relative cumulative distribution and the relative density, as well as the relative polarization, divergence, and other summary measures of the relative ranks. It also provides functionality such as location and shape decompositions or covariate balancing. Statistical inference is implemented in terms of influence functions and supports estimation for complex samples.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 972-998, December 2021. <br>In this article, we present commands to enable fixing the value of the correlation between the unobservables in Heckman models. These commands can solve two practical issues. First, for situations in which a valid exclusion restriction is not available, these commands enable exploring how the results could be affected by sample-selection bias. Second, stepping through values of this correlation can verify whether the global maximum of the likelihood function has been found. We provide several commands to fit these and related models with a fixed value of the correlation between the unobservables.

The command allows the user to model selection in quantile regressions by using either a Gaussian or a one-dimensional Frank copula. We illustrate the use of qregsel with two examples. First, we apply the method to the fictional dataset used in the Stata Base Reference Manual for the heckman command. Second, we replicate part of the empirical application of the original article using data for the United Kingdom that cover the period 1978–2000 to compare wages of males and females at different quantiles.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 1047-1064, December 2021. <br>This column is a tutorial discussing looping in parallel using foreach and forvalues. Such looping may use not only local macros defined for the purpose but also other devices, including the gettoken command and ways to increment and decrement other macros and to evaluate other expressions.The main idea is that a set of loops in parallel is essentially one loop with two or more sets of parallel actions. Examples cover looping over integers with a required specific display format, generating new variables and defining variable labels at the same time, binning variables as desired, and putting skewness results in new variables. The last example includes some historical comments on the tangled literature on skewness measures using medians and quantiles.

  Abstract
                  <p>As a Canadian mathematics educator, I have a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters. After all, to me, Canadian mathematics education matters. It should come as no surprise then that I have followed the most recent debate over the teaching and learning of mathematics here in Canada for the past decade. The problem, at least for me, is that the debate is now stale. More and more results, results that are meant to measure the math skills of young Canadians, are reported and I already know what will happen, how things will play out in the media, who will say what, blah, blah, blah. To be honest, I do not even bother weighing in on the matter any more. In fact, I was just about to put what has become known as the Canadian Math Wars behind me for good, but then I stumbled onto a file folder while upgrading my computer. There, sitting in a file, was the information I needed to once again rekindle my interest. In what follows, I detail my efforts to establish the grade level equivalent for the math skills displayed by inebriated, adult Canadians. Having now scratched that itch, I am ready to move on and start looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters. Stay tuned.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundCorruption affects businesses in various ways. Anti-corruption, on the other hand, can improve the institutions of the country as well as business operations. Vietnam, as a socialist-oriented country with an ongoing high-profile anti-corruption campaign, provides us a unique setting to evaluate the impacts of anti-corruption on corporate performance.ObjectivesWe address two questions: (1) what is the effect of anti-corruption on the performance of private-owned firms in Vietnam? and (2) how does anti-corruption influence the performance of firms with state ownership (FSOs) in Vietnam?Research designTo investigate the impact of anti-corruption on performance of firms with different ownership settings, we use the establishment of the Central Anti-Corruption Steering Committee of Vietnam as a quasi-natural experiment for difference-in-differences analysis. We generate treatment effects of private holding and the state block ownership. To validate the findings, we construct a novel news-based anti-corruption index from Vietnamese online newspapers and use it in a robustness test to evaluate anti-corruption’s impacts on firm performance.Results and ConclusionsWe find a positive impact of the anti-corruption campaign on private firms’ performance, supporting the social norm perspective of how corruption affects businesses. The empirical results indicate a negative impact of the campaign on FSOs’ performance. The findings suggest that anti-corruption benefits private firms via improving the institutional quality of the country while improving the financial transparency of FSOs. Our study provides a method for measuring anti-corruption which is virtually unobservable and absent in the literature. The findings have implications for policymaking in contemporary Vietnam.

  Abstract
                  <p>Problem posing has received increased attention among researchers and educators. One of the most important aspects is to understand the cognitive process of problem posing. In this study, we conceptualized a framework for the cognitive process of mathematical problem posing in three stages: (a) input—understanding the task, (b) processing—constructing the problem, and (c) output—expressing the problem. In this paper we focus on examining the role of task format (i.e., the presence or absence of specific numerical information, with or without context) in 669 students’ problem posing and behaviors during the three stages of problem posing and problem solving. The major findings were that students’ performance was better when the task contained specific numerical information (i.e., the task with context) than when it did not (the task without context) during the problem-posing stages of understanding tasks and constructing problems. Students’ behaviors during the stage of expressing problems did not show a significant difference under the task format with (or without) numbers, but students could express problems more clearly under the task format with context than under the task format without context. Moreover, students who were able to solve the problem correctly were able to pose more mathematical problems and more solvable problems than those who couldn’t solve the problem. In particular, students who were able to solve the problem correctly had a better understanding of the problem-posing task. However, students who were unable to solve the problem correctly were still able to pose solvable and complex problems.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Visuospatial representations of numbers and their relationships are widely used in mathematics education. These include drawn images, models constructed with concrete manipulatives, enactive/embodied forms, computer graphics, and more. This paper addresses the analytical limitations and ethical implications of methodologies that use broad categorizations of representations and argues the benefits of dynamic qualitative analysis of arithmetical-representational strategy across multiple semi-independent aspects of display, calculation, and interaction. It proposes an alternative methodological approach combining the structured organization of classification with the detailed nuance of description and describes a systematic but flexible framework for analysing nonstandard visuospatial representations of early arithmetic. This approach is intended for use by researchers or practitioners, for interpretation of multimodal and nonstandard visuospatial representations, and for identification of small differences in learners’ developing arithmetical-representational strategies, including changes over time. Application is illustrated using selected data from a microanalytic study of struggling students’ multiplication and division in scenario tasks.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundThe regression point displacement (RPD) design is a quasi-experiment (QE) that aims to control many threats to internal validity. Though it has existed for several decades, RPD has only recently begun to answer applied research questions in lieu of stronger QEs.ObjectivesOur primary objective was to implement within-study comparison (WSC) logic to create RPD replicates and to determine conditions under which RPD might provide estimates comparable to those found in validating experiments.Research DesignWe utilize three randomized controlled trials (two cluster-level, one individual-level), artificially decomposing or creating cluster structures, to create multiple RPDs. We compare results in each RPD treatment group to a fixed set of control groups to gauge the congruence of these repeated RPD realizations with results found in these three RCTs.ResultsRPD’s performance was uneven. Using multiple criteria, we found that RPDs successfully predicted the direction of the RCT’s intervention effect but inconsistently fell within the .10 SD threshold. A scant 13% of RPD results were statistically significant at either the .05 or .01 alpha-level. RPD results were within the 95% confidence interval of RCTs around half the time, and false negative rates were substantially higher than false positive rates.ConclusionsRPD consistently underestimates treatment effects in validating RCTs. We analyze reasons for this insensitivity and offer practical suggestions to improve the chances RPD will correctly identify favorable results. We note that the synthetic, “decomposition of cluster RCTs,” WSC design represents a prototype for evaluating other QEs.
