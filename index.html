          Abstract
                  <p>In a study of student understanding of negative definite integrals at two institutions, we administered a written survey and follow-up clinical interviews at one institution and found that “backward integrals”, where the integral was taken from right to left on the x-axis, were the most difficult for students to interpret. We then conducted additional interviews focused on backward integrals at a second institution. Our analysis uses the concept image framework and a recent categorical framework for mathematical sense making. We found that students were most successful using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to determine the sign of an integral when a symbolic expression was provided. When considering a definite integral in a graphical context, students often had difficulty if they viewed the integral as a spatial area, stating that area must always be positive. Some students were able to conceptualize 
                    
                    \(\Delta x\)
                    
                   or 
                    
                    \(dx\)
                    
                   as a difference or change and thus a signed quantity; when these students were able to view the area as a sum of smaller pieces, they were more successful in justifying a negative backward integral. Students who used amounts or similar images often had difficulty making sense of the negative sign. Even more progress was made when students either invoked or were asked explicitly about a specific physical context to be represented by the backward integral, other than spatial area. The context provided a meaning to the difference represented by 
                    
                    \(\Delta x\)
                    
                   or 
                    
                    \(dx\)
                    
                   and thus to the sign of that difference and the definite integral.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>This qualitative survey study set out to investigate in-service and pre-service primary school teachers’ perceived barriers to and enablers for the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning in an Australian educational context. While research over the past three decades have documented pedagogical benefits of teaching mathematics using children’s literature, research into teachers’ perceptions regarding the use of such resources is virtually non-existent. The study thus filled this research gap by drawing responses from open-ended survey questions of 94 in-service and 82 pre-service teachers in Australia. A thematic analysis revealed 13 perceived barriers classified under five themes with Lack of Pedagogical Knowledge and Confidence, and Time Constraint, representing 75% of all perceived barriers. Moreover, 14 perceived enablers were identified and classified under five themes with Pedagogical Benefits and Love of Stories representing around 70% of all perceived enablers. Findings also showed that most of the teachers in the study (around 75%) never or infrequently used children’s literature in their mathematics classrooms. The study highlights the role of professional learning and teacher training in ensuring that both in- and pre-service teachers have the necessary pedagogical knowledge, experience and confidence in using children’s literature to enrich their mathematics teaching.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>This study focuses on a lesson study adaptation for bridging prospective teachers’ experiences in a methods course and their field experiences in a teacher education program in Puerto Rico. We ask, what opportunities for teacher learning emerge during discussions in lesson study? Two lesson study teams of secondary mathematics prospective teachers, each led by an experienced mentor, planned technology-based lessons. Using the theoretical framework for lesson study by Lewis and colleagues, we analyzed video recordings of the teams’ discussions. The results show learning opportunities in the three dimensions of the framework: teachers’ knowledge and beliefs, the creation of a professional community, and the development of teaching–learning artifacts. The mentors leveraged prospective teachers’ knowledge, built on topics discussed in the methods course, and created a professional learning community. Three resources introduced in the methods course supported the creation of a hybrid space connecting academic and practitioner knowledge: shared language about teaching moves for using technology in math instruction, the mathematical proficiency framework, and a lesson plan template. The mentors drew upon their subject matter and pedagogical knowledge during their facilitation of lesson study. The intervention exemplifies a lesson study adaptation that is feasible in the context of a teacher education program.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, I examine deficit talk, utterances that depict students and/or families based on their perceived deficits, in an equity-oriented professional development (PD) setting. Researchers often attribute deficit talk by mathematics teachers (MTs) to their biased beliefs and perceptions. From an interactional approach, namely conversation analysis and discursive psychology, I offer an alternative perspective on how deficit talk is produced in PD interactions. The analysis shows the rhetorical functions of deficit talk, which are designed for MTs to manage their accountability with a range of potential issues and to portray themselves as competent teachers. The analysis also reveals the action-performing nature of deficit talk (e.g., refusing a request) situated in the social interaction. To conclude, this paper suggests that mathematics teacher educators need to attend to the micropolitical nature of deficit talk and their co-participation in the production of deficit talk as they formulate ways to respond to deficit talk in PD interactions.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics teaching in a 21st-century educational context requires a shift to active learning. The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers’ self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers’ self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers’ report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher’s professional development.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers currently gain increasing attention, as their practices are crucial for the success of spreading mathematics educational ideas and innovations into schools and strengthening the professional expertise of teachers. So far, mainly two components of facilitation have been empirically researched: facilitators’ knowledge resources and facilitation moves. In this paper, we propose to develop a more comprehensive conceptual framework in order to explain facilitators’ practices and underlying decisions. For this purpose, we lift Schoenfeld’s ROG framework for teachers' decision-making (comprising resources, orientations, and goals) to the facilitator level, and add identity as a fourth component to obtain what we call the ROGI framework. We draw on data collected simultaneously in two PD projects for mathematics teachers in Germany and in Israel. Through three cases of facilitation, we illustrate how the adapted ROGI framework helps to understand processes of decision-making made by facilitators during mathematics professional development sessions.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>There has been a surge in the number of Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs), which are degree-granting, nonprofit, postsecondary institutions that enroll at least 25% Hispanic/Latinx/e undergraduate students. Although HSI scholarship has increased dramatically since around 2010, there is still a gap in knowledge about individuals who fall within the “H” and the diversity among HSIs themselves. Using critical theory and critical methods, the articles in this special topic collection explore the complexities of the Hispanic/Latinx/e identity and the various ways that HSIs fall short of and meet the challenges of serving students at the intersections of identity. This introduction provides a brief overview of the eight articles in this collection and explains the need for this critical approach to HSI scholarship, which we call “intersectional servingness.” We outline the contributions of these eight articles and call on practitioners, scholars, policy intermediaries, funders, and federal agencies to consider the complexities of the “H” while making decisions, advancing research, implementing policies, and creating funding streams that will enhance intersectional servingness.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Prior research suggests that families prefer schools with higher test scores, shorter distances from home, and certain student demographics. We build on this using data from New Orleans, a context well suited to identification of parent preferences because of its deferred acceptance algorithm and extensive, standardized, and broadly accessible school information. This allows us to study revealed preferences for a richer set of characteristics. We find that families prefer schools with higher school value-added, more extracurricular activities, and after-school childcare. We also find heterogeneity by family income that is more consistent with income constraints than preference heterogeneity. Finally, we show how methodology and data shape the results.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Reclassification is a crucial outcome for English learner (EL) students’ academic progress. Though ELs spend a large portion of their academic time with general education teachers, we know little about the role general education teachers play in developing ELs’ English language proficiency. Drawing from a longitudinal administrative dataset from Tennessee, this study uses discrete-time survival analysis to estimate the relationship between ELs’ likelihood of reclassification and characteristics of their general education English language arts (ELA) teachers in Grades 3–8. The study finds that several measures of teacher effectiveness consistently predict EL reclassification. Sensitivity and robustness checks substantiate these relationships. Findings have important policy implications for the identification and assignment of ELs to effective general education ELA teachers.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines the influence of varying levels of online enrollment on community college students’ likelihood of degree completion, with a particular focus on completion outcomes among traditionally underserved subgroups of students. Using institutional transcript data from a high-enrollment community college and a propensity score weighting approach, I find that lower levels of online enrollment have a positive relationship with the likelihood of degree completion for Black, Hispanic, and low-income community college students, but enrolling in all online courses has a negative influence on the likelihood of degree completion across subgroups of community college students.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study examined the extent to which boys fell into clusters comprised of different levels of motivations and costs. In turn, the antecedents of these clusters and associations with engagement and wellbeing outcomes were considered. Based on survey responses from 168 students across Years 5, 7 and 9 from an all-boys' school in Sydney, Australia, three clusters were identified: Positively Engaged, Disengaged, and Struggling Ambitious. Performance-approach and avoidance achievement goals, mastery classroom goal structure, perceived peer valuing of mathematics and teacher enthusiasm differentially predicted profile membership. Clusters were also found to differ in terms of both wellbeing and engagement, such that students within maladaptive profiles evidenced the most negative outcomes. The study reaffirms prior work, holds implications for addressing student motivation in mathematics, and adds to understanding of the interplay of individual and classroom goal structures in relation to students’ mathematics expectancies, values and resultant outcomes.</p>

                  <p>Emotions and motivation are important for learning and achievement in mathematics. In this paper, we present an overview of research on students’ emotions and motivation in mathematics. First, we briefly review how early research has developed into the current state-of-the-art and outline the following key characteristics of emotions and motivation: objects, valence, temporal stability (vs. variability), and situational specificity (vs. generality). Second, we summarize major theories in the field (the control-value theory of achievement emotions, expectancy-value theory of achievement-related motivation, self-determination theory of human motivation, and social-cognitive theory of self-efficacy). Third, we present an overview of instructional characteristics that have been shown to foster emotions and motivation. Fourth, we provide an overview of the contributions to the special issue on “Emotions and Motivation in Mathematics Education and Educational Psychology.” Finally, we suggest directions for future research in the field with respect to advancing theory, improving measurement, and considering diversity and inclusion.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>I report the results of an analysis of an episode of elementary school second language mathematics classroom talk focused on the classification of geometric forms, drawing on a dialogic, sources of meaning perspective. The episode was selected 
      because participants make use of a variety of features of language, including vocabulary, gestures and diagrams. The analysis drew on methods and principles from conversation analysis and revealed that interactional repair was a key feature in the organisation of the episode. Repair sequences are stretches of interaction in which participants deal with explicitly signalled ‘trouble’ in participants’ working assumption of shared understanding. The results include a distinction between meaning-focused and language-focused repair, with some repair sequences embedded within others. This layered organisation is important in the emergence of meaning for participants’ utterances and mediates the tension between centripetal and centrifugal language forces. The findings highlight the complexity of mathematics classroom interaction and suggest possibilities for the careful management of focusing on language and on mathematical meaning in classroom interaction.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>Since statistical inference is a probabilistic generalization about a population analyzed on the basis of a sample, inferential reasoning demands producing reasons (statistical and contextual) to substantiate and validate generalizations. To convey an understanding of students’ inferential reasoning, we present a proposal—based on Toulmin’s argumentation model—in which the production of statistical and contextual reasons serve as fundamental components of students’ inferential reasoning by providing supporting arguments that can be expressed as a sequence of statements. We analyze the inferential reasoning of university students asked to work in teams on an inferential activity in the context of environmental pollution. Results show that they integrated informal and formal methods to produce statistical reasons, complemented by contextual reasons to support their conclusions. Their reasoning model allowed us to identify (a) a potential transition from informal to formal inferential reasoning; and (b) ambiguity, or an absence of expressions of uncertainty, about generalizations regarding the population, possibly related to their confidence in using formal methods (e.g., hypothesis testing). We conclude that our proposal helps encourage and analyze students’ inferential reasoning. Future research will require clearer definitions of the characteristics of the argumentation model in the field of statistical inferential reasoning because arguments depend on their disciplinary context.</p>

                  <p>The integration of coding in K-12 mathematics education is occurring throughout jurisdictions around the world. Best practices for applying coding practices in teaching mathematics are gaining research attention, and teacher education programmes are increasingly offering professional development to support this initiative. This paper discusses strategies and lessons learned over a 5-year period of developing and offering mandatory coding education as part of mathematics teacher preparation. We identify some of the requisite knowledge and experiences needed in order to overcome coding anxiety and begin to adopt coding as part of mathematics teaching practice. In particular, we discuss a distinction between learning coding through mathematics and learning mathematics through coding.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>When it comes to content courses for prospective secondary teachers, mathematics faculty’s intentions conflict with teachers’ experiences: while faculty aim to influence teachers’ future teaching, many teachers find these courses irrelevant to teaching. In this study, we investigate mathematics faculty’s goals for content courses for prospective secondary teachers and how these goals connect to their vision of secondary teaching. This study makes two contributions. First, drawing on data from an interview study (n = 5) of faculty who have taught secondary teachers, we articulate these mathematicians’ rationales with respect to teaching secondary teachers, particularly in capstone courses. Second, we contribute a conceptual framework that supports inferences about connections between content course activities and instructors’ beliefs about secondary teaching. We conclude by suggesting that the dual triad that depicts our framework may support professional development and programmatic design.</p>
