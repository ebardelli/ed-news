  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite an increase in special education enrollment, a stark gap in high school completion between students with and without disabilities persists. This study examined the impact of Unified Champion Schools (UCS), a Special Olympics program designed to foster social inclusion through three components—Unified Sports, Inclusive Youth Leadership, and Whole School Engagement—on high school graduation rates. Using a novel dataset and a difference-in-differences design, we found that implementing the UCS program increased the graduation rate by 1.1 percentage points for all students and 1.4 percentage points for students with disabilities. The increase in schooling outcomes for students with disabilities in UCS schools also was found to be positively correlated with perceptions about a more socially inclusive school environment.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this article is to explore the authors’ and the co-authors’ reflexivity in feminist participatory action research, conducted in three kindergartens in Indonesia, aiming to disrupt traditional gender discourses in early childhood education settings. Kindergarten is one of the most gendered spaces that perpetuate the binary between femininities and masculinities. This research takes place in Indonesia, one of the most populous Muslim countries in the world. The first part of the study deals with our own reflexivity as university lecturers, middle class and Muslim women, and we use these as a departure point to understand multiple positioning taken by our nine co-researchers as kindergarten teachers, women as well as Muslims and how these influence their gender understanding. The second part of the study discusses the journey of our co-researchers from having gender blind to more gender flexible attitude. As the co-researchers began to acknowledge their personal values, they were better able to apply gender flexible pedagogies to their kindergarten context. The co-researchers also demonstrate different forms of action in implementing gender flexible pedagogy. Our study suggests continuous reflexivity and the possibility of translating gender flexible pedagogy into the co-researchers’ local context were essential factors in this action research.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Civil courage refers to the behavior where people actively intervene to protect a victim in a concrete situation of injustice despite the risk of becoming a victim themselves. To act with civil courage, one requires competencies that relate to prosocial values as well as the physical and social ability to act. In this context, this brief reports the opinions of 2,046 respondents—representatives of Germany with respect to age, gender, and region—on what, according to them, are the best contexts for learning civil courage. “At home and/or from family” as well as “through volunteering” are considered the most suitable contexts to learn civil courage. In contrast, television, social media, and the internet are considered the least supportive contexts.

  Abstract
                  <p>Previous research in mathematics education has explored teachers’ conceptions of mathematics and its teaching and learning, and how their instructional tendencies (e.g., “traditional”, “technological”, “spontaneous” and “investigative”) relate to these conceptions. However, empirical evidence on this topic from large samples of pre-service teachers is limited. This study adapts and validates an instrument originally designed for in-service teachers to analyse the conceptions of mathematics and mathematics teaching and learning. This was done in a sample of undergraduate students in several different degree programmes (primary education, mathematics, and the education itinerary in psychology) in a Spanish university. Existing theory about instructional tendencies and conceptions of mathematics teaching and learning that was developed in the context of in-service teachers is then re-examined in the context of empirical evidence from this sample of individuals (all potential future teachers) without teaching experience. Results show that items from the instrument can be separated into four factors focussed on investigative stances, the role of textbooks, the role of teachers and lesson planning. Individual participants are not characterised by single tendencies; rather, they can be described in terms of several combinations of tendencies, grouped into four clusters. In line with the previous literature on in-service teachers, results suggest that conceptions of mathematics and its teaching and learning are not best captured by rigid, sharply delineated profiles. Rather, individuals configure their own conceptions in terms of combinations of different characteristics of prototypical tendencies.</p>

However, little is known about teachers’ understanding of mathematical reasoning or the practices they use to foster its development in the classroom—both in Quebec and elsewhere. In this article, we analyze the discourse of teachers in order to examine how they conceptualize mathematical reasoning and what practices they believe are critical for its development. The Mathematical Discourse for Teaching framework (Cooper 2015) helps to characterize these practices. Results from our study pinpoint key words, shared and hoped-for routines, narratives that are generally endorsed by the community as well as commognitive conflicts. Specifically, mathematical reasoning is associated either with a competency to be assessed or, more broadly, with a process of understanding. These two manners of conceptualizing mathematical reasoning lead to different routines, but also to a tension between the desire to help students make sense of mathematics and the requirement to test competency based on a specific rubric. These findings appear to be linked to the fact that the Mathematical Discourse for Teaching (MDT) of primary teachers is based on multiple discourses that do not necessarily share the same founding principles or metadiscursive rules, which leads to inherent commognitive conflicts for teachers in this community.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For teachers of immigrant-origin students and their peers, emerging research notes the challenge of facilitating a high-quality education for students subject to traumatic events related to harsh immigration enforcement policies. This study examines whether new teachers from seven teacher preparation programs experienced the impacts of immigration enforcement and felt prepared to support students who were impacted. I surveyed new teachers in preservice and after 1 year of teaching (N = 473) using survey instruments developed by Cohen and colleagues along with additional constructs developed via pilot testing. New teachers reported that immigration enforcement negatively impacted their students and their job satisfaction. Teachers exposed to discussion of immigration policy and teachers who reported engaging with immigrant families in preservice were more likely to view themselves as prepared to support students. I discuss differences for teachers in urban, Title I, and elementary settings.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We examine access to effective teachers for low-income students in 26 geographically dispersed school districts over a 5-year period. We measure teacher effectiveness using a value-added model that accounts for measurement error in prior test scores and peer effects. Differences between the average value added of teachers of high- and low-income students are 0.005 standard deviations in English/language arts and 0.004 standard deviations in math. Differences between teachers of Black, Hispanic, and White students are also small. Rearranging teachers to obtain perfect equity would do little to narrow the sizable student achievement gap between low- and high-income students. We also show that a higher proportion of novice teachers in high-poverty schools contributes negligibly to differences in access to effective teachers.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Classroom observation research plays an important role in policy, practice, and scholarship for students with disabilities. When interpreting results of observation studies, it is important to consider the validity evidence provided by researchers and how that speaks to the intended use of those results. In this literature synthesis, we used Kane’s argument-based approach to validity to describe evidence of validity for uses of observation instruments in classroom observation research regarding teachers of students with disabilities. We identified 102 studies from 1975 to 2020 that met inclusion criteria. Results indicated many studies did not report validity evidence to support their use of the observation instruments. Over time, reporting levels for much of the evidence has remained relatively constant, but we noted a consistent decrease in number of observations conducted per teacher and a consistent and large increase in reporting of teacher participant characteristics. We provide implications of this for research and practice and suggestions for improving classroom observation research.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Nationally, educators suspend Black students at greater rates than any other group. This disproportionality is fueled by stereotypes casting Black students as “troublemakers”—a label students too often internalize as part of their identities. Across two independent double-blind randomized field trials involving over 2,000 seventh graders in 11 middle schools, we tested the efficacy of a brief intervention to buffer students from stereotypes and mitigate the racial suspension gap. The self-affirmation intervention helps students access positive aspects of their identities less associated with troublemaking in school. Confirmed in both trials, treatment effects cut Black-White suspension and office disciplinary referral gaps during seventh and eighth grade by approximately two thirds, with even greater impacts for Black students with prior infractions.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>As parents are increasingly given flexibility to enroll their children in a school of their choice, understanding parents’ preferences for school qualities is essential. Using a randomized survey experiment, this study adds to the existing literature by assessing parents’ preferences in a controlled environment, where they can be isolated from information asymmetries and constraints. Results suggest that achievement matters to parents but status matters more when evaluating quality and growth matters more when choosing between schools. Additionally, student demographics affect both parents’ perception of school quality and their likelihood of selecting into a school. This article has important implications for the theory and practice of accountability as it offers new insights on parents’ latent preferences for school qualities.

  Abstract
                  <p>The literature highlights differing views on the efficacy of modelling lessons for teacher professional learning. In this study we draw on dissonance theory to discuss lesson modelling that seeks to transcend ‘do as I do’ imitation and provoke teachers’ attention to intended teaching practices: a necessary pre-cursor for changes to practice. A collective case study investigated the experiences and perceptions of 18 practising primary teachers from four school contexts participating in the process of: collectively observing modelling of mathematics lessons in their classrooms, analysing different parts of those practices with the modeller, and enacting them. It was found that modelling lessons associated with inquiry-oriented approaches for developing students’ problem-solving and reasoning in teachers’ own classrooms appeared to confront their assumptions about traditional approaches to teaching and learning mathematics. The teachers’ surprise at their students’ engagement in the challenging learning experiences conflicted with their existing views of teaching and impelled them to reflect on and set goals for improving their practice. Suggestions for pre- and post-lesson protocols for stimulating productive discussions are proposed, along with implications for designing school-based professional learning processes using lesson modelling.</p>

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to call for research on sexual identity in mathematics education. I first define key terms and their relationships. Next, I discuss how students’ sexual identity relates to school experiences and outcomes. I then summarize existing research on sexual identity and STEM/mathematics education. Finally, I recommend research on sexual identity and mathematics education that can advance our field in a continued commitment to equitable mathematics teaching and learning.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues are urgent in education. We developed and evaluated a massive open online course (N = 963) with embedded equity simulations that attempted to equip educators with equity teaching practices. Applying a structural topic model (STM)—a type of natural language processing (NLP)—we examined how participants with different equity attitudes responded in simulations. Over a sequence of four simulations, the simulation behavior of participants with less equitable beliefs converged to be more similar with the simulated behavior of participants with more equitable beliefs (ES [effect size] = 1.08 SD). This finding was corroborated by overall changes in equity mindsets (ES = 0.88 SD) and changed in self-reported equity-promoting practices (ES = 0.32 SD). Digital simulations when combined with NLP offer a compelling approach to both teaching about DEI topics and formatively assessing learner behavior in large-scale learning environments.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This study examines disruptions to postsecondary education plans in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using nationally representative data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey from August 2020 through March 2021, we investigate the prevalence, forms, reasons, and disparities of education disruption across different sociodemographic groups. While nearly three in four households report education plan disruption, the forms and reasons are drastically different. Black and Latinx respondents are more likely to report plan cancellation, while Whites are more likely to report taking classes in different formats. Non-White groups are more likely to cancel plans due to health or financial concerns, while Whites are more likely to cancel plans due to concerns about changes to campus life. Results also reveal nuanced intersections of race, type of education plans, and household vulnerability in affecting education disruption, pointing to the necessity of well-targeted initiatives to address long-term consequences and resulting inequality.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we analyse a large, opportunistic dataset of responses (N = 219,826) to online, diagnostic multiple-choice mathematics questions, provided by 6–16-year-old UK school mathematics students (N = 7302). For each response, students were invited to indicate on a 5-point Likert-type scale how confident they were that their response was correct. Using demographic data available from the online platform, we examine the relationships between confidence and facility (the proportion of questions correct), as well as gender, age and socioeconomic disadvantage. We found a positive correlation between student confidence and mean facility, higher confidence for boys than for girls and lower confidence for students classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged, even after accounting for facility. We found that confidence was lower for older students, and this was particularly marked across the primary to secondary school transition. An important feature of the online platform used is that, when students answer a question incorrectly, they are presented with an analogous question about 3 weeks later. We exploited this feature to obtain the first evidence in an authentic school mathematics context for the hypercorrection effect (Butterfield &amp; Metcalfe J EXP PSYCHOL 27:1491–1494, 2001), which is the observation that errors made with higher confidence are more likely to be corrected. These findings have implications for classroom practices that have the potential to support more effective and efficient learning of mathematics.</p>

Several actions reimagine the work of mathematics as building blocks for engaging the flourishing for Black communities: (1) expanding and amplifying direct networks for Black parents to share, communicate, and advocate for their own needs and spaces around mathematics; (2) making visible and amplifying our advocacy for racial justice in the content creation and representation found in current digital platforms for meeting the needs of Black communities; and the need to (3) invest in, prioritize usage of, and illuminate mathematics commercial and academic entities focused solely on creating content and centering Black (and other people’s) knowledge and experiences in mathematics for Black families.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Visual representations, such as diagrams, are known to be valuable tools in problem solving and proof construction. However, previous studies have shown that simply having access to a diagram is not sufficient to improve students’ performance on mathematical tasks. Rather, students must actively extract information about the problem scenario from their diagrams for them to be useful. Furthermore, several studies have described the behaviors of mathematicians and students when solving problems and writing proofs, but few have discussed students’ behaviors in the context of proof writing in introductory point-set topology. We present a case study of an undergraduate, Stacey, enrolled in a general topology course. Throughout a semester, we presented Stacey with several proof-related tasks and examined how and why Stacey used diagrams when working on these tasks. Based on our analysis, we concluded that Stacey’s diagram creation and subsequent use during the construction of a given proof was an effort to identify the key idea of the proof. We describe Stacey’s overall proving behaviors through the lens of a problem-solving framework and present Stacey’s use of diagrams as an aid to discovering the key ideas of proofs in topology.</p>

                  <p>This study aimed to investigate secondary mathematics teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking in the context of a professional development (PD) program utilizing modeling-based teacher investigations. The PD program was conducted with two groups of mathematics teachers from two public high schools. It included seven 1-month-long cycles, each consisting of an introductory meeting, the teachers’ classroom implementations of a model-eliciting activity (MEA), and a follow-up meeting focusing on the teachers’ collaborative investigation and discussion of students’ written work, including their strategies to solve the MEA. Findings suggested that participating in the PD program promoted the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking, albeit differently, over time. We elaborated on the components of the PD program that might have influenced the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking. Implications of the findings on teachers’ noticing for researchers, PD leaders, and teacher educators are discussed in terms of potential directions for future research and practice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper concerns the relationship between research and governance policy in three Swedish major development projects in mathematics education: the New Math project (1960–1975), the PUMP project (1970–1980), and the Boost for Mathematics project in (2012–2016). All three projects were driven or financed by the Swedish central school authorities. Using a historical comparative method, this study deepens the understanding of how research co-exists with governance policy when preparing innovations in mathematics education. The main historical sources are official reports and governmental decisions concerning the three projects. The analysis is focused on the nature of the innovations of each project and the role of researchers in the process of creating the innovations. The analysis highlights the theories and the methods involved in those processes. The three projects are also positioned in a context of school governance policy. In Sweden, the prevailing school governing policy changed from a highly centralised governance in the 1960s to a highly decentralised governance in the 2010s. The paper concludes by discussing to what degree the researchers adhered to principles of research or school governance; in particular, the Boost for Mathematics project is considered in this regard. The relevance of the paper in relation to the emerging field of implementation research in mathematics education concerns how historical studies can give new insights about contemporary development projects in mathematics education.</p>
