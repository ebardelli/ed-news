          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This article provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of DPMs. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.

          Abstract
      
                  <p>The continued underrepresentation of Black students in science education in Ontario has highlighted issues of social justice within the province, and the ways in which this impacts minoritized groups, curriculum design, and teacher education. Critics of a post-colonial education system that reinforces existing biases against certain groups have pointed to culturally relevant and culturally responsive pedagogies for enhanced student success. The lack of attention to Black history, experiences, and perspectives in science has resulted in the needs of Black student populations being underserved. This small-scale qualitative study examines the self-reported pedagogies of three purposefully selected, successful science teachers, effectively utilizing culturally relevant and responsive pedagogies to improve Black student engagement and achievement in Ontario classrooms. Responses from participants recorded via Zoom using in-depth semi-structured interview protocols, along with additional notes taken in informal conversations, were inductively and deductively analysed. Three major themes emerged: successful teachers of Black students practice inclusion by incorporating Black references and experiences in classroom teachings, actively work to build empowering relationships with students and their caregivers, and are life-long learners, motivated and committed to supporting the academic, social, and cultural needs of their students. In addition, our findings suggest that science teachers, regardless of race, can promote Black student success through being critically reflexive practitioners and adopting culturally responsive strategies. As a result, these success stories can inform broader school administration policy regarding diverse student populations, and improve science teacher preparation and education programmes in Ontario and beyond.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>To assess the elements necessary to be a successful learning community (ClinCalc) mentor to medical students from the mentee’s perspective. Few such studies have utilized the in-depth and richness of detail obtained in qualitative studies. This qualitative study analyzed four focus group discussions lasting 45–90 min conducted at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, which has an established LC, in the year 2018. The groups included 14 pre-clerkship and 8 clerkship students. Investigators evaluated transcriptions of the focus group discussions using ATLAS.ti software. Three overarching categories of discussion emerged from the group discussions: (1) Relationship Competence, (2) Teaching Competence, and (3) Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence. Relationship Competence themes included “walk with me,” relationship is most important, and one-on-one. Teaching Competence themes included above and beyond, recognize and address mentor limitations, and safe and enriching environment. Ethical and Compassionate Medical Practice Competence themes included ethical decision making and compassionate care for diverse patient populations. Mentees focused on various aspects of the mentor-mentee relationship as the single most essential competence. Themes mentees discussed as important qualities of a successful mentor may denote qualities to be prioritized in faculty development and mentor recruitment. Future studies could investigate how the LC environment informs former medical students and promotes patient outcomes.

          Abstract
                  <p>We attend to the composition of even and odd functions, as featured in imagined dialogues between a teacher and students, composed by sixteen teachers in a professional development program. Data were analyzed as aimed at addressing students’ intellectual needs, with particular attention to the need for causality and the need for certainty. The results indicate that participants bring into account a myriad of approaches that either complement or replace algebraic definitions of even and odd functions. We provide possible explanations for such a phenomenon in the discussion of the findings.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Professors in proof-based mathematics courses often intend that the feedback they provide on students’ flawed proofs will promote proof comprehension. In this theoretical article, we investigate how such feedback can be formulated. Drawing on Lakatos’s process of proof and refutation, we propose the notion of heuristic refutation feedback for feedback on a flawed proof that contains a mathematical argument, possibly incomplete, that logically implies that the student’s proof is invalid. Such feedback is heuristic in the sense that interpreting and utilizing it invites mathematical reasoning that can contribute to development of proof comprehension. We build on Toulmin’s model of argumentation to analyze possible variations in the formulation of feedback. Based on data from a Real-Analysis course, we highlight two key decisions entailed in formulating refutation feedback: deciding what flawed (possibly implicit) claim in the student’s proof to refute, and deciding how explicitly to present the various elements of the refutation argument. We exemplify these decisions in two particular types of refutation feedback that we have identified: refutation by counter-example and refutation by false implication. We show how different formulations of refutation feedback may afford different opportunities for student-engagement with particular facets of proof comprehension. Our findings suggest how professors can purposefully tailor feedback in order to achieve particular didactic goals.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>There is a growing interest in conducting research in educational mathematics in the area of the didactics of probability, where the main difficulties that students have in understanding the concepts related to statistical inference have been revealed. For this research, the concept of the empirical rule and a practical application created by students was investigated, using a descriptive methodology, from the formulation of a problem to their conclusions. The aim is to learn more about student’s statistical thinking to use an adaptation of Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) generic model and to generate descriptions of how students go through the Problem, Plan, Data, Analysis, Conclusions (PPDAC) cycle based on the classification of thinking into categories proposed by Wild and Pfannkuch. Finally, this study was to investigate a learning environment for statistical reasoning through the Learning Environment for Statistical Reasoning (SRLE) model.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study documents the resources U.S. colleges and universities offer to address student food and housing insecurity and explores differences across community colleges, four-year public schools, and four-year private schools. Using a stratified random sample (n = 448) of U.S. postsecondary institutions, a systematic web search for evidence of 18 resources was conducted. A framework for classifying resources was developed. Logistic regression was used to explore differences by institution type. Eighty-eight percent of the schools in the sample offered at least one resource. On average, schools offered four resources. Food pantries were the most frequently offered resource, while providing information about low-cost campus dining options was the least frequently offered. Four-year private schools offered fewer resources than four-year public schools and community colleges.

          Abstract
                  <p>During the last decades, the study of how learners and teachers of mathematics use the resource of language has contributed to our understanding of mathematics teaching and learning in a variety of classrooms and cultures. Developmental work with mathematics teachers on the particular resource of mathematics teaching talk is more recent. In order to explore responses related to the importance of this talk, in this paper we consider three sites of practice in mathematics education—research, professional development and teaching—and illustrations of data from or about them, including studies from the literature, and work with secondary school mathematics teachers in Catalonia-Spain and Malawi around the teaching of angles. We argue that tensions permeate these sites of practice when a focus is placed on word use, specifically the practices of naming and explaining, in mathematics teaching talk. We conclude that the importance of mathematics teaching talk is construed through tensions with other resources in language and teaching. Tensions specifically appear in the realisation of mathematics teaching talk as mediational in the work with mathematics teachers on their classroom teaching.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>Our study aims to determine how Habermas’ construct of rationality can serve to identify and interpret the difficulties experienced by university students in the mathematical problem-solving process. To this end, a problem which required modelling and solving a differential equation was used. The problem-solving processes of university students were analysed based on rationality components. The findings demonstrated that the problems in epistemic rationality such as predominance of the figure over the definition and/or theorems, use of dogmatic knowledge, intuitive generalizations, lack of prior knowledge, incorrect recognition of the differential equation prevented the choosing and using of an appropriate problem-solving method, leading to problems in teleological rationality. It was determined that the student performance in communicative rationality was negatively affected by problems in epistemic rationality such as using of knowledge acquired by rote and predominance of figure prototype on the definitions and/or theorems. Throughout the analysis, it is required to define two new sub-components, named “geometric” and “algebraic” representation under the modelling requirements of epistemic rationality. It is advised to use the extended version of Habermas’ construct of rationality to examine the performance of students in mathematical activities to get more detailed and accurate results.</p>

                  <p>Makerspaces, Innovation and Science Education: How, Why, and What For? is an attempt to interrogate questions about the history, philosophy, and sociology of science and schooling that have long troubled science educators. In crafting the book, the author, Michael Tan, uses the microcosm of makerspaces to move back and forth to interrogate questions about the nature of knowledge, nature of science, nature of pedagogy, and nature of schooling best suited for the times we live in. In the seven chapters that comprise the book, the author has worked out a consistent framework to answer these questions. This framework represents a strong academic opinion that is thought provoking.</p>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the development, structure, and continuous improvement model of an Action Research education doctorate program research methodology course sequence. The aim of the study is to articulate a rigorous Action Research methodology course sequence and the collaborative faculty process utilized to create and continuously improve upon the research curriculum. The doctoral program under study utilizes a qualitative-dominant Action Research methodology as its signature pedagogy, integrating cycles of research into coursework before students implement and evaluate their action steps. To ensure students receive a thorough understanding of Action Research methodology, the program requires a four-research course sequence. These courses have been designed with a scaffolded approach that progressively reinforces and extends Action Research methods in ways that promote change agency, inclusivity, and social justice. This research course sequence is designed to build a rigorous foundation for students to conduct high quality Action Research that impacts their professional practice and academic scholarship and leads to transformative learning experiences for students, faculty, organizations, and communities.
