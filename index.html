  Abstract
                  <p>Functional thinking is an established route into algebra. However, the learning mechanisms that support the transition from arithmetic to functional thinking remain unclear. In the current study we explored children’s pre-instructional intuitive reactions to functional thinking content, relying on a conceptual change perspective and using mixed methods. The sample included 20 grade 3 students and 24 grade 5 students. First, we assessed children’s arithmetic skills and intuitive responses to generalisation tasks involving variation tables. The quantitative analysis showed that students’ arithmetic skills correlated with functional aspects such as the following: identifying, and expressing function rules with words but not with the symbolic expression of function rules. The qualitative analysis revealed that students constructed framework theories that generated different intuitive conceptions of the algebraic ideas involved in noticing and expressing generalisation. Students’ conflicts were concentrated in areas that determine key differences between arithmetic and algebra, such as generalisation, indeterminate quantities, and variable notation. We discuss how these results contribute to explaining the construction of algebra concepts.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Relational thinking and dealing with variables are two essential aspects of algebraic thinking. Relational thinking means viewing mathematical expressions and equations as a whole rather than as individual computing processes. It is characterized by using relationships between mathematical objects, and refers to the relations of equality and inequality. In this study, to examine the relational thinking of kindergarten and primary school children, this perspective was applied using non-symbolic representations in the form of boxes and marbles. Using multiple variables is a very powerful but also difficult tool of algebra. The study had the aim of examining how kindergarten children and primary school children establish relationships between several variables which are represented with real materials. The interview study was conducted with children aged 5–10 years. Marbles and different colored boxes represented equations with unknowns and quantities depending on each other. Initially, two approaches could be differentiated, namely, number-oriented and structure-oriented approaches. It could be shown that certain conceptualizations of variables were related to children’s ability to show relational thinking. Kindergarteners are stimulated to think relationally by unknown quantities which can be determined. This process was observed in primary school children dealing with quantities that depended on each other. In addition, the conceptualization of the variables represented as boxes was examined. The concepts of general number and variable as changing quantity were categorized. Further conceptualizations resulted from the interview data, namely, categories of the undeterminable, the specific number, and the quasi-general.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematicians frequently attend their peers’ lectures to learn new mathematical content. The goal of this paper is to investigate what mathematicians learned from the lectures. Our research took place at a 2-week workshop on inner model theory, a topic of set theory, which was largely comprised of a series of lectures. We asked the six workshop organizers and seven conference attendees what could be learned from the lectures in the workshop, and from mathematics lectures in general. A key finding was that participants felt the motivation and road maps that were provided by the lecturers could facilitate the attendees’ future individual studying of the material. We conclude by discussing how our findings inform the development of theory on how individuals can learn from lectures and suggest interesting directions for future research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper focuses on the importance of covariational reasoning within the processes of mathematics teaching and learning. Despite the internationally recognized relevance of covariation, research shows that only a small percentage of students and teachers is able to adopt covariational reasoning and the majority of mathematics curricula do not contain explicit references to covariational skills. In particular, when covariational reasoning manifests as conceptual knowledge, it becomes challenging to assess, and the need for innovative methods of assessment emerges; there is a need for suitable assessment to highlight the characteristics of covariation and capture the various features that characterize conceptual understanding. Comparative judgement (CJ) is an innovative assessment method based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than requiring scoring rubrics. Due to its holistic approach, CJ is particularly suitable for assessing complex mathematical competencies, and, as we shall see in this study, it proved to be appropriate for the covariation’s assessment. In details, our study aims to investigate the perception and relevance attributed by mathematics teachers to covariation as a theoretical construct and the way CJ can help in the assessment of covariational reasoning skills underlying a less structured modelling task.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Multiple representations can enhance students’ understanding of mathematical concepts and complex information but can also pose well-documented challenges for students. Whereas instructional designs have been optimized to support students’ learning with multiple representations, little is known about supportive teaching practices for dealing with multiple representations in whole-class discussions. In this article, we qualitatively investigate two cases of teacher-student interaction in whole-class discussions in grades 10–12 (about the mathematical topic of complex conditional probability information). The analysis aims at decomposing the teaching practices into those actions that can support or hinder students’ understanding. The comparison of cases reveals that teaching practices can vary greatly: simply translating compacted concepts of a given text into other representations (visual area model, symbolic representation of fractions, and three language varieties) seems to be sufficient for students with advanced understanding. Other students need teachers’ supportive actions for unfolding the highly compacted concepts (such as part-of-part) into several concept elements (part, whole, and part-whole relationship) and explicitly connecting (rather than only translating) the concept elements in multiple representations for the different concept elements. The findings can inform both theory building on teaching practices with multiple representations and professional development.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many districts and states have implemented incentives to recruit teachers to low-performing schools, and previous research has found evidence that these incentives are effective at attracting teachers. However, effects on the schools and students these teachers leave behind have not been examined. This study focuses on the spillover effects of recruiting effective teachers to Tennessee’s Innovation Zone (iZone) schools. We find the short-term effects of losing these teachers range from −0.04 to −0.12 SDs in student test score gains, with larger negative effects when more effective teachers leave. However, combining both these negative effects in schools teachers leave and the positive effects in iZone schools yields overall net positive effects.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Colleges and universities are legally required to attempt to prevent and redress sexual violations on campus. Neo-institutional theory suggests that the implementation of law by compliance professionals rarely achieves law’s goals. It is critical in claims-based systems that those who are potential claimants understand the law. This article demonstrates that (a) intended subjects of the law (colleges and universities) interpret and frame the law in very similar ways; (b) resultant policies are complex and difficult to navigate; and (c) university undergraduates in an experimental setting are not able to comprehend the Title IX policies designed to protect them. These findings suggest that current implementations of Title IX policies leave them structurally ineffective to combat sexual assaults on campus.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Philanthropic initiatives incorporating prescriptive practices have become prominent in K–12 education. This study provides evidence on the reach, character, and impact of the Broad Superintendents Academy, a controversial initiative designed to transform district leadership. A novel data set on Broad trainees linked to data on large districts over 20 years shows that Broad superintendents have had extensive reach, serving nearly 3 million students at their peak, and that, for districts that hired Broad trainees, Broad superintendents were 40% more likely to be Black than non-Broad superintendents, although they had significantly shorter tenures. Estimates provide evidence that Broad-trained leaders had little effect on several district outcomes including enrollment, spending, and student completion. However, they initiated a trend toward increased charter school enrollment.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>This study aimed to explore preservice elementary teachers’ use of a bar model as a heuristic for conceptualising relationships between quantities in situations involving ratio and percentages. As a part of a larger project, we focused on two preservice teachers, Maia and Jane, and investigated their solution paths in ratio and percentage problems and the role of the structural representations (i.e., bar model and percent line-bar model) in their solution paths. We analysed these focus participants’ written solutions and their think-aloud process during interviews using three coding phases with a constructivist grounded theory approach. We observed that the problem text fed the construction of the structural representations that served to make sense of the quantities and the relationships among them. Furthermore, the structural representations enhanced Maia and Jane’s mathematical insights about the problem situations. In addition, we observed that preservice teachers’ solution paths were neither linear nor similar, which indicates a mathematical richness in learning. In those solution paths, the model construction played a role in guiding the mathematical operations of constructing and operating on a unit rate in the ratio problem and identifying and operating on a referent whole unit in the percentage problem. We interpreted that variety and nonlinearity in solution paths suggested mathematical richness in learning, the educational implications of which were further discussed.</p>

Previously, we found that teachers gave lower priority to racial equity when disparities were framed as “achievement gaps” (AGs) versus “inequality in educational outcomes.” In this brief, we analyze data from two survey experiments using a teacher sample and an Amazon MTurk sample. We find that (a) the effect of AG language on equity prioritization is moderated by implicit bias, with larger negative effects among teachers holding stronger anti-Black/pro-White stereotypes; (b) the negative effect of AG language replicates with non-teachers; and (c) AG language causes respondents to express more negative racial stereotypes.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the nonpartisan research and analytical arm of the U.S. Congress and is physically and structurally located within the Library of Congress. Despite the role of CRS as a critical information provider and technical assistant to actors crafting and implementing federal policy, CRS reports, which serve as a key mechanism of information dissemination and influence by the organization, only became widely available to the public following the adoption of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. This study uses content analysis to examine CRS’s education-related reports from the 115th Congress to explore what sources are directly and indirectly informing federal policymaking based on references in CRS reports. Findings offer insights into research utilization in the federal education policy process and contribute to the growing literature on intermediary organizations and knowledge brokering.
