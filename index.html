          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The unprecedented challenges of teaching during COVID-19 prompted fears of a mass exodus from the profession. We examine the extent to which these fears were realized using administrative records of Massachusetts teachers between 2015–2016 and 2021–2022. Relative to prepandemic levels, average turnover rates were similar going into the fall of 2020 but increased by 17% (from 15.0% to 17.5%) going into the fall of 2021. The fall 2021 increases were particularly high among newly hired teachers (31% increase) but were lower among Black and Hispanic/Latinx teachers (5% increases among both groups). Gaps in turnover rates between schools serving higher and lower concentrations of economically disadvantaged students narrowed during the first 18 months of the pandemic. The same holds true for gaps in turnover between schools serving higher and lower shares of Black and Hispanic/Latinx students. Together, these findings highlight important differences in teachers’ responses to the pandemic across subgroups and the need to improve early-career retention to ensure long-term stability within the teacher workforce.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teaching practices that are responsive to student thinking are complex and challenging to learn, particularly for novice teachers. Skilled responsive teaching involves adaptive expertise, or the ability to deliberate about and respond to students’ emergent ideas. This study explored the learning of early-career teachers through participation in a video-feedback inquiry group around the enactment of a number talk routine introduced in preservice teacher education. Conceptualizing teacher learning as socially situated within a discourse community, we consider how participation in the asynchronous inquiry group supported both collective interpretations and individual growth in implementing responsive instructional practices. Findings suggest that giving and receiving asynchronous feedback provided novice teachers with opportunities to engage in dialogic conversations that involved several types of deliberation related to responsive teaching and the development of adaptive expertise. This study provides evidence of the potential of asynchronous teacher inquiry groups and the importance of giving, as well as receiving, feedback on practice.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Previous studies have applied interview-oriented self-reported or peer-centered evaluation methods, rather than an objective and quantitative method, to evaluate outcome of a postgraduate capacity-building program and have mainly focused on the cognitive level. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in an international setting and report the results of the outcome evaluation for the behavioral aspect. Research Design: A case–control study. Subjects: Ninety examinees divided into 2 case–control groups: 17 program-experienced doctors and 17 control doctors in the first group, and 28 mentees of the program-experienced doctors and 28 control doctors in the second group. Measures: A six-station OSCE was implemented. The OSCE scores were measured to evaluate (1) the direct educational effect regarding learning in the first group and (2) the indirect educational effects regarding transfer in the second group. Written questionnaire and interview data were collected for qualitative analysis. Results: The quantitative results of the overall or subcomponent OSCE scores indicated no significant differences in the comparisons of the first and second case-control groups. The qualitative data indicated that the program improved participants’ medical knowledge, skills, and self-confidence, however, it also revealed limited learning environment provided by the program. Conclusions: This transnational study has demonstrated the process for introducing and successfully completing the testing of an OSCE in Laos. Discrepancy in the goals of the OSCE and the education program limited the usefulness of OSCE as an assessment tool, leading to the lack of significant differences in its results.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Indigenous education increasingly seeks to reclaim the institutions of state assimilation as spaces for the dissemination and support of localized forms of knowledge and language use and the valorization of alternative citizenship identities. In this study, I compare two schools in Ecuador to show how divergent ways of teaching Kichwa promote or reject state policies of language standardization and the kinds of citizens foregrounded by them. By comparing the schools’ approaches to teaching Kichwa, I call attention to linguistic registers as they carry out or contest predominant forms of citizenship. These examples provide a pathway to study inclusive language policies and classrooms and to understand the multiplicity of ways that citizenship manifestsin communication.

      Abstract
      
                  <p>This study investigates social, mathematical, and sociomathematical norms perceived by college students in an engineering mathematics course and examines the students’ sense of mathematics as signals of individual merit. Data sources include a survey and one-on-one interviews with 38 students. The findings help illustrate student perceptions of academic social norms in a large-lecture course represented by the acquisition model of learning in college, detached from communal and collaborative disciplinary practices. Findings provide insights into the local educational context of an East Asian country as a case study when exam-oriented mathematics is institutionalized as normalcy.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Citizenship is a contested concept that can be interpreted from different – and also conflicting – perspectives. Inspired by inclusive mathematics education, we try to illustrate what it could mean to work toward inclusive citizenship. We illustrate the idea of inclusive mathematics education, showing how deaf and hearing students can learn together. We interpret inclusive mathematics education as ‘meetings amongst differences’. This interpretation inspires us to see meetings amongst differences in a broader perspective. Such meetings can be considered fundamental to the process of establishing inclusive citizenship. We elaborate on this idea by exemplifying how meetings across national, economic, cultural and existential differences can be established in mathematics education. We conclude that, to work toward inclusive citizenship, it is important to establish dialogues across distances; to make students interested in and able to see situations and problems from perspectives different from their own; to construct tolerance as an expression of shared concerns; and finally, to challenge any form of We–Other dichotomy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rer'>Tuesday, 21. February 2023</a> | 
        
          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Clearinghouses set standards of scientific quality to vet existing research to determine how “evidence-based” an intervention is. This paper examines 12 educational clearinghouses to describe their effectiveness criteria, to estimate how consistently they rate the same program, and to probe why their judgments differ. All the clearinghouses value random assignment, but they differ in how they treat its implementation, how they weight quasi-experiments, and how they value ancillary causal factors like independent replication and persisting effects. A total of 1359 programs were analyzed over 10 clearinghouses; 83% of them were assessed by a single clearinghouse and, of those rated by more than one, similar ratings were achieved for only about 30% of the programs. This high level of inconsistency seems to be mostly due to clearinghouses disagreeing about whether a high program rating requires effects that are replicated and/or temporally persisting. Clearinghouses exist to identify “evidence-based” programs, but the inconsistency in their recommendations of the same program suggests that identifying “evidence-based” interventions is still more of a policy aspiration than a reliable research practice.
