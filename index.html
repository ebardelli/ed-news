  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>When learning a new concept, should students engage in problem solving followed by instruction (PS-I) or instruction followed by problem solving (I-PS)? Noting that there is a passionate debate about the design of initial learning, we report evidence from a meta-analysis of 53 studies with 166 comparisons that compared PS-I with I-PS design. Our results showed a significant, moderate effect in favor of PS-I (Hedge’s g 0.36 [95% confidence interval 0.20; 0.51]). The effects were even stronger (Hedge’s g ranging between 0.37 and 0.58) when PS-I was implemented with high fidelity to the principles of Productive Failure (PF), a subset variant of PS-I design. Students’ grade level, intervention time span, and its (quasi-)experimental nature contributed to the efficacy of PS-I over I-PS designs. Contrasting trends were, however, observed for younger age learners (second to fifth graders) and for the learning of domain-general skills, for which effect sizes favored I-PS. Overall, an estimation of true effect sizes after accounting for publication bias suggested a strong effect size favoring PS-I (Hedge’s g 0.87).

  Abstract
                  <p>The important role of student agency in collaborative problem-solving has been acknowledged in previous mathematics education research. However, what remains unknown are the processes of agency in open-ended tasks that draw on real-life contexts and demand argumentation beyond “mathematical”. In this study, we analyse a video recording of two student groups (each consisting of four students) taking part in collaborative problem-solving. We draw on the framework for collaborative construction of mathematical arguments and its interplay with student agency by Mueller et al. (2012). This original framework is supplemented by (i) testing and revising it in the context of open-ended real-life tasks, with (ii) student groups rather than pairs working on the tasks, and by (iii) offering a strengthened methodological pathway for analysing student agency in such a context. Based on our findings, we suggest that the framework suits this new context with some extensions. First, we note that differences in student agency were not only identified in terms of the discourse students drew on, but in how students were able to shift between various discourses, such as between “mathematical” and “non-mathematical” discourses. We identify a novel discourse reflecting student agency, invalidation discourse, which refers to denying other students’ agency by framing their contribution as invalid. Finally, we discuss the need to reframe “mathematical” arguments—and indeed student agency—while the task at hand is open-ended and concerns real-life contexts.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study examined how expert and novice (preservice) teachers solved mathematical modelling tasks as well as how they noticed written artifacts of student thinking that were in response to the mathematical modelling tasks. Some teachers in both groups were aware of the openness and underdetermination of the modelling tasks and that these characteristics implied that underlying assumptions needed to be made in order to solve the tasks. Indeed, nearly all of the expert teachers addressed the need to make assumptions for the Seashell Task. When examining student work, both expert and preservice teachers interpreted positive aspects in the students’ solutions and provided feedback to students. However, almost all of the expert teachers responded by asking questions, whereas around a third of preservice teachers directly corrected students’ mistakes and another third pointed out mistakes without correcting them. This study provides a new angle to study teachers’ mathematical competencies, the assessment of modelling competencies, and considerations for the development of teachers’ modelling competencies.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>In response to Fuson et al.’s commentary on Litkowski et al. (2020), we clarify and expand on three areas: (1) the need for prekindergarten standards, (2) the value in developmental survey work, and (3) the importance of understanding curriculum translation and uptake. Specifically, we note that standards need to be appropriate for grade-level and it is time for more aligned prekindergarten standards. Developmental survey work is critical for ensuring that standards and expectations are accurate and adjusted to meet current needs and can be used address equity issues in instruction. Furthermore, we agree that intervention and curriculum work are needed, but there should be explicit emphasis on enhancing uptake and use of high-quality instruction. Ultimately, we need a system of assessment and instruction that is continually updated and improved, that integrates and modifies new evidence over time to ensure that we are striving for—and attaining—the best results for young children.

  Abstract
                  <p>Modelling competencies are currently included in numerous curricula worldwide and are generally accepted as a complex, process-oriented construct. Therefore, effective measurement should include multiple dimensions, like the sub-competencies required throughout the modelling process. Departing from the characteristics of modelling problems as open and often underdetermined real-world problems, we propose to enrich the current conceptualisation of mathematical modelling competencies by including creativity, which plays an important role in numerous phases of the mathematical modelling process but has scarcely been considered in modelling discourse. In the study described in this paper, a new instrument for the evaluation of this enriched construct has been developed and implemented. The modelling competencies incorporating creativity of the students were evaluated based on the adequacy of the models and the modelling processes proposed, and the appropriateness and completeness of the approaches were evaluated in detail. Adapting measurement approaches for creativity that have been developed in the problem-solving discourse, certain criteria of creativity were selected to evaluate the creativity of the students’ approaches in tackling modelling problems—namely, usefulness, fluency, and originality. The empirical study was conducted among 107 Chinese students at the upper secondary school level, who attended a modelling camp and independently solved three complex modelling problems. The results reveal significant correlations between fluency and originality in students’ performances across all tasks; however, the relationships between usefulness and the other two creativity aspects were not consistent. Overall, the results of the study support the importance of the inclusion of creativity in the construct of modelling competencies.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>System-wide educational reforms are difficult to implement in the United States, but despite the difficulties, reforms can be successful, particularly when they are associated with broad public support. This study reports on the nature of the public sentiment expressed about a nationwide science education reform effort, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Through the use of data science techniques to measure the sentiment of posts on Twitter about the NGSS (N = 565,283), we found that public sentiment about the NGSS is positive, with only 11 negative posts for every 100 positive posts. In contrast to findings from past research and public opinion polling on the Common Core State Standards, sentiment about the NGSS has become more positive over time—and was especially positive for teachers. We discuss what this positive sentiment may indicate about the success of the NGSS in light of opposition to the Common Core State Standards.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, I report the results of a study of a large-scale implementation of an evidence-based, objective-oriented approach to teaching via digital platforms among mathematics teachers in Denmark. The aim of the study was to investigate how these platforms affect the work of mathematics teachers and how emergent problems in this process can be addressed from an implementation perspective. This objective was achieved by applying concepts from the theory of instrumental genesis to analyze ethnographical data of teachers’ platform usage and data from participatory workshops. The results of the study indicate that the design of platforms is likely to conflict with the needs of mathematics teachers and thus I argue for the need of addressing such issues by supporting teachers in enacting innovations rather than by redesigning them. Furthermore, in the paper I suggest that future workshop is an adequate format to support such enactments.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Research has shown that students’ beliefs related to mathematics are connected to their affect and motivation as well as their mathematical thinking and activity. Moreover, high parental expectations have been shown to play a role in students’ positive beliefs and self-efficacy. This paper reports on two studies investigating parental expectations related to students’ beliefs and their perceived achievement. These studies highlighted an unusual, but confirmed finding that students who do not perceive that their parents have specific mathematics achievement expectations show more positive mathematics-related beliefs and higher perceived mathematics achievement than students who believe their parents do have specific expectations. This paper explores possible reasons for this finding related to parents’ methods of conveying their expectations.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the development of a guidance document titled the “Framework for Equitable Instruction” (Framework), which aims to support multilingual students’ content-area learning and language development. The Framework was developed by WIDA, a national consortium of states, as part of its system of language standards, assessments, and professional learning. The article discusses the Framework using a protocol originally created for the alignment of content-area and language standards. The protocol highlights the rigorous theoretical foundations of the Framework, the research-based rationale behind its conceptualization of language trajectories, and the tight linkages between the Framework, content-area standards, and classroom instruction. The systematic exploration of the Framework’s features in this article can inform the future design of language standards and related documents and serve as a foundation for the constructive critique of existing ones.

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of the paper is to show whether the systems of mathematics teacher education in two countries whose historical development may seem quite similar (the Czech Republic and Hungary were parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, and they were part of the Eastern European communist block) are also very similar, or whether each country follows its own, unique path. In this paper we build on the general need for more international comparative studies in the area of teacher education. We present a historical review of development of mathematics teacher education in both countries and analyse and compare current teacher education programs, their structure and organization, the demands on mathematics teachers and their qualifications for teaching at various levels. In the paper we pinpoint a number of aspects resulting in differences in the two systems, including historical development and traditions, (de)-centralization, globalization and international cooperation, etc. The comparison based on these aspects shows that the systems in both countries are very different. The analysis described in this paper could become the starting point for further research using the data from international surveys (e.g. PISA). Such research would enable us to make conjectures about the effects of various ways of organizing teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we discuss students’ opportunities to learn to pose mathematical problems, based on a historical analysis of problem posing in the area of number and algebra in six series of Chinese primary school mathematics textbooks published since the 1950s. We examine changes in the proportion and distribution of the problem-posing tasks, and in the presentation of the problem-posing tasks. Our results show a decreasing number of problem-posing tasks as grade level increases, even though problem posing has become more important in mathematics education in China during the last 70 years. This study also provides a variety of examples of problem-posing tasks which could serve as a reference for teachers in other countries in designing and employing problem-posing tasks in the classroom.</p>
