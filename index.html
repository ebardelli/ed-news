  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we describe how a teacher makes decisions during interaction with students in order to guide their focus towards the lesson’s objectives that the teacher has in mind. In particular, in the paper we examine how a mathematics teacher’s knowledge connects with the teacher’s noticing skill and interactive action. We present the case of a competent Japanese teacher, Mr. T, during a series of nine lessons on comparing fractions in a fifth-grade classroom. We first look at how Mr. T structured the lessons and interactions to help the students shift their focus from the procedural aspects to the quantitative aspects, when generating their explanations concerning how to compare fractions. Then, we analyze how Mr. T interpreted the students’ responses and made decisions about his interactive actions in the two lessons. The results show that Mr. T structured the entire lessons by repeatedly eliciting students’ ideas and focusing on the object of examination. Detailed analysis of three vignettes shows Mr. T’s constant reference to the lesson objectives when attending to and interpreting the students’ thinking both in verbal and written form. Furthermore, he strove to adjust his initial decisions according to the students’ reactions. These processes of noticing the students’ mathematical thinking were made possible by his extensive content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge; in particular, his knowledge of figural representation had a significant influence on his decision-making.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Most parents consider private supplementary tutoring (PT) as an effective means of improving academic achievement. However, previous studies on this method have produced either partial or inconclusive results on its effectiveness. Thus, in the present study we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the learning of middle school students in China, with specific focus on the final year of middle school. The analysis was based on a specially designed longitudinal survey of private supplementary tutoring in mathematics. An analysis using hierarchical linear regression showed that regular private tutoring, throughout the school years, could have a minor effect on students’ mathematical achievements by the final year of middle school. These results suggest that parents should make careful choices for their children’s private tutoring, and the government must issue comprehensive, professional guidelines to regulate the private tutoring industry. Moreover, other countries could find major take-aways from the Chinese experience of private tutoring for enhancing students’ mathematical performances.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this special issue we introduce the state of the art of empirical studies on creativity in mathematics and mathematics education. To do so we conducted a retrospective analysis of empirical studies on mathematical creativity with special attention to the studies conducted during the last decade. In the paper we present a brief survey of research on mathematical creativity up to 2009 and then a detailed review of empirical studies performed during the past decade. We note an optimistic development of attention paid to mathematical creativity in schools. A systematic search conducted to examine research on creativity in mathematics education journals and research in the field of mathematics in creativity-related journals, yielded 49 papers that described empirical studies on creativity in mathematics education. The retrospective analysis examined the following: (a) the main goals of the studies; (b) conceptual frameworks used by the researchers; (c) research methodologies; and (d) tools and tasks. Of these, 18 studies examined the relationships between creativity in mathematics and other characteristics, 25 were on creativity related to instructional practices and mathematical tasks, and 6 studies investigated teachers’ creativity-related conceptions and competencies. Of these studies, 29 used quantitative methodologies, 10 of which integrated analysis for problem solving or problem posing strategies or outcomes. Ten additional studies employed qualitative methodology (mainly content analysis of lesson observations). We conclude the paper with a short review of papers in this special issue, and outline directions for future research on creativity in mathematics (education).</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many selective colleges consider the backgrounds of applicants to improve equity in admissions. However, this information is usually not available for all applicants. We examine whether the chances of admission and enrollment changed after 43 colleges gained access to a new tool that standardizes information on educational disadvantage for all applicants. Applicants from the most challenging school and neighborhood backgrounds experienced a 5-percentage point increase in the probability of admission in the year of adoption relative to similar applicants in the previous year. The tool did not alter the probability of enrollment as a function of applicant challenge level in the full sample, but positive changes are concentrated among applicants to institutions that used the tool to allocate financial aid.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics Challenge for Young Australians is a unique enrichment program that has been produced annually by the Australian Mathematics Trust since 1991. In its present form, it is divided into four levels and caters for talented students from years 3 to 10. In a typical year, it attracts over 15,000 entries. Individual schools arrange a period of up to four weeks in the first half of the academic year for students to work on their prescribed set of the problems and write full solutions. Limited collaboration among students is permitted and encouraged. There is a strong emphasis on articulating clearly the reasoning in solutions with sound and complete presentation. A guide containing marking schemes is provided for teachers to help them assess their students' work. It also includes discussion points and extension questions, which are relevant to each problem and may be used by the teacher for further enrichment activity. This paper discusses the history, aims, and structure of the program. It describes how problems are designed by the Challenge Committee to engage the students and develop their problem-solving skills. A range of past Challenge problems are presented to illustrate their construction, diversity, levels of difficulty, and relevance to educational objectives.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate seventh-grade students’ visuospatial thinking processes in an art studio environment, where students were engaged with geometrically rich artworks. The students were asked to observe minimalist artworks, then create and critique their own and others’ artworks based on the Studio Thinking Framework. Data were collected through interviews conducted with students, video recordings in the studio, and students’ documents (sketches, artworks, and notes). The data were analyzed based on previous studies on spatial thinking and emergent data. The study’s findings indicate that the Studio Thinking-based environment has the potential to elicit students’ visuospatial thinking processes, mainly in recognizing shapes, decomposing and composing shapes, patterning, and transforming shapes rigidly and non-rigidly (scaling). The present study, which includes accounts of three studio works, suggests an emergent framework for the characterization of visuospatial thinking within a particular art-math-related environment. The findings of the study shed light on other studies on visual arts and mathematics education and on mathematical thinking and learning in informal learning settings.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes an embedded case study of “blended” teaching integrated with traditional lessons in a Student-Centered Active Learning Environment and social activities on the platform. The didactic phenomena were designed by creating learning environments, artifacts, and teaching/learning sequences in authentic educational contexts. We aim at improving the task design of a mathematics lesson with an impact on students’ performance in mathematics. Quantitative results show considerable benefits in the evolution of the use and coordination of several systems of semiotic representation. As a result, a better predisposition to the study of the subject seems to appear; moreover, the satisfaction test shows the achievement of alternative teaching methodologies for most of the students.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Colleges and universities have increasingly worried in recent decades about college students’ well-being, with the COVID-19 pandemic aggravating these concerns. Our study examines changes to undergraduate emotional sentiments and psychological well-being from before to after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we explore whether certain risk factors (i.e., prior mental health impairments, trait emotional stability) and protective factors (i.e., subjective socioeconomic status, parental education, household resources) predicted students’ emotions and their intraindividual changes due to the pandemic onset. We compared experience sampling method data from 120 students from before and after the pandemic onset, examining intraindividual trajectories. There was only little change in students’ emotions. Prior mental health impairment and trait emotional stability predicted students’ emotions, averaged across time points, but not emotion changes. Few associations with emotions were found for subjective socioeconomic status and parental education, but study-related household resources predicted levels and changes in emotions.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, a growing number of studies have applied regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) to the analysis of prominent regional economic development and business incentive policies. As a result, impact evaluations of these policy interventions are being increasingly commissioned under the assumption that local linear regressions have superior impact identification properties in the cases in which an eligibility boundary, geographical border or application cutoff is identifiable as a source of treatment assignment. This paper shows that in a number of frequently encountered cases, however, economic development and business incentive programs pose peculiar impact identification conditions in terms of violations of main assumptions for the validity of RDDs and of running variables that have little or no influence of the outcome variable. Under these circumstances, that bear generalizable relevance also for the analysis of other public programs at large, no adequate testing to support the internal validity of the applied discontinuity design is often performed in the literature and the use of local linear/polynomial regressions, or cross-border comparisons, becomes an inadequate choice. When these conditions apply, adopting instead other quasi-experimental methods to achieve an actual adequate treatment-control balance of the relevant baseline characteristic will often be a better approach.JEL classification; O1; R5; C23

  Abstract
                  <p>In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created by the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18 million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals are distributed to public school students. In the following year these students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of boys. This distinction is accentuated with the age of the students and in the grades of students in the upper percentiles of the exam.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling, along with the educational discourse surrounding these, have many connections. However, ways that the educational discourse on discrete mathematics can benefit from the inclusion of examples of mathematical modelling and the accompanying discussion are currently under-researched. In this paper, we elaborate on the educational potential of examples of mathematical modelling based on the usage of methods from discrete mathematics, with a focus on secondary education. We first describe vertex-edge graphs as possible topics of discrete mathematics that are accessible at school level within modelling lessons. Secondly, in the context of a case study, we describe modelling activities with students at the end of lower-secondary education, using a classical problem of discrete mathematics originating from the Königsberg bridge problem. The students’ solution processes for this optimisation problem based on graph theory are described. Their approaches are examined referring to the phases of the modelling cycle, using the method of qualitative content analysis. We studied in particular the extent to which students use concepts related to vertex-edge graphs in specific sub-phases of the modelling process. The analysis allows the required sub-competences of modelling to be identified and the connection of these competences with discrete mathematics to be worked out. On the basis of this analysis, educational opportunities of teaching discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling are assessed. Overall, we point out the possibilities and opportunities for using examples from the field of discrete mathematics to acquire modelling competences and to foster the linkage of mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics at school level.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past several decades, housing costs have risen sharply, and as a result, an increasing number of families have become “housing cost burdened,” paying more than one third of their income toward rent and utilities. This integrative literature synthesis considers the known and potential impacts of families’ housing affordability problems on child development and schooling outcomes through a review of 64 studies published between 2000 and 2020. The synthesis proceeds in three sections: the first section examines research on the direct connection between affordability and child outcomes. The second section considers the empirical evidence on four pathways through which affordability problems are theorized to affect child outcomes: the residential mobility pathway (by causing residential mobility, school mobility, eviction, or homelessness), the living environment pathway (by reducing the quality of housing or living conditions), the neighborhood and school opportunity pathway (by restricting access to high-opportunity neighborhoods and schools), and the parental resources pathway (by reducing financial resources that could be invested in children and increasing parental stress). The third section of the synthesis considers affordability’s impact on children through an examination of the research literature on the impact of federal housing assistance. Future directions for policy are considered, including the expansion of housing assistance for families, and additional research is urged on the impacts of housing affordability on children by scholars within the field of education.

  Evaluation Review, Volume 46, Issue 2, Page 200-230, April 2022. <br>The objective of this study is to measure the effects of state aid distributed to private enterprises in North Macedonia on the enterprises’ efficiency. We examine the governmental Plan for Economic Growth (PEG) pursued through the Financial Support of Investment Law (FSIL) and the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development (FITD). We rely on a rigorous impact evaluation method, whereby comparison groups are sourced from the pool of rejected applicants for the two programs. We pursue conditional matching on firms’ observables and then apply the difference-in-differences method to isolate the effect of the subsidy. FSIL State Aid showed largely ineffective, with producing hardly any difference in sales, investment, wages, or profits among recipients, except employment. These results demonstrate the absence of the incentive effect as it relates to FSIL state aid. On the other hand, the FITD State Aid showed to be considerably effective, as the recipients were found to have increased their sales revenue and their investment in technology and profits, corroborating the presence of the incentive effect as it relates to FITD state aid. Notwithstanding the legitimacy of the policy objective to equalize domestic and foreign firms in terms of their access to state aid, these findings document partial failure of the PEG to do so due to its structural problems.JEL classification: H25, C90
