          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>We study a decade of achievement gaps for fifth-, eighth-, and 10th-grade students in Norway using administrative population data. Norway is a wealthy and egalitarian country with a homogeneous educational system, yet achievement gaps between students at the 90th and 10th percentiles of parental income and between students whose parents have at least a master and at most a high school degree are found to be large (0.55–0.93 and 0.70–0.99 SD), equivalent to about 2 to 2.5 years of schooling, and increasing by grade level. Achievement gaps by parental income, but not by parental education, increased over the time period, underscoring the different ways these two socioeconomic status components relate to achievement and the potential for policy to alter gaps.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>For decades, charter schools have been promoted as a panacea for increasing competition in the educational marketplace. Supporters argue that increased choice forces neighboring schools to innovate, while opponents contend that charters “skim” students and funds away from traditional public schools (TPS). We test the two differing views by comparing academic achievement and school segregation in TPS in South Florida facing competition from charter schools compared to TPS with no competition. We find that when a charter school moves into the community, it fails to substantively change test scores or diversity of the nearby TPS, even 10 years after a charter is established.

          Abstract
                  <p>We study the ideas about teaching and learning mathematics that undergraduate students generate when they encounter tasks designed to embed approximations of teaching practice in mathematics courses taken by a general population of students. These tasks attend to the dual goals of developing an understanding of mathematics content and an understanding of how teachers provide classroom experiences that foster mathematics learning. The study employs a qualitative, multiple-case study methodology, with four cases bounded by the content areas of abstract algebra, single variable calculus, discrete mathematics, and introductory statistics. The data for the study come from undergraduate students’ written work on mathematical tasks, interviews with a subset of students from each course, and interviews with each instructor throughout the term during which they implemented the tasks. Our findings indicate that students identified the broad applicability of teaching skills (discussed by 32 of the 61 interviewed students), recognized the value of examining hypothetical learners’ mathematical work (discussed by 59 of the 61 interviewed students), and reported empathy for hypothetical learners (discussed by 38 of the 61 interviewed students). These findings persisted across the course content and course levels we studied, leading us to conclude that our findings can transfer to additional mathematics courses in secondary mathematics teacher preparation.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Under test-based accountability, side-effects —including practices to inflate test results, often seen as cheating—are usually associated to so-called high-stakes policies. However, the influence of different types of stakes in the generation of this type of practices has been overlooked in education research. Based on a survey experiment, our results indicate that the type and level of stakes of accountability systems (e.g., high- vs. low-stakes, material vs. symbolic) do not differ in triggering side-effects. Counterintuitively, individual symbolic consequences trigger similar reactions among teachers than material incentives. In-depth interviews give insights into the social mechanisms that lead to symbolic effects having such an influence in understanding teachers’ reactivity to accountability.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 811-841, December 2022. <br>Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs) are increasingly being used to evaluate interventions in medical, public health, educational, and social science contexts. With the longitudinal and crossover natures of an SW-CRT, complex analysis techniques are often needed, which makes appropriately powering SW-CRTs challenging. In this article, we introduce a newly developed SW-CRT power calculator embedded within the power command in Stata. The power calculator assumes a marginal model (that is, generalized estimating equations) for the primary analysis of SW-CRTs, for which other currently available SW-CRT power calculators may not be suitable. The command accommodates complete cross-sectional and closed-cohort designs and includes multilevel correlation structures appropriate for such designs. We discuss the methods and formulas underlying our SW-CRT calculator and provide illustrative examples of the use of power swgee. We provide suggestions about the choice of parameters in power swgee and conclude by discussing areas of future research that may improve the command.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 941-957, December 2022. <br>Portfolio analysis is widely used in empirical asset pricing to explore the cross-sectional relation between two or more variables. In this article, we introduce the methodology of portfolio analysis and describe a new command, portfolio, that provides a one-step solution for portfolio analysis. portfolio calculates the equal- or value-weighted returns with a t statistic for the portfolio and tests the significance of a long-short strategy in portfolios. portfolio also provides the Newey–West standard-error adjustment option for alleviating the impact of potential autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in financial time series.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 958-968, December 2022. <br>In this article, we introduce the printcase command, which outputs data from a specific observation into an easy-to-read Microsoft Word or PDF document. printcase allows analysts to focus on a single observation within a dataset and view that observation in its entirety. The output displays fields in table format, with all variables identified by their corresponding labels and all responses identified by their corresponding value labels. We explain how printcase works, give examples of circumstances under which this type of table-based quasiquestionnaire would be useful, and provide code for printing single observations.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 884-907, December 2022. <br>In this article, we introduce qpair as a new command written in Stata for the analysis of paired Q-sorts in Q-methodology, which is used for studying subjective issues and is a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The quantitative component of Q-methodology employs a by-person factor analysis technique. However, currently there is no systematic approach for analyzing paired Q-sorts or longitudinal data in Q-methodology. We introduce the only statistical command available for the analysis of paired Q-sorts. The qpair command employs the factor extraction and factor rotation techniques in Stata. The command is illustrated using a dataset representing perceptions of 50 information technology professionals on person–organization fit regarding their training and development priorities.

      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/stja?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R'>Thursday, 05. January 2023</a> | 
        
          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 842-883, December 2022. <br>The regression control method, also known as the panel-data approach for program evaluation (Hsiao, Ching, and Wan, 2012, Journal of Applied Econometrics 27: 705–740; Hsiao and Zhou, 2019, Journal of Applied Econometrics 34: 463–481), is a convenient method for causal inference in panel data that exploits cross-sectional correlation to construct counterfactual outcomes for a single treated unit by linear regression. In this article, we present the rcm command, which efficiently implements the regression control method with or without covariates. Available methods for model selection include best subset, lasso, and forward stepwise and backward stepwise regression, while available selection criteria include the corrected Akaike information criterion, the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, the modified Bayesian information criterion, and cross-validation. Estimation and counterfactual predictions can be made by ordinary least squares, lasso, or postlasso ordinary least squares. For statistical inference, both the in-space placebo test using fake treatment units and the in-time placebo test using a fake treatment time can be implemented. The rcm command produces a series of graphs for visualization along the way. We demonstrate the use of the rcm command by revisiting classic examples of political and economic integration between Hong Kong and mainland China (Hsiao, Ching, and Wan 2012) and German reunification (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2015, American Journal of Political Science 59: 495–510).

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 924-940, December 2022. <br>In this article, we introduce a new command, cspa, that implements the conditional superior predictive ability test developed in Li, Liao, and Quaedvlieg (2022, Review of Economic Studies 89: 843–875). With the conditional performance of predictive methods measured nonparametrically by the conditional expectation functions of their predictive losses, we test the null hypothesis that a benchmark model weakly outperforms a collection of competitors uniformly across the conditioning space. The proposed command can implement this test for both independent cross-sectional data and serially dependent time-series data. Confidence sets for the most superior model can be obtained by inverting the test, for which the cspa command also offers a convenient implementation.

Using the recent Stata/Python integration platform introduced in Stata 16, these commands provide hyperparameters’ optimal tuning via K-fold cross-validation using grid search. More specifically, they use the Python Scikitlearn application programming interface to carry out both cross-validation and outcome/label prediction.

I also survey the myticks command for tick placement. In all commands, the main output is a local macro in the calling program’s space, in the interest of promoting automation in do-files and programs.

The estimators are the ratio of mean counts (r 1), ratio of mean cluster-level event rates (r 2), ratio of event rates (r 3), double ratio of counts (r 4), and double ratio of event rates (r 5). r 1, r 2, and r 3 estimate the total effect, which comprises the direct and indirect effects; r 4 and r 5 estimate the direct effect. We describe a new command, crtrest, that provides these ratio estimators and their standard errors in nonmatched and matched-pair cluster randomized trials.

The incidence rate is defined as the ratio between the total number of events and total follow-up time and can be estimated with the strate command. When the event of interest can occur multiple times on any given subject over a time period, like infections, the incidence rate represents an average count per unit of time, such as the average number of infections per year. When the event of interest can occur only once, such as death, an alternative summary measure is the risk, or probability, of occurrence per unit time, such as the risk of dying in one year. In this article, I present the stprisk command, which estimates risks, and illustrate its use and interpretation through a data example.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper introduces the term explorative mathematical argumentation (EMA), signifying a concept for describing and analysing learners’ mathematical argumentation processes. Despite multiple recent empirical evidence for argumentation promoting learning in science education, still little is known about the development of early mathematical argumentation skills and their role within early learning processes. The widely varying use of the term argumentation impedes respective research efforts. The concept of explorative mathematical argumentation offers an approach that takes into account the explorative nature of learners’ knowledge construction as well as specific aspects of mathematical argumentation. The concept of EMA promotes mathematical argumentation as a separate competence facet within which different forms and tools of reasoning can be deployed. It is suitable for describing and analysing learners’ mathematical argumentation processes from an early age onwards, as is illustrated by an exemplary situation with 4- and 5-year-old preschool children. Eventually, methods for identifying and analysing learners’ explorative mathematical argumentation processes are presented for discussion.</p>
