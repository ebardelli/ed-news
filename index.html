  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>In this article, we argue that healing from trauma in a racialized context requires an act of collective, critical resistance whereby educators and researchers reject a White-dominant colonial perspective of trauma on the grounds that it is pathologizing in several ways. We introduce a holistic trauma framework for understanding and responding to trauma within a racialized context. First, our framework seeks to draw on multiple forms of knowledge and experience to gain a deeper sense of trauma, suffering, and healing. Second, it uses an organic approach to promote relationships and support healing. Third, our framework explores multiple timepoints by introducing proactive, interactive, and reactive approaches for addressing trauma more comprehensively. We hope our framework will enhance the field of trauma research, which is, at present, overpopulated by White-dominant, colonial perspectives that mask systemic racial inequities.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>An important way to address the literacy needs of English learners (ELs) is to ensure that ELs receive evidence-based literacy instruction and intervention. To support teachers’ implementation of this instruction and intervention, it is necessary to provide effective professional development (PD). In this systematic review, we synthesized 19 studies that investigated PD on literacy instruction and intervention for ELs. Findings revealed that although PD often targets teachers’ implementation of literacy instruction, PD is less likely to focus on teachers’ implementation of literacy interventions for ELs experiencing reading difficulties. Nonetheless, PD programs typically resulted in positive changes in teachers’ knowledge and practices. However, only 12 of the studies reported on student outcomes. We conclude with research and practical implications related to PD for teachers of ELs that is responsive to the needs of ELs.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the research reported in this paper, using a modified version of the interconnected model of teacher professional growth (IMTPG) proposed by Clarke and Hollingsworth (Teaching Teacher Educ 18:947–967, 2002), we aimed to understand the learning dynamics in a lesson study of a group of five teachers of grades 5–6, during their work around mathematical tasks and in the elaboration and analysis of a diagnostic test of students’ knowledge. We draw on examples from a lesson study that took place in a school in Lisbon, involving five teachers that constituted the whole mathematics group of the school. The main feature of our adaptation is the consideration of a Group Domain instead of the Personal Domain of the original model. In the original model, the Domain of Practice had a broad definition but usually it was restricted to classroom experimentation. In the research reported in this paper, the lesson study sessions were taken as part of the Domain of Practice. For data collection, there was audio and video recording of the lesson study sessions and of the research lesson and the writing of a research journal. Data analysis was done using the modified IMTPG. The results suggest that this model is helpful in understanding the processes that make lesson study a valuable professional development setting, contributing to responding to the question of ‘how lesson study works’ (Lewis et al., Theory and practices of lesson study in mathematics: an international perspective, Springer, New York, 2019). In addition, the use of this model showed that the lesson study promoted the teachers’ development regarding knowledge of didactics, especially knowledge of students and their learning processes and of teaching practice.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Drawing bar diagrams has been shown to improve performance on mathematical word problems wherein the relational keyword is consistent with the required arithmetic operation. This study extends this by testing the effectiveness of bar diagram drawing for word problems with an inconsistent keyword-arithmetic operation mapping. Seventy-five fifth graders solved consistent and inconsistent word problems while encouraged to draw bar diagrams. For each word problem, we assessed problem type (consistent/inconsistent), performance (correct/incorrect), and bar diagrams (accurate/inaccurate/no drawing). Overall, bar diagram drawing was associated with increased performance on both consistent and inconsistent word problems, but the strongest benefits of drawing were found for inconsistent word problems. For inconsistent word problems, bar diagram accuracy was more clearly related to performance (accurate bar diagrams related to correct answers, but inaccurate ones to incorrect answers) than for consistent word problems. We conclude that bar diagram drawing provides an effective graphical support for solving inconsistent word problems.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite substantial evidence of the effectiveness of—and the need for—culturally relevant education (CRE), it has been treated by many schools as a professional choice or new initiative rather than a fundamental approach to teaching in a multicultural, democratic society. Moreover, efforts to implement CRE across schools and districts have recently been met by strong opposition from well-organized groups. In this essay, the authors point to scientific, legal, and ethical arguments for why CRE should be considered a noncontroversial, evidence-based approach to education. The authors then draw on insights from political psychology and critical Whiteness studies to argue that the opposition to CRE is unlikely to be overcome through the evidence they present. The arguments therefore are meant not to convince critics but rather to bolster educational leaders’ resolve to stand strong in the face of opposition. The authors conclude with specific recommendations for how districts might begin the work of institutionalizing CRE so that the approach ultimately becomes taken for granted and alternatives cease to be considered.

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>

  Abstract
                  <p>Undergraduate students are expected to produce and comprehend constructive existence proofs; yet, these proofs are notoriously difficult for students.

  Abstract
                  <p>Undergraduate students are expected to produce and comprehend constructive existence proofs; yet, these proofs are notoriously difficult for students. This study investigates students’ thinking about these proofs by asking students to validate two arguments for the existence of a mathematical object. The first argument featured a common structural error while the second was a valid argument of the claim. We found that the students often considered the logical structures of the arguments when validating them. They provided reasons for their evaluations, including why they thought the structure of the first argument functioned to prove the claim and why they thought the structure of the second argument did not function to prove the claim. We discuss how these reasons provide insights into why constructive existence proofs might be challenging for students. We end the paper with implications for the teaching and learning of constructive existence proofs and their proof frameworks.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Integration is an important, albeit difficult, goal of science and mathematics education. This paper presents a framework and a research design proposal to identify preservice teachers’ (PSTs) integration performance of science and mathematics (IPoSM). It also presents the classification of PSTs’ level of integration in each phase of a problem-based learning (PBL) activity, within the proposed framework, and evidence of their work. The framework is organized in three levels of integration, based on current research, and detailed with specific integration indicators about an exemplary PBL activity, named STEM Bees. This PBL activity was structured as a research problem divided into two integrated problems. A qualitative methodology was used, focused on the application of the framework to the work of PSTs in that PBL activity. The final participants were 13 PSTs, organized in four working groups. In general, results show that PSTs’ integration performance was higher with the second problem than with the first problem. However, full integration with meaningful connections between science and mathematics ideas was achieved by almost all PST at the conclusion of the research problem. The IPoSM framework indicators proved to be useful for identifying the level of integration of science and mathematics in PSTs’ work in each phase of the PBL activity. Keeping the IPoSM framework in mind, teacher educators could elaborate more effective problem-based integrated approaches of science and mathematics in initial teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Constantly on the lookout for Canadian mathematics education matters, I recently experienced a major personal tipping point. The juxtaposition of two different customer service situations was simply too much for me to handle. Now through the looking glass, it was abundantly clear that tipping in Canada is unconscious, and the evidence was everywhere. The current state of financial literacy education in Canadian schools, the opportunity that COVID-19 has provided for us to renew Canada’s implied gratuity guidelines, and an investigation into pre- and post-tax bill totals all supported my assertion that the tipping culture in Canada is a habit in many senses of the word. A look back at how tipping in Canada has evolved from parting with a few coins every once and a while, and a look at the evolution of the point of sale terminal, which I refer to as ‘The Machine’, helped me realize that I am unable to move on and start looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters just yet. After all, if Canadian mathematics education matters, then Canadian mathematics education matters. As such, Part II of this article follows in the next issue. Stay tuned.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Properties of arithmetic operations are important in mathematics and play a significant role in elementary school students’ learning of mathematics. At the same time, it is quite challenging to help students learn arithmetic operational properties beyond memorization, so that they know when and how to use a specific arithmetic property. This paper reports a study containing two parts to explore students’ learning of the Commutative Property of Addition (CPA) as related to the content presentation in textbooks. Part one is to assess selected students’ performance on CPA at the end of Grade two, and part two is to explore possible contributions of textbooks to students’ performance in Shanghai. Firstly, we evaluated the performance of 41 second-graders on CPA by collecting data through a paper-and-pencil test, which was followed up with individual interviews. Through analyzing how textbooks present and organize this topic, we sought to better understand from a curriculum standpoint how students’ performance on CPA is impacted by textbooks. Results revealed that Shanghai textbooks make a positive contribution to students’ learning performance. The findings from this study help to shed light on how those textbooks aid student learning, and provide an example for further reflection on student learning of arithmetic operational properties in different curricula.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The world currently faces many globally connected and locally specific challenges that stimulate new ideas and expectations for science education. One response to these challenges has been development of visions for school science that seek to foster social responsibility in learners, encouraging them to take a critical stance towards products of science and technology while also empowering them to reduce potential harm these products have on individuals, societies, and environments. Recently, varying degrees of socially responsible science education have made their way into national and provincial curriculum documents; however, limited guidance on how to implement, critique, and adapt such visions to various contexts can stifle reform. In this article, we examined four frameworks which can support socially responsible science education, reviewed opportunities and challenges teachers feel are associated with their implementation, and used the review to provide recommendations for future interventions. We found teachers typically agree the frameworks benefit student learning by providing a context for students to use and learn science. They perceive system-level factors such as an aligned curriculum to be critical, where curricular content, competencies, and assessment requirements should reflect the aims and overall methods of the frameworks. Regardless of curricular alignment, concerns raised by teachers point to intervention strategies. They should include a focus on teachers’ context and practice, being sustained over a period that allows for deep exploration, while in collaboration with other educators or knowledgeable others. Directions for future research and policy are discussed.</p>

                  <p>To analyze the impact of illustrations on solving mathematical word problems for primary school students, in this study we investigated systematically the functions of illustrations in terms of various presentations of texts and illustrations, and the difficulties associated with various learning materials. The characteristics of eye movement were studied with regard to the effect of split attention by using eye trackers. The results revealed the following: the presentation format of integrated texts and illustrations worked the best for problem solving under the condition of mathematical word problems with illustrations; the difficulty of the problem affected the role of illustrations; a high frequency of attention switching between texts and illustrations and longer fixation durations on the required picture provided evidence for the split attention effect using an eye-movement index. Based on these results, using more visual and verbal representations helps students solve mathematical word problems.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>From the socio-critical perspective of mathematical modeling, reflexive discussions about the nature, criteria, and consequences of mathematical models are not a natural consequence of modeling in school. This report is part of a larger study focused on stimulating reflexive discussions in practice employing constructivist grounded theory as a research method. Twenty-seven college algebra students engaged in a 3-week modeling project at a community college in the USA. Audio-recorded group discussions and written reflections were collected to determine how reflexive discussions were taking place. Analysis of students’ actions and reflexive discussions during the modeling project produced four concepts: voicing mathematics, personalizing mathematics, challenging mathematics, and negotiating mathematics. These concepts are integrated into an overall process for stimulating reflexive discussions and are conceptualized as unboxing mathematics. The overarching concept of unboxing mathematics represents one interpretation of how reflexive discussions may be constituted during modeling activities and identifies classroom mathematical practices specific to the socio-critical modeling context of this study.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In the spring of 2020, schools and universities around the world were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative lockdown affected more than 1.5 billion learners as teachers and students sheltered at home for several weeks. As schooling moved online, teachers were forced to change how they taught. In the research presented here, we focus on university mathematics professors, and we analyze how their practice, knowledge, and beliefs intertwine and change under these circumstances. More specifically, the context of the pandemic and the relative lockdown provides us with the experimental basis to argue that the new practice affected both knowledge and beliefs of mathematics teachers and that practice, knowledge, and beliefs form a system. Being part of a system, the reactions to change in practice can be of two types, namely, the system as a whole tries to resist change, or the system as a whole changes — and it changes significantly. The research presented here proposes a model for describing and analyzing what we called a teaching system and examines three cases that help to better depict the systemic nature of teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Rational number knowledge is a crucial feature of primary school mathematics that predicts students’ later mathematics achievement. Many students struggle with the transition from natural number to rational number reasoning, so novel pedagogical approaches to support the development of rational number knowledge are valuable to mathematics educators worldwide. Digital game-based learning environments may support a wide range of mathematics skills. NanoRoboMath, a digital game-based learning environment, was developed to enhance students’ conceptual and adaptive rational number knowledge. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of a preliminary version of the game with fifth and sixth grade primary school students (N = 195) using a quasi-experimental design. A small positive effect of playing the NanoRoboMath game on students’ rational number conceptual knowledge was observed. Students’ overall game performance was related to learning outcomes concerning their adaptive rational number knowledge and understanding of rational number representations and operations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>We used an assessment platform to study the potential of rich student data obtained online to influence classroom instruction and help teachers respond to students’ needs. The article focuses on technology-based formative assessment in the course of teaching a unit on quadrilaterals. We studied example-eliciting tasks, requiring students to determine the truth of a given claim and to use interactive diagrams to construct examples to support their answer. Our aim was to teach the concept of parallelogram by exploring students’ concept images and responding adequately to their submissions. A group of 11-year-old students studied the unit as part of their geometry curriculum. We used an assessment platform, which provides tools designed to monitor examples produced by students interacting with a dynamic geometry environment and to characterize critical and non-critical attributes of the submitted constructions. We present the teaching decisions made by the teacher (the first author), who used automatic feedback on the characteristics of three assessment tasks.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no time constraints.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study is part of the international survey studies on teachers’ beliefs concerning the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning, and this paper reports the findings of the thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses elicited from 287 primary school teachers and teacher trainees in Taiwan. Using the seminal social psychology theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179–211, 1991) to frame the findings, this study highlights 11 perceived barriers and 11 perceived enablers that are thought to influence the teachers’ intention to integrate children’s literature in their mathematics teaching. More specifically, we identified time constraint, lack of pedagogical knowledge and confidence, and resource constraint as being the most-cited perceived barriers, while pedagogical benefits, desire to improve teaching, and enabling social norms were identified as the top perceived enablers. Ultimately, this article offers several recommendations to address some of these key perceived barriers.</p>
