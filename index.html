  Educational Researcher, Volume 50, Issue 5, Page 315-324, June/July 2021. <br>The COVID-19 school closures highlighted the importance of crisis management for school and district leaders. Crisis management, however, has not received sufficient attention from school leadership preparation programs or education leadership researchers. This article synthesizes research spanning schools and other organizations, including those in the private sector, to describe a framework for understanding crises and crisis management in schools and districts and the key competences this literature suggests for successful navigation of crisis situations. We use this framework to discuss leaders’ responses to the COVID-19 school closures in spring 2020. We conclude with an argument for more consciously incorporating crisis management training into both preservice and in-service preparation and support for education leaders and for opening new lines of inquiry into crisis leadership at the school and district levels.

  Abstract
                  <p>In Germany, the Abitur is the highest qualification granted at the end of secondary education after 12 or 13 years of schooling; it provides a general university entrance qualification. Traditionally, written and oral examinations are required to obtain the Abitur. Until 1990, there were mainly decentralized examinations in mathematics in West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany [FRG]), which were taken after 13 school years, and a centralized examination that students took after 12 years of school in East Germany (German Democratic Republic [GDR]). In the unified Germany, examinations are now increasingly set by the 16 individual federal states. This paper has a special focus on changes and permanent features in the written Abitur examination in mathematics in Germany in the context of the social changes caused by the German reunification in 1990. These changes since 1990 are described with regard to the initial situation and framing conditions for the written Abitur examination. Two time periods are considered: (1) the examination situation in the FRG and GDR before 1990 and (2) the changes in the five eastern German federal states (former GDR) under the system change and accession to the FRG after 1990 but before the PISA shock.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports on empirical results about the influence of two different teaching designs on the development of tertiary students’ modelling competency and attitudes towards modelling. A total of 144 first year engineering students were exposed to a diagnostic entrance test, a modelling unit consisting of five lessons with ten tasks, enframed by a pre- and a post-test, and at the end a questionnaire on attitudes towards mathematical modelling. Similar to the German DISUM study, in the modelling unit, one group of participants followed an independence-oriented teaching style, aiming at a balance between students’ independent work and teacher’s guidance, while two other groups were taught according to a more traditional teacher-guided style. Linear mixed regression models were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The results show that all groups had significant learning progress, although there is much room for further improvement, and that the group taught according to the independence-oriented design had the biggest competency growth. In addition, this group exhibited more positive attitudes than the other groups in five of six attitudinal aspects.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This article estimates the relationship between students’ psychosocial and academic outcomes during their first 3 years enrolled at public, 4-year institutions. Our sample comprises students from low-income backgrounds who applied for a competitive scholarship and enrolled at a 4-year public institution. We follow two cohorts of entering students throughout their first 3 years on campus. We observe their cumulative grade point average and persistence decisions each semester, and have annual measures of four psychosocial outcomes: mattering to campus, sense of belonging to campus, academic self-efficacy, and social self-efficacy. We find that psychosocial outcomes are moderately predictive of academic outcomes, with sense of belonging and academic self-efficacy emerging as most predictive of both cumulative grade point avaerage and persistence.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 360-410, June 2021. <br>The Kitagawa–Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition approach has been widely used to attribute group-level differences in an outcome to differences in endowment, coefficients, and their interactions. The method has been implemented for Stata in the popular oaxaca command for cross-sectional analyses. In recent decades, however, research questions have been more often focused on the decomposition of group-based differences in change over time, for example, diverging income trajectories, as well as decomposition of change in differences between groups, for example, change in the gender pay gap over time. We review five existing methods for the decomposition of changes in group means and contribute an extension that takes an interventionist perspective suitable for applications with a clear before–after comparison.These decompositions of levels and changes over time can be implemented using the xtoaxaca command, which works as a postestimation command for different regression commands in Stata. It is built to maximize flexibility in modeling and implements all decomposition techniques presented in this article.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 411-429, June 2021. <br>In empirical work, researchers frequently test hypotheses of parallel form in several regressions, which raises concerns about multiple testing. One way to address the multiple-testing issue is to jointly test the hypotheses (for example, Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt [2019, Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 37: 205–216] and Lee and Lemieux [2010, Journal of Economic Literature 48: 281–355]). While the existing commands suest (Weesie, 1999, Stata Technical Bulletin Reprints 9: 231–248) and mvreg enable Stata users to follow this approach, both are limited in several dimensions. For instance, mvreg assumes homoskedasticity and uncorrelatedness across sampling units, and neither command is designed to be used with panel data. In this article, we introduce the new community-contributed command stackreg, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations and allows for some settings and features that go beyond the capabilities of the existing commands. To achieve this, stackreg runs an ordinary least-squares regression in which the regression equations are stacked as described, for instance, in Wooldridge (2010, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, p. 166–173, MIT Press) and applies cluster–robust variance–covariance estimation.

Specification of a statistical model that can consider the possible dose–response data-generating mechanism, including its variation across studies, is crucial for statistical inference. The aim of this article is to increase the understanding of mixed-effects dose–response models suitable for tables of correlated estimates. One can use the command drmeta with additive (mean difference) and multiplicative (odds ratios, hazard ratios) measures of association. The postestimation command drmeta_graph greatly facilitates the visualization of predicted average and study-specific dose–response relationships. I illustrate applications of the drmeta command with regression splines in experimental and observational data based on nonlinear and random-effects data-generation mechanisms that can be encountered in health-related sciences.

The older command eventstudy provides a comfortable graphical user interface and good functionality for event studies that do not require hypotheses testing. The command estudy, described in Pacicco, Vena, and Venegoni (2018, Stata Journal 18: 461–476; 2021, Stata Journal 21: 141–151), provides a set of commonly applied test statistics and useful exporting routines to spreadsheet software and LATEX for event studies with a limited number of events. The most complete command in terms of available test statistics and benchmark models as well as its ability to handle events with insufficient data, thin trading, and large samples is eventstudy2.

This column is a sequel to those in Stata Journal 10: 670–681 (2010) and 19: 989–1008 (2019). The focus is on what are here called front-and-back plots, in which each subset of data is shown separately with the other subsets as backdrop. The strategy is thus a hybrid of two more common strategies, showing each subset separately (juxtaposing) and showing subsets together (superimposing). A new command, fabplot, is introduced and used in examples.

  Abstract
                  <p>Drawing on Bourdieu’s theory of social and cultural reproduction, this article utilizes the conceptual tools of habitus and cultural capital to examine intergenerational inequalities in attitudes towards mathematics and mathematics learning in three secondary schools in England. Data from 1079 students aged 14–16 included mathematics achievement, survey measures of attitudes towards mathematics, perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, newly developed scales for cultural capital and habitus, and social class. There was a very strong relationship between student’s attitudes towards mathematics and students’ perceptions of their parents’ attitudes towards mathematics. Middle-class students reported more positive attitudes towards mathematics, more positive perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, and had higher mathematics achievement than working-class students. Cultural capital had a significant positive effect on students’ attitudes towards mathematics but a minor effect on their achievement in mathematics. However, cultural capital’s effect on students’ attitudes and achievement in mathematics faded when habitus was included in the model. We suggest that habitus may play a more central role than cultural capital in the reproduction of mathematics inequalities. School quality had a modest but significant impact on mathematics outcomes in this study, so we argue that challenges to mathematics inequalities will require changes both within and outside of mathematics classrooms.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We tested a specific theoretical assumption of a learning trajectories (LTs) approach to curriculum and teaching in the domain of early length measurement. Participating kindergartners (n = 189) were assigned to one of three conditions: LT, reverse-order (REV), or business-as-usual (BAU). LT and REV students received one-on-one instruction using the same activities from a length LT, while the REV condition reversed the LT order. At posttest, LT and REV children exhibited significantly greater learning relative to BAU peers. But importantly, LT children outperformed their REV peers. We conclude that instruction following LTs (i.e., providing instruction just beyond a child’s present level of thinking, progressing through the levels in order as the child advances) may promote more learning than an equivalent amount of instruction using the same activities but that are not theoretically sequenced.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, institutions have responded to changing school populations by preparing teachers for the growing number of emergent bilingual learners (EBLs). But this preparation largely focuses on supporting students’ academic learning and language development, despite enhanced attention to social-emotional well-being in wider educational circles. This comparative case study seeks to understand whether and how teachers are prepared to facilitate this integral component of student learning in five schools with linguistically diverse populations and varied program models to serve EBLs. We first probe how teachers draw from various facets of their preparation to support EBLs’ social-emotional well-being, including teacher education, professional development, collaboration with colleagues, and personal experiences. We then consider teachers’ and students’ perspectives on the requisite expertise to facilitate well-being in classrooms. Findings provide insight for university, district, and school stakeholders seeking to enhance teacher preparation as a means to improve the educational experiences of EBLs.
