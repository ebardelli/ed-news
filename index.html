  Abstract
                  <p>This study is an examination of 79 elementary prospective teachers’ (PSTs’) capacity for recognizing the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems and their difficulties in solving and presenting the process of fraction addition using area, length, and set models. PSTs completed a written task in which they represented the process of solving a set of fraction addition problems of varying complexity in terms of the sizes of the addends, the sums, and the denominators using the three models. The PSTs’ responses to the task were analyzed and clustered to identify the most salient and recurring patterns of erroneous approaches to modeling. While the PSTs recognized the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems, their actual work samples demonstrated several areas for improvement. Some PSTs had invalid answers and representations that were indicative of their misunderstanding of key concepts. Some PSTs had correct answers, but their model did not support sense-making. Additionally, some PSTs’ representations did not clearly incorporate the salient properties of the area, length, and set models. Our analysis generated implications for mathematics teacher educators regarding what PSTs need to learn, develop further, unlearn, and refine in order to effectively teach uses of representation in elementary classroom.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The school discipline literature has expanded rapidly in recent decades, yet the conceptualization and measurement of school discipline patterns remains overlooked. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analytic framework to examine school discipline patterns that encompasses school-level metrics that capture the prevalence and disparity in exclusionary discipline and regression-based approaches that examine the likelihood that students experience exclusionary discipline. We apply the framework to New York City and, based on school-level metrics, find that Black students have the highest prevalence and the highest disproportionality. Results from regression models affirm that Black students are most likely to receive office discipline referrals and suspensions and experience differential processing of suspensions for similar categories of infractions. The findings illustrate the nuances of the disciplinary process in schools and inform the consideration of a range of available analytic tools that educational stakeholders may employ to better measure and understand exclusionary discipline.

  Abstract
                  <p>As an essential community of practice which could facilitate teachers’ professional development and enrich research in teacher education, the teacher–researcher partnership (TRP) has not been sufficiently investigated in China. As reported in this paper, we conducted an empirical study on TRPs between secondary school mathematics teachers and university researchers by applying activity theory to investigate their collaboration and contradictions, through the process of co-designing lesson studies. We found four levels of contradictions, namely, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, within which the fourth one occurs less frequently compared to the other three. To ameliorate or even resolve the contradictions, it requires both sides to (1) achieve agreement on understanding the objects, (2) promote equality in communication and mutual respect, (3) facilitate transformation in identity, and (4) construct a united community. In addition, the investigation provided a depiction of how teachers learn and grow in the TRP as well as how teachers and researchers interact in the partnership, which in turn enriches both teacher education and activity theory.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Existing research examines whether studying with teachers of the same race/ethnicity affects student achievement, but little is known about whether those effects vary by timing and frequency. We use 7 years of administrative data from third through eighth graders in Indiana to estimate the heterogenous links between same race/ethnicity teachers and achievement by school level (i.e., elementary vs. middle schools) and self-contained classroom (i.e., self-contained vs. departmentalized classrooms). We find that the positive links between same race/ethnicity teachers and improved achievement are stronger for elementary school students and students in self-contained classrooms, particularly for Black students. Our findings highlight the importance of timing and frequent exposure to same race/ethnicity teachers in academic trajectories.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Researchers and policymakers use certification as a metric of teaching quality in subject areas as well as subfields of education. We examined the association between having a teacher with dual certification in elementary and special education and math and reading achievement for students with disabilities (SWDs). We also examined whether dual certification related to teachers’ efficacy and job satisfaction. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011, we employed ordinary least square regression models supplemented with school and child fixed effects to examine differences for children with disabilities based on certification type of their teachers in kindergarten, first, and second grades. After controlling for confounding variation at the school and child levels, we find that SWDs with teachers with dual certification score better in math. Results also suggest that teachers with dual certification exhibit more positive dispositions related to teaching SWDs.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Little research in education has focused on school neighborhoods. We employ a novel systematic social observation tool—the internet-based School Neighborhood Assessment Protocol (iSNAP)—within Google Street View to quantify the physical characteristics of 291 preschool communities in nine U.S. cities. We find low to moderate correlations (r = −.03 to −.57) between iSNAP subscales and Census tract poverty, density, and crime, suggesting that the characteristics captured by the iSNAP are related to, yet ultimately distinct from, existing neighborhood structural measures. We find few positive associations between iSNAP community characteristics and 1,230 low-income preschoolers’ end-of-year outcomes. Specifically, resources for outdoor play (e.g., playgrounds, open fields) on school grounds predicted stronger child self-regulation skills, whereas global ratings of safety and care for both the school grounds and surrounding neighborhood predicted stronger approaches to learning skills. Indicators of physical order were not associated with child outcomes.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background and ObjectivesSelecting applications for college admission is critical for university operation and development. This paper leverages machine learning techniques to support enrollment management teams through data-informed decision-making in this otherwise laborious admissions processing.Research Design and MeasuresTwo aspects of university admissions are considered. An ensemble learning approach, through the SuperLearner algorithm, is used to predict student show (yield) rate. The goal is to improve prediction accuracy to minimize over- or under-enrollment. A combinatorial optimization framework is proposed to weigh academic performance and experiential factors for ranking and selecting students for admission. This framework uses simulated annealing, and an efficacy study is presented to evaluate performance.ResultsThe proposed framework is illustrated for selecting an incoming class by optimizing predicted graduation rate and by developing an eligibility index. Each example presents a selection process under potential academic performance and experiential factor targets a university may place on an admitted class. R code is provided for higher education researchers and practitioners to apply the proposed methods in their own settings.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical modelling has been included in many mathematics curricula worldwide, and China’s curricula are no exception. The development of modelling competencies has recently been listed among the Chinese mathematics curriculum’s six key objectives. However, the manner in which nationwide learning and teaching of modelling should be conducted presents a key challenge to China’s schools, most of which are wholly lacking in experience of this practice. In this study we present a thematic analysis of the conceptions of four mathematicians, five mathematics educators and seven mathematics teachers, with regard to the learning and teaching of modelling. The results show that the participants’ views of modelling can be categorised and linked to the following theoretical perspectives of modelling: applied, epistemological, educational, pedagogical and conceptual perspectives. Interestingly, the mathematicians and mathematics educators tended towards the atomistic approach to the learning and teaching of modelling, while the mathematics teachers placed greater emphasis on the holistic approach. The mathematicians and mathematics educators stressed student autonomy, while the teachers emphasised teacher demonstration. All participants considered group work to be an appropriate means of conducting modelling learning and teaching. Additionally, some teachers were concerned that modelling could not be incorporated into mathematical teaching and learning if it could not be included in high-stakes examinations. The paper concludes with a discussion on the rationale behind the existence of the various conceptions and the potential insights that may be drawn from these conceptions.</p>

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 198-228, March 2022. <br>This chapter presents a broad interdisciplinary literature review linking artists’ economic precarity and need for but resistance to entrepreneurial skills, alongside colonial histories, structural racism, and hierarchies of taste in arts organizations. These themes are complemented empirically by engaging data from the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP) to demonstrate indicators of attrition and privilege of arts alumni relative to their participation in the arts workforce. Meaningfully different associations across racial/ethnic groups are uncovered, showing structural exclusion of Black arts alumni in particular, in addition to other intersectional dynamics. This chapter underscores the importance of addressing student debt, the potential of creative pedagogies across the curriculum, and the need for imaginative approaches to renewed public funding of art and artists.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 229-263, March 2022. <br>Creativity is a vital topic of various educational discourses, yet the support it receives within the school system is insufficient. This chapter focuses on four particular ways of making creativity more democratized, salient, and accessible in school settings. We start by exploring the educational benefits of egalitarian theoretical approaches to creativity. Then, we posit that democratization requires an equal focus on the cognitive aspects of creative potential and the motivational sphere of self-perception and self-regulation. Third, analyzing cognitive characteristics, we pay special attention to creative imagery: an understudied yet critical aspect of creative potential. By meta-analyzing available evidence from interventional studies, we show that there are multiple effective approaches to enhancing creative imagery, so—in a sense—supporting creative potential might be democratized as well by going beyond creativity training. Fourth, and finally, we discuss the possibilities of adapting so-called wise interventions for the educational psychology of creativity. We review available evidence of how to strengthen creative confidence and the perceived value of creativity among students, and how to make their creative self-regulation more effective.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 374-397, March 2022. <br>This chapter explores the urgent relevance of posthumanist theory and practice for democratizing creative educational experiences in 21st-century schools, universities, and informal learning environments. Posthumanism challenges the myopic centering of the human in creative education in an age of climate change, artificial intelligence, and zoonotic disease, where nonhuman agencies are intricately imbricated in human cultures and lives. Using a cartographic methodology, the chapter critically maps key theories and debates in posthumanist creativity studies across four substantive fields of inquiry: (a) process philosophy, (b) affect studies, (c) place-based education, and (d) creative ecology. Drawing links between theoretical concepts and practical examples of creative experience across formal and informal education contexts, the chapter scopes an alternative agenda for critical studies of creativity in light of the posthuman turn.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 64-104, March 2022. <br>Black creative educational experiences (BCEEs) are participatory, performative cultural experiences created by or for students, centering Black artistic expression, aesthetics, and engagement. Using African-centered frameworks, we provide a methodological guide for examining BCEEs in education research, which includes centering Black “ways of knowing,” validating creative expressions cultivated by and for Black people, acknowledging the influence of Black creative expression on research and practice, considering researcher positionalities as observers and cultivators of Black creative expression, and viewing Black creative expression as knowledge production. We found BCEEs are democratizing educational experiences rooted in intellectual and expressive freedom (freedom of movement/voice/tongue), and community building. BCEEs should be centered in education research, particularly postsecondary education, and prioritized in institutional programming, curricula, and high-impact practices.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 345-373, March 2022. <br>In this review of literature, we attend to some of the ways that well-intentioned hopes for fostering creativity and encouraging greater inclusion may also rely on problematic premises that work to reify exclusionary logics and practices. More specifically, we historicize and critically examine how creativity studies—often despite explicit efforts to broaden notions of creativity, include marginalized populations, and democratize education—have differently reanimated racializing and ableizing discourses over seven decades of efforts to scientifically study, define, and/or cultivate creativity. In our emphasis on the relationship between past and present designs, we attend to more pernicious tensions and concerns that continue to hold implications for scholarship, research, policy, and practice.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 264-287, March 2022. <br>This review brings together scholarship from creative educational experiences (CEE) and connected learning to describe a connected arts learning framework, reframing arts education in the 21st century with a focus on connecting youths’ interest-driven art making to opportunities through supportive relationships. Such a framework pushes the arts education field to consider outcomes beyond artistic skill acquisition and academic achievement to include a broader range of opportunities, including those civic- and career-related; promote interest development through targeted exposure to new forms of art making; create and implement professional development and programming to emphasize networks and connections; and draw from culturally sustaining practices to bridge connections between spaces for learning. A connected learning lens applied to what we know about high quality arts education sharpens our focus on how CEE can cultivate equity and social/cultural connection for youth.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 166-197, March 2022. <br>The movement from STEM to STEAM, with its emphasis on real-world applications, promises to meet the changing needs of a globally connected world. However, the potential of transdisciplinarity to inspire and deepen our understanding of who we are and how we make sense of a world in turmoil remains undertheorized. This article makes a case for repositioning STEAM education as democratized enactments of transdisciplinary education, where arts and sciences are not separate or even separable endeavors. Drawing upon posthumanist theorizing, three projects will exemplify transdisciplinarity across music, mathematics, and science education. Transgressing and transcending disciplinary boundaries, and attending to both human and nonhuman perspectives, we invite a rethink of the work of schools, going beyond democratizing creativity to fully enact posthumanist transdisciplinarity.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 105-133, March 2022. <br>In response to the special issue on democratizing creative educational experiences (CEE), we conducted a thematic analysis of recent scholarship on creativity and decolonization (2010–2021) and analyzed recurring tensions across literature grounded in Indigenous, Black, feminist, and non-western epistemological perspectives on creativity. We found themes that are not new but are yet to be taken up consistently and credibly in western creativity and education research and practice. For instance, spirituality emerges as a valuable ingredient for creativity, body as inseparable from the mind, dialectic resistance and resilience as acts of creative existence, and non-human agency as essential to the creative process. Informed by these themes, we share implications for research and practice, seeking new spaces inclusive of historically ignored onto-epistemologies.

  Review of Research in Education, Volume 46, Issue 1, Page 288-323, March 2022. <br>This chapter provides a systematic, synthesizing, and critical review of the literature related to assessments of creativity in education from historical, theoretical, empirical, and practical standpoints. We examined the assessments used in the articles focusing on education that are published from January 2010 to May 2021 in eight creativity, psychological, and educational journals. We found that the assessments of creativity in education are split between psychological and education research and have increased international participation. Additionally, these assessments are more general than specific and focus more on cognitive than noncognitive aspects. Like previous reviews of assessments of creativity in general, this review showed that creativity in education is still mainly assessed by divergent thinking or creativity tests, self-report questionnaires, and product-based subjective techniques. We analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and highlighted many innovations in the assessment. We further discussed how the major assessment approaches address race, ethnicity, class, and gender issues in education. We concluded the review with recommendations for how to better assess creativity in education and how assessments of creativity in education contribute to our understanding of the creative educational experience and democratizing education.
