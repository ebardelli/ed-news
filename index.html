  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP; e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1995) is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to serve culturally and linguistically diverse student learners. Although a large body of work describes its tenets and permutations, and its implications for students, less work has been done to outline the myriad barriers that teachers face when trying to implement CRP. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a race-conscious, multilevel, ecological framework to illuminate the societal, institutional, and individual obstacles that teachers must navigate in the pursuit of CRP. Implications for teacher training and development are discussed.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Differential item functioning (DIF) occurs when the probability of endorsing an item differs across groups for individuals with the same latent trait level. The presence of DIF items may jeopardize the validity of an instrument; therefore, it is crucial to identify DIF items in routine operations of educational assessment. While DIF detection procedures based on item response theory (IRT) have been widely used, a majority of IRT-based DIF tests assume predefined anchor (i.e., DIF-free) items. Not only is this assumption strong, but violations to it may also lead to erroneous inferences, for example, an inflated Type I error rate. We propose a general framework to define the effect sizes of DIF without a priori knowledge of anchor items. In particular, we quantify DIF by item-specific residuals from a regression model fitted to the true item parameters in respective groups. Moreover, the null distribution of the proposed test statistic using robust estimator can be derived analytically or approximated numerically even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, which yields asymptotically justified statistical inference. The Type I error rate and the power performance of the proposed procedure are evaluated and compared with the conventional likelihood-ratio DIF tests in a Monte Carlo experiment. Our simulation study has shown promising results in controlling Type I error rate and power of detecting DIF items. Even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, the true and false alarm rate can be well controlled when a robust regression estimator is used.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>New York City’s school system is among the most diverse and segregated in the United States. Using difference-in-differences and placebo tests, we evaluate two desegregation policies in two geographic districts in New York City, District 3 and District 15. Both districts attempted to lower economic segregation within their district while maintaining school choice, prioritizing economically disadvantaged students for middle school seats in advance of the 2019–2020 school year. District 15, however, set more ambitious prioritization targets and also chose to eliminate academic screens from all middle schools. We find that District 15’s policy lowered economic segregation in sixth grade by 55% and racial segregation by 38%, while District 3’s policy led to no significant change in segregation.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study forms part of a classroom teaching experiment on the development of a group of 25 9–10 years old students’ algebraic thinking. More specifically, it explored their reasoning while solving word problems built around functional relationships to determine how they generalized through questions posed using natural language, drawn figures or the keyword ‘many’. Their written and oral answers to those questions were analyzed qualitatively to determine which approach most effectively supported the expression of their generalization. The results reveal the benefits of posing questions about the general case in different ways while teaching students to use conventional algebraic representations. According to these findings, representing indeterminate quantities with the keyword ‘many’ induces generalization more successfully than representing them with letters. The use of letters prompts students to seek meaning for the letters, either conventionally, as an unknown or variable quantity, or otherwise, as a label or specific values assigned according to their own criteria. Identifying the most effective procedures may help teachers and curriculum designers formulate mathematical tasks that encourage students to express the generality they perceive in particular cases. Determining the communication demands of each approach is likewise highly useful.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Mentoring is an essential fixture of teacher education. With growing opportunities for international learning exchanges, there is a need to better understand how cross-cultural mentoring can be characterized by reciprocal learning. This study investigated mentee perceptions of the mentoring relationship in an international, cross-cultural teacher education exchange. We conducted research among 19 Chinese preservice teachers who participated in an international teacher education exchange program, exploring their perspectives on the cross-cultural mentoring relationship and mutual learning. Our findings suggest that learning outcomes are improved in a mentoring relationship when there are strong relational ties, opportunities for reciprocal learning, and a greater awareness of cultural complexity. We contend that there is value in supporting the mentoring relationship directly, which has implications for both international exchanges and teacher education programs.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Bounded continuous data are encountered in many applications of item response theory, including the measurement of mood, personality, and response times and in the analyses of summed item scores. Although different item response theory models exist to analyze such bounded continuous data, most models assume the data to be in an open interval and cannot accommodate data in a closed interval. As a result, ad hoc transformations are needed to prevent scores on the bounds of the observed variables. To motivate the present study, we demonstrate in real and simulated data that this practice of fitting open interval models to closed interval data can majorly affect parameter estimates even in cases with only 5% of the responses on one of the bounds of the observed variables. To address this problem, we propose a zero and one inflated item response theory modeling framework for bounded continuous responses in the closed interval. We illustrate how four existing models for bounded responses from the literature can be accommodated in the framework. The resulting zero and one inflated item response theory models are studied in a simulation study and a real data application to investigate parameter recovery, model fit, and the consequences of fitting the incorrect distribution to the data. We find that neglecting the bounded nature of the data biases parameters and that misspecification of the exact distribution may affect the results depending on the data generating model.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>How do teachers account for homework-related inequalities? Our longitudinal ethnographic study reveals that, despite awareness of structural inequalities in their students’ lives, elementary- and middle-school teachers’ practices centered the myth of meritocracy. They treat struggles with math homework as products of students’ and (particularly in elementary grades) parents’ insufficient responsibility, effort, and motivation. These interpretations then justify homework practices that reinforce inequalities, including assigning homework that exceeds what students can complete independently and rewarding/punishing students based on homework. We discuss implications for debates about homework and the dangers of meritocracy myths and offer recommendations for more equitable alternatives.

  Abstract
                  <p>Students’ attitudes can be influential in the emotions experienced in mathematics learning and achievement at school. Two important judgements, according to Control-Value Theory are degree of control a student has over, and the value attached to, learning activities or outcomes. Appraisals of control and value are believed to play a central role in the emotions experienced when learning, and subsequent achievement. Achievement, in turn, can strengthen or weaken control-value appraisals. In the present study we set out to examine the bidirectional relations between control-value appraisals and a key emotion experienced in the mathematics classroom, namely anxiety. In addition, we tested the proposition that control-value appraisals are indirectly linked to achievement, mediated by classroom-related anxiety. The participants were 1242 Year 5 students (49% female), with a mean of 9.3 years, from 24 English primary schools. Self-report data for anxiety, and control-value appraisals, were collected over two waves (separated by seven months) and mathematics achievement collected from a classroom test one week later. Results from a structural equation model showed bidirectional relations between higher anxiety and lower control. Although anxiety predicted lower value, value was unrelated to subsequent anxiety. Higher control at the first wave of measurement was related to higher mathematics achievement, mediated by lower anxiety, at the second wave. These results underscore the importance of reducing anxiety when learning mathematics and suggest that intervention could achieve this outcome by reducing anxiety directly or by strengthening control.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Lockwood has argued that taking a set-oriented perspective is critical for successful combinatorial enumeration. To date, however, the research literature has not yet captured the cognitive processes involved in taking such a perspective. In this theoretical paper, we elaborate the constructs of spatial structuring and spatial-numerical linked structuring from within our constructivist theoretical perspective to provide a cognitive account of how students conceptualize and generate combinatorial composites. Our elaborations emerged from analyzing and reflecting on data from two constructivist teaching experiments examining undergraduate students’ combinatorial concepts, mental actions, and strategies. We define multiple constructs in our theoretical approach, including spatial-temporal-enactive (or S*-) structuring, two specific forms of S*-structuring (intra-composite and inter-composite structuring), numerical structuring, and S*-numerical linked structuring. We then illustrate how our framework can be used to analyze students’ physical/mental actions and operations when engaging in combinatorial inquiry. Critically, our findings suggest that successful and meaningful combinatorial enumeration depends on constructing intra-composite S*-structuring for single combinatorial composites, then abstracting, reflecting on, generalizing, and linking this intra-composite structuring to an inter-composite structuring to generate the set of combinatorial composites. We conclude with a discussion of how our paper contributes to existing research on combinatorial reasoning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Discrete mathematics brings interesting problems for teaching and learning proof, with accessible objects such as integers (arithmetic), graphs (modeling, order) or polyominoes (geometry). Many problems that are still open can be explained to a large public. The objects can be manipulated by simple dynamic operations (removing, adding, ‘gluing’, contracting, splitting, decomposing, etc.). All these operations can be seen as tools for proving. In this paper we particularly explore the field of ‘discrete optimization’. A theoretical background is defined by taking two main axes into account, namely, the epistemological analysis of discrete problems studied by contemporary researchers in discrete optimization and the design of adidactical situations for classrooms in the frame of the Theory of Didactical Situations. Two problems coming from ongoing research in discrete optimization (the Pentamino Exclusion and the Eight Queens problems) are developed and transposed for the classroom. They underscore the learning potentialities of discrete mathematics and epistemological obstacles concerning proving processes. They emphasize the understanding of a necessary condition and a sufficient condition and problematize the difference between optimal and optimum. They provide proofs involving partitioning strategies, greedy algorithms but also primal–dual methods leading to the concept of duality. The way such problems can be implemented in the classroom is described in a collaborative study by mathematicians and mathematics education researchers (Maths à Modeler Research Federation) through the Research Situations for the Classroom project.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Self-efficacy in mathematics is related to engagement, persistence, and academic performance. Prior research focused mostly on examining changes to students’ self-efficacy across large time intervals (months or years), and paid less attention to changes at the level of lesson sequences. Knowledge of how self-efficacy changes during a sequence of lessons is important as it can help teachers better support students’ self-efficacy in their everyday work. In this paper, we expanded previous studies by investigating changes in students’ self-efficacy across a sequence of 3–4 lessons when students were learning a new topic in mathematics (nStudents = 170, nTime-points = 596). Nine classes of Norwegian grade 6 (n = 77) and grade 10 students (n = 93) reported their self-efficacy for easy, medium difficulty, and hard tasks. Using multilevel models for change, we found (a) change of students’ self-efficacy across lesson sequences, (b) differences in the starting point and change of students’ self-efficacy according to perceived task difficulty and grade, (c) more individual variation of self-efficacy starting point and change in association with harder tasks, and (d) students in classes who were taught a new topic in geometry had stronger self-efficacy at the beginning of the first lesson as compared to those who were taught a new topic in algebra (grade 10), and students in classes who were taught a new topic in fractions had steeper growth across the lesson sequence as compared to those who were taught a new topic in measurement (grade 6). Implications for both research and practice on how new mathematics topics are introduced to students are discussed.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>From a teacher’s perspective, teacher learning happens through a complex web of learning experiences. However, research on teacher professional development (PD) typically focuses on the direct influence of single activities or programs. PD researchers less often acknowledge the interactive impacts on teacher learning of the multiple experiences teachers have in different contexts. This conceptual paper works toward a more thoroughgoing ecological framing of teacher PD by bringing forth three dimensions of teacher learning that are often overlooked: scope, interconnectedness, and temporality. The essay centers on the type of design that is widely considered high-quality PD—namely, experiences that are collaborative and situated in teachers’ instructional context—and considers those experiences from the perspective of these three dimensions. I illustrate this framework and its affordances with data from a 4-year research project rooted in video-based mathematics teacher conversations. The focus on scope allows researchers to name and distinguish contexts that are salient to their different studies. The focus on interconnectedness uncovers the interactive relationship between the immediate and broader PD contexts. Finally, the focus on temporality affords the understanding of different phases in learning and extends linear conceptions of progress. Together, these dimensions provide a rich conceptualization to better inform the work of teacher educators.

We interviewed 19 preservice teacher candidates and report on their experiences when selecting their university of choice, the barriers they faced, and the supports they received. Participants reported coming to their university because of cost, location, and reputation. They reported common barriers such as inability to work, caring for children, and lack of support or access to other resources. However, participants reported professors and external funding as the major factors that had helped them succeed. Implications about this diverse group of students are discussed.

Using data from North Carolina, we find that candidates earn higher edTPA scores if they student-taught in a high value-added school and with a cooperating teacher earning higher evaluation ratings. Evidence also suggests that candidates earn higher scores when they are mentored by a cooperating teacher who is more familiar with performance assessments. Finally, we find that the relationships between student teaching environments and edTPA scores vary by characteristics of the candidate. This study reinforces prior work on the importance of learning environments to teacher development and the importance of preparation programs securing placements in high-quality learning environments. Our results may also have implications for the use of performance assessments by states and preparation programs.

Participants placed more trust in experiential knowledge sources compared with formalized sources and participants’ beliefs about sources of teaching knowledge generally predicted their motivation to learn from different sources. Quantitative results were further supported and elaborated by qualitative interview data that suggested development of preservice teachers’ beliefs about sources of teaching knowledge and their understanding of the relation between theoretical and practical knowledge over time. The findings extend existing literature by providing a window on how (preservice) teachers may articulate their views about sources of teaching knowledge and relations between theory and practice, with expected consequences for teaching practice. Implications for teacher educators’ practice are also discussed.

In the current study, we shed light on middle grades social studies teaching and learning—a black hole of research in the subject area. Using data from the National Assessment for Education Progress (NAEP) eighth grade U.S. history assessment, we explore the intersections of eighth grade social studies teachers’ teacher education pathways, instructional, decision-making, and curricular structure on students’ knowledge of history. Results suggest that teachers identified as having a social studies-inclusive teacher education background and who only teach social studies (as opposed to multiple subjects) were associated with higher average student performance on the NAEP exam. Findings have implications for middle grades social studies teacher education and how the subject is organized within middle schools.
