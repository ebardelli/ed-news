  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many selective colleges consider the backgrounds of applicants to improve equity in admissions. However, this information is usually not available for all applicants. We examine whether the chances of admission and enrollment changed after 43 colleges gained access to a new tool that standardizes information on educational disadvantage for all applicants. Applicants from the most challenging school and neighborhood backgrounds experienced a 5-percentage point increase in the probability of admission in the year of adoption relative to similar applicants in the previous year. The tool did not alter the probability of enrollment as a function of applicant challenge level in the full sample, but positive changes are concentrated among applicants to institutions that used the tool to allocate financial aid.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics Challenge for Young Australians is a unique enrichment program that has been produced annually by the Australian Mathematics Trust since 1991. In its present form, it is divided into four levels and caters for talented students from years 3 to 10. In a typical year, it attracts over 15,000 entries. Individual schools arrange a period of up to four weeks in the first half of the academic year for students to work on their prescribed set of the problems and write full solutions. Limited collaboration among students is permitted and encouraged. There is a strong emphasis on articulating clearly the reasoning in solutions with sound and complete presentation. A guide containing marking schemes is provided for teachers to help them assess their students' work. It also includes discussion points and extension questions, which are relevant to each problem and may be used by the teacher for further enrichment activity. This paper discusses the history, aims, and structure of the program. It describes how problems are designed by the Challenge Committee to engage the students and develop their problem-solving skills. A range of past Challenge problems are presented to illustrate their construction, diversity, levels of difficulty, and relevance to educational objectives.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate seventh-grade students’ visuospatial thinking processes in an art studio environment, where students were engaged with geometrically rich artworks. The students were asked to observe minimalist artworks, then create and critique their own and others’ artworks based on the Studio Thinking Framework. Data were collected through interviews conducted with students, video recordings in the studio, and students’ documents (sketches, artworks, and notes). The data were analyzed based on previous studies on spatial thinking and emergent data. The study’s findings indicate that the Studio Thinking-based environment has the potential to elicit students’ visuospatial thinking processes, mainly in recognizing shapes, decomposing and composing shapes, patterning, and transforming shapes rigidly and non-rigidly (scaling). The present study, which includes accounts of three studio works, suggests an emergent framework for the characterization of visuospatial thinking within a particular art-math-related environment. The findings of the study shed light on other studies on visual arts and mathematics education and on mathematical thinking and learning in informal learning settings.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes an embedded case study of “blended” teaching integrated with traditional lessons in a Student-Centered Active Learning Environment and social activities on the platform. The didactic phenomena were designed by creating learning environments, artifacts, and teaching/learning sequences in authentic educational contexts. We aim at improving the task design of a mathematics lesson with an impact on students’ performance in mathematics. Quantitative results show considerable benefits in the evolution of the use and coordination of several systems of semiotic representation. As a result, a better predisposition to the study of the subject seems to appear; moreover, the satisfaction test shows the achievement of alternative teaching methodologies for most of the students.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Colleges and universities have increasingly worried in recent decades about college students’ well-being, with the COVID-19 pandemic aggravating these concerns. Our study examines changes to undergraduate emotional sentiments and psychological well-being from before to after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we explore whether certain risk factors (i.e., prior mental health impairments, trait emotional stability) and protective factors (i.e., subjective socioeconomic status, parental education, household resources) predicted students’ emotions and their intraindividual changes due to the pandemic onset. We compared experience sampling method data from 120 students from before and after the pandemic onset, examining intraindividual trajectories. There was only little change in students’ emotions. Prior mental health impairment and trait emotional stability predicted students’ emotions, averaged across time points, but not emotion changes. Few associations with emotions were found for subjective socioeconomic status and parental education, but study-related household resources predicted levels and changes in emotions.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, a growing number of studies have applied regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) to the analysis of prominent regional economic development and business incentive policies. As a result, impact evaluations of these policy interventions are being increasingly commissioned under the assumption that local linear regressions have superior impact identification properties in the cases in which an eligibility boundary, geographical border or application cutoff is identifiable as a source of treatment assignment. This paper shows that in a number of frequently encountered cases, however, economic development and business incentive programs pose peculiar impact identification conditions in terms of violations of main assumptions for the validity of RDDs and of running variables that have little or no influence of the outcome variable. Under these circumstances, that bear generalizable relevance also for the analysis of other public programs at large, no adequate testing to support the internal validity of the applied discontinuity design is often performed in the literature and the use of local linear/polynomial regressions, or cross-border comparisons, becomes an inadequate choice. When these conditions apply, adopting instead other quasi-experimental methods to achieve an actual adequate treatment-control balance of the relevant baseline characteristic will often be a better approach.JEL classification; O1; R5; C23

  Abstract
                  <p>In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created by the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18 million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals are distributed to public school students. In the following year these students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of boys. This distinction is accentuated with the age of the students and in the grades of students in the upper percentiles of the exam.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling, along with the educational discourse surrounding these, have many connections. However, ways that the educational discourse on discrete mathematics can benefit from the inclusion of examples of mathematical modelling and the accompanying discussion are currently under-researched. In this paper, we elaborate on the educational potential of examples of mathematical modelling based on the usage of methods from discrete mathematics, with a focus on secondary education. We first describe vertex-edge graphs as possible topics of discrete mathematics that are accessible at school level within modelling lessons. Secondly, in the context of a case study, we describe modelling activities with students at the end of lower-secondary education, using a classical problem of discrete mathematics originating from the Königsberg bridge problem. The students’ solution processes for this optimisation problem based on graph theory are described. Their approaches are examined referring to the phases of the modelling cycle, using the method of qualitative content analysis. We studied in particular the extent to which students use concepts related to vertex-edge graphs in specific sub-phases of the modelling process. The analysis allows the required sub-competences of modelling to be identified and the connection of these competences with discrete mathematics to be worked out. On the basis of this analysis, educational opportunities of teaching discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling are assessed. Overall, we point out the possibilities and opportunities for using examples from the field of discrete mathematics to acquire modelling competences and to foster the linkage of mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics at school level.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past several decades, housing costs have risen sharply, and as a result, an increasing number of families have become “housing cost burdened,” paying more than one third of their income toward rent and utilities. This integrative literature synthesis considers the known and potential impacts of families’ housing affordability problems on child development and schooling outcomes through a review of 64 studies published between 2000 and 2020. The synthesis proceeds in three sections: the first section examines research on the direct connection between affordability and child outcomes. The second section considers the empirical evidence on four pathways through which affordability problems are theorized to affect child outcomes: the residential mobility pathway (by causing residential mobility, school mobility, eviction, or homelessness), the living environment pathway (by reducing the quality of housing or living conditions), the neighborhood and school opportunity pathway (by restricting access to high-opportunity neighborhoods and schools), and the parental resources pathway (by reducing financial resources that could be invested in children and increasing parental stress). The third section of the synthesis considers affordability’s impact on children through an examination of the research literature on the impact of federal housing assistance. Future directions for policy are considered, including the expansion of housing assistance for families, and additional research is urged on the impacts of housing affordability on children by scholars within the field of education.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The objective of this study is to measure the effects of state aid distributed to private enterprises in North Macedonia on the enterprises’ efficiency. We examine the governmental Plan for Economic Growth (PEG) pursued through the Financial Support of Investment Law (FSIL) and the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development (FITD). We rely on a rigorous impact evaluation method, whereby comparison groups are sourced from the pool of rejected applicants for the two programs. We pursue conditional matching on firms’ observables and then apply the difference-in-differences method to isolate the effect of the subsidy. FSIL State Aid showed largely ineffective, with producing hardly any difference in sales, investment, wages, or profits among recipients, except employment. These results demonstrate the absence of the incentive effect as it relates to FSIL state aid. On the other hand, the FITD State Aid showed to be considerably effective, as the recipients were found to have increased their sales revenue and their investment in technology and profits, corroborating the presence of the incentive effect as it relates to FITD state aid. Notwithstanding the legitimacy of the policy objective to equalize domestic and foreign firms in terms of their access to state aid, these findings document partial failure of the PEG to do so due to its structural problems.JEL classification: H25, C90

  Action Research, Volume 20, Issue 1, Page 10-26, March 2022. <br>This article explores how imaginal knowing can contribute to learning and action research. I relate this to a need for organizations to learn differently for bringing sustainable results that nourish the world. I position imaginal knowing as a reflexive way of being, which informs awareness beyond language and discourse. An arts-based researcher, my paintings are imaginal reflections of lived experience. I found how engaging with the imaginal enables a more profound presence with that experience. This process, which I refer to as growth-in-connection, can generate unexpected insights and learning. For me, artistically expressing imagination became a reflexive practice to deepen understanding and voice. This article consists of a practice-based strand where I share drawings, paintings, and an inquiry into client work. In the other strand, I explore theoretical ideas from Art-Based Method, Critical thinking, Reflexivity and Action Research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Proof by mathematical induction poses a persistent challenge for students enrolled in proofs-based mathematics courses. Prior research indicates a number of related factors that contribute to the challenge, and suggests fruitful instructional approaches to support students in meeting that challenge. In particular, researchers have suggested quasi-induction as an intuitive approach to understanding the role of the inductive implication. However, a cognitive gap remains in transitioning to formal proof by induction. The gap includes the cognitive demand of quantification and the danger of inadvertently assuming what one is trying to prove. Informed by prior research, we designed instruction that builds from students’ conceptualizations of logical implication, utilizes quasi-induction, and introduces a novel set of tasks designed to bridge the gap that remains. We studied this research-based instructional design within two sections of an Introduction to Proofs course at a large public four-year university in the southeastern United States. Our findings, presented as themes, bring together extant literature and highlight nuances not previously reported, particularly regarding reasons students appear to conflate the assumption of the statement to be proved with the assumption of the inductive hypothesis. For instance, quantification of the inductive implication and the inductive assumption require careful use of language, using terms that may seem ambiguous to students, outside of mathematical convention. We conclude with a discussion of links between the Principle of Universal Generalization and mathematical induction.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study the research was focused on the mechanisms of how Chinese in-service teachers’ beliefs about mathematics, together with their professional knowledge, affect their teaching approaches. With a quantitative survey study involving 92 in-service teachers, it identified six types of teachers with three different categories of beliefs (i.e., Instrumentalist, Platonist, and Problem-solving oriented) and two different levels (i.e., strong and limited) of subject knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge on the topic of functions. Six teachers were subsequently selected, for a detailed analysis of how the teachers’ beliefs and knowledge influenced their teaching practices. The case study results showed that teachers with different professional knowledge levels about functions and beliefs about mathematics had different teaching focuses and showed different teaching approaches. Three teaching approaches were identified, including the performance-focused content-centered approach, the understanding-focused content-centered approach, and the thinking-focused student-centered approach.</p>
