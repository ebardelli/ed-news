  Abstract
                  <p>Our research aimed to investigate the potential learning benefits to young children of implementing digital interactive multimodal technologies that provide both visual and haptic experiences in elementary mathematics classrooms. We studied the ways in which fourth-grade students collaboratively create collective strategies for solving mathematical problems utilizing dynamic geometry software with multi-touch interfaces, a combination we call a multi-touch Dynamic Geometry Environment. We examine in-depth two case studies each illustrating how mathematical strategies, collaboration, and socially mediated metacognition emerge in the small groups of children while working on an activity using the Geometer’s Sketchpad® on the iPad to make sense of an intuitive idea of covariation. We found that children’s interactions with their peers, the interviewer, and the mDGE favored the emergence of varied collaborative behaviors and socially mediated metacognitive processes that fostered the co-construction and development of mathematical strategies over a short period of time.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Technological innovation and its paradigm, that is, the Fourth Industrial Revolution-4IR, have shown strong impact on income levels of adopters across the globe. To this end, this analysis examines the impact of bank funding and institutional quality on technological advancement. Objectives: This study adds additional variables such as high-technology exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) as control variable. Our study period spans from 2000 to 2018 on an annual frequency for E7 economies (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, India, Turkey, Russia, and China). Research Design: This study leverages on cross-sectional ARDL, Augmented Mean Group (AMG), and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group Estimates (CCEMG) estimation techniques to examine long-run relationship between the outlined variables. Subjects: Empirical findings show that institution quality, bank finance, income, high-technology exports, and foreign direct investments exert a positive effect on advancements in technology. Furthermore, the interaction between bank finance and institution quality on technological advancement is also positive and statistically significant. Based on the findings, it is concluded that large-scale funding is crucial for businesses to leverage revolutionary technology. Likewise, access to large capital sources if made easier encourages technology affordance as well as innovation and operational excellence. Thus, economies with established legal and financial systems stand to offer businesses such security, which encourages business innovation. Conclusions: Consequently, E7 economies ought to improve their financial and legal systems to boost financial security, creativity, and competitiveness of businesses.

  Abstract
                  <p>Despite the challenges that primary historical sources present for students and instructors alike, engaging students with such sources as part of their mathematical learning experiences is an increasingly common instructional practice. Yet research on teaching and learning with primary sources remains a niche activity. It is thus reasonable to ask whether the use of primary sources merits broader attention from the mathematics education community. This article explores this question through the lens of Sfard’s commognitive theory of learning, which views mathematics as a discourse and mathematical learning as the process of becoming a participant in that discourse. Importantly, commognitive tenets apply to interpretations of mathematical development at both the historical and individual levels. I use these tenets to analyze a particular type of student project that adopts a guided reading approach to primary sources. Specifically, I examine examples of such projects that have been developed and used in the US to teach core mathematical topics at the university level since 2003, using commognitive theory to characterize the potential learning opportunities they afford. As with all instructional materials, these opportunities can be missed in classroom implementation. Nevertheless, the discourses represented in different instructional materials render some learning opportunities easier to offer students, while constraining the possibility of others. I thus also briefly examine some of the differences between these primary source projects and the standard textbooks that they are intended to replace.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, drawing on the philosophy of dialectical materialism, we present an elaboration of two concepts that tend to remain backstage in debates in the field of history in mathematics education, namely, the concept of mathematics learning and the concept of classroom mathematics knowledge. The elaboration of these two concepts makes room to return to the longstanding question of the role of history in mathematics education. We argue that the history of mathematics in education is not a choice but a need—a central part of the process of understanding our human nature as essentially historical and cultural. We illustrate these ideas through the analysis of the encounter of a group of prospective teachers with a 14th century problem about motion. In this encounter the students engaged critically in conversations with voices of the past, while restoring the aesthetic, ethical, and historical dimensions of knowing and learning.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The transition to fully or partially online instruction for K–12 students necessitated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the current lack of understanding of practices that support K–12 student learning in online settings in emergency situations but also, more troublingly, in K–12 online teaching and learning more generally. A systematic review of literature regarding K–12 online teaching and learning in the United States was therefore conducted to begin to fill this gap and to inform the work of policy makers, researchers, teacher educators, teachers, and administrators as they negotiate the changing role of online instruction in our nation’s educational systems. The review revealed a set of contextual conditions that are foundational to student learning in K–12 online settings (prepared educators, technology access and autonomy, students’ developmental needs and abilities, and students’ self-regulated learning skills). The literature also pointed to seven pillars of instructional practice that support student learning in these settings (evidence-based course organization and design, connected learners, accessibility, supportive learning environment, individualization, active learning, and real-time assessment).

  Abstract
                  <p>While reports of teachers’ use of curriculum materials are common, that of teachers as designers of their own materials are far less so. We argue that these (rare) instructional materials, defined as materials that are classroom-ready and that carry the teachers’ actual instructional goals, are ‘objects’ that are suitable as records of teachers’ planning and learning when developed alongside professional development. We provide supporting evidence of this claim and unpack the complexities of interacting instructional goals through a case study of a teacher who (re-)designed her own instructional materials as she participated in professional development. From the findings of the case, we reflect on the educational and methodological implications of pursing this research approach.

  Abstract
                  <p>According to expectancy-value models, two important motivational constructs are task value and self-efficacy expectations. As students work intensively on mathematical problems in the classroom, teachers need the competence to judge whether students value solving the problem and how confident they are that they will succeed. However, not much is known about the mechanisms behind teachers’ judgments concerning students’ motivation. The goal of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (a) How do preservice teachers rate their own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (b) Are there differences in preservice teachers’ diagnostic judgments concerning school students’ task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (c) Do preservice teachers’ own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems differ from preservice teachers’ judgments of school students’ task value and self-efficacy? A total of 182 preservice teachers were asked about the value of 12 problems, their confidence in solving the problems, and how hypothetical ninth graders would judge these constructs. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own perceptions regarding both constructs were lower for modelling problems than for other problems. When judging school students’ motivation, ratings of both constructs were higher for word problems. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own motivation were significantly higher across all types of problems than their judgments of school students’ perspectives. A positive correlation between preservice teachers’ own motivation and their judgments of school students’ motivation indicates the importance of teachers’ perceptions of their own motivation to solve mathematical problems for diagnostic judgments.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role and scope of historical knowledge in work on using history of mathematics in education. This work can come from three types of actors, namely, teachers, teacher trainers, and educational researchers. The texts written by these actors show that their objectives and practices can be different, as is the historical knowledge they deploy. We can read writings of teachers who seek to ‘give meaning’ to school knowledge, by integrating original texts into their teaching progression. We also can read writings of educational researchers who prepare ‘history capsules’ for teachers, which can be introduced into teaching from time to time. To carry out this research, I focus on analyzing the complex relationships between the following three poles: objectives, pedagogical practices, and historical knowledge. To this end, I use the notion of ideal types introduced and developed by the sociologist Max Weber. Section 1 is devoted to the construction of ideal types corresponding to my aim. Based on these ideal types, in Sect. 2, I elaborate on the role and scope of historical knowledge in concrete situations where the history of mathematics is used; specifically, on the one hand during the reading of original texts in an educational context, and on the other hand, in the particular context of teachers education. Some further comments are made in the third and last section.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we document the support provided by highly recognised journals in Mathematics Education in response to the challenges faced by English non-dominant language (EnDL) authors when they attempt to publish in English. To address this issue, we first conducted a synthesis of research literature related to those influences that direct EnDL authors’ publication efforts towards English language journals and the associated challenges that result. Second, we gathered survey and interview data from participant editors-in-chief of leading journals in Mathematics Education about the support, enacted and planned, provided by their journal for EnDL authors and associated challenges. Finally, we discuss the findings of the study from the perspective of heteroglossia. Findings indicate that while a range of initiatives have been employed to support EnDL authors, current journal policies lag somewhat behind the plans of editors-in-chief, which have been limited, to date, by available resources.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China, all school classes were delivered through an online environment from February 24 to May 22, 2020. To support this transition, the Shanghai Education Commission led expert teachers and specialists to develop a series of online video lessons based on the Shanghai unified curriculum, and suggested students watch the online video lessons individually from home, followed by an online synchronous lesson supported by class teachers. This study investigated what primary mathematics teachers learned from addressing these challenges through a case study. By following two purposefully selected teachers over 2 weeks during the transition, multiple data sets including online video lessons, online synchronous lessons, daily reflections, and post-online teacher interviews were collected. A fine-grained analysis of the data from the lens of the documentational approach to didactics found that teachers adaptively used online video lessons as important resources for their online synchronous lessons and virtual Teaching Research Groups as a teachers’ collaboration mechanism supported them to develop online video lessons and address various technological constraints. Finally, implications of this case study for mathematics education globally are discussed.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The Every Student Succeeds Act builds on prior efforts to bridge the gap between research and practice through the imposition of evidence requirements. This article presents findings from a small-scale micro-process study of three districts in one state during their first year of implementing those requirements. Informed by past conceptualizations of the research-practice gap and sociocultural theory, I look closely at how these practitioners made use of the state’s highly elaborated implementation tools for research-based decision-making. I argue that these micro-processes point to possible new dimensions of the research-practice gap—namely, practitioners’ understandings of the purposes of evidence, the degree of confidence evidence should provide, and the commensurability of different forms of evidence
