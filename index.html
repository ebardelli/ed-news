  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Coaching is an increasingly used professional development approach involving ongoing, individualized teacher-coach exchanges hypothesized to drive immediate changes in teachers’ practices with students. Examining this hypothesis, the present study quantifies marginal changes after individual coaching cycles in a set of commonly considered, high-quality teacher practices using a teacher fixed effects approach. It draws on panel data from 169 early childhood educators participating in a 9-month coaching intervention using the MyTeachingPartner approach intended to improve practices outlined in the Teaching Through Interactions framework. Results indicated that emotional support and classroom organization practices improved immediately after any coaching cycle, whereas others, like instructional support and literacy focus practices, only changed after cycles focused on those specific practices. Some immediate postcycle differences in practices endured over time, whereas others dissipated quickly.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Concern about harsh and inequitable discipline over the past two decades has galvanized a host of discipline reforms. These reforms have gained renewed attention in recent months as both the COVID-19 pandemic and mass uprisings against anti-Black violence have both bolstered calls to reimagine schools as caring spaces. This moment raises urgent questions about how researchers and policymakers should understand care in practice. In this review essay, I draw together recent research on discipline reform, as well as care feminism and key insights from critical policy analysis, to develop a conceptual framework for centering “care” in the current reform context. Using this critical-feminist care framework, I highlight the relations, experiences, systems, and ideologies that shape care in practice. I conclude with implications for researchers and policymakers.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study explores how the college-going culture at a no-excuses charter school with high college enrollment rates shaped students’ worldviews and trajectories. Drawing on 7 months of ethnographic fieldwork, I found that the school boosted college enrollment through student compliance to the college accountability policies rather than through the transmission of dominant cultural resources. Alignment between a student’s worldview and the school’s approach mediated their ability to draw on their full range of resources to participate in the college choice process and forge postsecondary trajectories they believed in. These findings foreshadow the potential impacts of “College for All” accountability structures and underscore the importance of cultural congruence in college-going cultures.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study is part of the international survey studies on teachers’ beliefs concerning the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning, and this paper reports the findings of the thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses elicited from 287 primary school teachers and teacher trainees in Taiwan. Using the seminal social psychology theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179–211, 1991) to frame the findings, this study highlights 11 perceived barriers and 11 perceived enablers that are thought to influence the teachers’ intention to integrate children’s literature in their mathematics teaching. More specifically, we identified time constraint, lack of pedagogical knowledge and confidence, and resource constraint as being the most-cited perceived barriers, while pedagogical benefits, desire to improve teaching, and enabling social norms were identified as the top perceived enablers. Ultimately, this article offers several recommendations to address some of these key perceived barriers.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundA recent stream of literature recognizes the impact of good/poor implementation on the effectiveness of programs. However, implementation is often disregarded in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) because they are run on a small scale. Replicated RCTs, although rare, provide a unique opportunity to study the relevance of implementation for program effectiveness.ObjectivesEvaluating the effectiveness of an at-scale professional development program for lower secondary school math teachers through two repeated RCTs.Research DesignThe program lasts a full school year and provides innovative methods for teaching math. The evaluation was conducted on two cohorts of teachers in the 2009/10 and 2010/11 school years. The program and RCTs were held at scale. Participating teachers and their classes were followed for 3 years. Impact is estimated by comparing the math scores of treatment and control students.SubjectsThe evaluation involved 195 teachers and their 3940 students (first cohort) and 146 teachers and their 2858 students (second cohort).MeasuresThe key outcome is students’ math achievement, measured through standardized assessment.ResultsIn the first wave, the program did not impact on students’ achievement, while in the second wave, a positive, persistent, and not insignificant effect was found. After excluding other sources of change, different findings across waves are interpreted in the light of improvements in the program implementation, such as enrollment procedure, teacher collaboration, and integration of innovation in daily teaching.ConclusionsRepeated assessment of interventions already at-scale provides the opportunity to better identify and correct sources of weak implementation, potentially improving effectiveness.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>A major area of critical scholarship within human rights education (HRE) aims to discover HRE’s revolutionary potential by questioning its relationship to the global human rights regime. However, the very concept of “human rights violations” remains underexamined. This article analyzes the use and function of human rights violations as pedagogical devices. Drawing from qualitative data collected in two public high schools in New York City (2014–2015), this study explores the limitations of teaching human rights through the legal definition of human rights violations. In doing so, HRE positions human rights violations primarily as manifestations of direct violence. We argue that to teach human rights violations also as expressions of structural violence can help students cultivate powerful and transformative forms of knowledge.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundPROMISE was a federal initiative to support youth receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) during the transition to adulthood.ObjectivesThis article presents estimates of the impacts of the six PROMISE projects on youth and family outcomes as of 18 months after enrolling in PROMISE.Research DesignThe study uses a randomized controlled trial design.SubjectsThe six PROMISE projects each enrolled a minimum of 2000 treatment and control youth (and their parents) residing in their service areas who were aged 14 to 16 and receiving SSI.MeasuresWe estimated impacts on outcomes related to youth and family service use, school enrollment, training, employment, earnings, and federal disability program participation using survey and administrative data.ResultsThe projects succeeded in connecting more youth to transition services and more families to support services during the 18 months after enrollment, and most increased the likelihood that youth applied for state vocational rehabilitation services. On average, there was no impact on youth’s school enrollment, but there were favorable impacts on youth’s receipt of job-related training, employment, earnings, and total income. The projects did not affect parents’ employment, earnings, or income, on average. For most outcomes PROMISE affected, the impacts varied substantially across the projects.ConclusionsThe positive short-term impacts of PROMISE on youth’s use of transition services, youth employment, and families’ use of services are consistent with the program logic model and suggest there might be potential for longer-term favorable impacts on youth and family outcomes.

  Abstract
                  <p>Expecting teachers to support their students in making mathematical connections is an unreasonable request when teachers themselves have not had opportunities to connect their own understandings. This study investigates how prospective elementary teachers can deepen their mathematical understanding using recommendations developed by mathematics education researchers for students to work with and on prior knowledge, especially when it presents problems for learning. This case study investigated 15 participants as they worked on elementary school mathematics tasks during a 10-day professional development course. The video data and prospective teachers’ journals were analyzed using Pirie-Kieren’s (1994) theory for the Dynamical Growth of Mathematical Understanding. Tracing two participants’ learning pathways revealed a connection-making process that deepened their understanding of elementary mathematics.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Online courses provide flexible learning opportunities, but research suggests that students may learn less and persist at lower rates compared to face-to-face settings. However, few studies have investigated more distal effects of online education. In this study, we analyzed 6 years of institutional data for three cohorts of students in 13 large majors (N = 10,572) at a public research university to examine distal effects of online course participation. Using online course offering as an instrumental variable for online course taking, we find that online course taking of major-required courses leads to higher likelihood of successful 4-year graduation and slightly accelerated time-to-degree. These results suggest that offering online courses may help students to more efficiently graduate college.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Hispanic and Latinx are terms that conflate ethnicity, race, and nationality and complicate our ability to generalize what it means for Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) to serve such a diverse student population. Latinidad has also privileged mestizo narratives that obscure enduring colonialities of power and perpetuate the invisibility of Indigenous Peoples. Conceptually framed by Critical Latinx Indigeneities, this study documents the testimonios of 10 Indigenous Mixtec/Ñuu Savi, Zapotec, and Nahua students at HSIs in California. I highlight issues of racialization and Indigenous misrepresentation within Latinx-centered curricula and programming and the ways participants engaged in fugitive acts of learning to claim new forms of visibility on campus. The findings raise important implications for HSIs, including Latinx programming that disrupts colonial perspectives and creates more nuanced understandings of diasporic Indigeneity within Latinx communities.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>An analysis of institutional data to understand the outcome of obstacles faced by students from historically disadvantaged backgrounds is important in order to work toward promoting equity and inclusion. We use 10 years of institutional data at a large public research university to investigate the grades earned by students categorized on four demographic characteristics: gender, race/ethnicity, low-income status, and first-generation college student status. We find that on average across all years of study, underrepresented minority (URM) students experience a larger penalty to their mean overall and STEM GPA than even the most disadvantaged non-URM students. Moreover, the URM students with additional disadvantages due to socioeconomic status or first-generation college status were further penalized in their average GPA. These inequitable outcomes point to systemic inequities in higher education for students with historically disadvantaged backgrounds and the need to dismantle institutional inertia to support them.

We explore how these rates vary over time and their relationship with the state unemployment rate. Annual rates of teacher attrition from the workforce have been between 5% and 8% for each of the past 35 years, and there is a strong negative relationship between unemployment rates and these rates of attrition. This history suggests that teacher attrition is likely to increase as the economy recovers after the pandemic, but this increase is likely to be modest.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This essay offers a framework for broader community involvement as a means of increasing the relevance and usefulness of evidence developed. This essay begins by defining key concepts related to democratizing the development of evidence. The sections that follow outline a logic model that calls for a bidirectional, iterative set of core activities to draw on insights from practitioners, community stakeholders, and researchers to generate a learning agenda, analysis plans, and findings that can be used to develop or refine policies and practices. The essay concludes with implications for advocates of democratizing the development of evidence and for researchers.

  Abstract
                  <p>The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no time constraints.</p>
