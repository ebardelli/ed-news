  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>A robust body of U.S.-based research demonstrates the importance of teachers of color to promote positive outcomes among students of color, and recent policies aim to increase the proportion of teachers of color. These policies are unlikely to succeed if they ignore how educational systems currently marginalize teachers of color, particularly early in teachers’ careers, when they are more likely to leave. Thus, we conducted a systematic narrative review of the experiences of novice teachers of color in K–12 schools. We identified 72 relevant studies, from 1996 to the present, and qualitatively analyzed themes within them. We found that novices’ experiences of their socialization into K–12 educational institutions were deeply racialized, through their interactions with every aspect of K–12 educational systems. Novices’ experiences often placed them in a double bind, as they experienced tensions between their personal commitments as people of color and their professional commitments in schools that perpetuated oppressive systems. Welcoming novice teachers of color into K–12 schools thus necessitates broader efforts to dismantle the many ways oppressive systems are embedded within and perpetuated by schools—efforts to which novice teachers of color can contribute, but for which they should not bear sole responsibility.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study was designed to assess the effects of states’ adoption of more rigorous standards as part of the current wave of standards-based reform on student achievement using comparative interrupted time series analyses based on state-level NAEP data from 1990 to 2017. Results show that the effects of adopting more rigorous standards on students’ mathematics achievement were generally small and not significant. The effects on students’ reading achievement were also generally small, but negative and statistically significant for Grade 4. The study also revealed that the effects of states’ adoption of more rigorous standards varied across NAEP subscales and student subgroups.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Assessment for learning emphasizes the importance of feedback to promote learning. To explore whether cognitive diagnostic feedback (CDF) promotes learning and whether it is more effective than traditional feedback in promoting learning, this study conducted a quasi-experiment by utilizing a longitudinal cognitive diagnostic assessment to compare the effect of three feedback modes on promoting learning, including CDF, correct–incorrect response feedback (CIRF), and no feedback. The results provided some evidence for the conclusion that CDF can promote students’ learning and is more effective than CIRF in promoting learning, especially in more challenging areas of knowledge.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite the widely recognized significance of critical incidents (CIs) in teachers’ professional learning, little research has investigated the role of CIs in language teacher identity development. This study attempts to fill this gap by exploring the contributions of a Telegram-based professional development course—framed around CI storying—to the language teacher identity development process of a group of teachers. Data were collected from 10 teachers before, during, and after the course. Data analyses indicated that, before the course, CIs negatively influenced the teachers’ agency and emotions. Participation in the course contributed, however, to the teachers’ enhanced agency and greater emotion regulation. In addition, the course afforded the teachers an opportunity to experience further professional socialization and collegial engagement. Our findings revealed that during the course, the teachers developed greater expertise in storying their CIs and discussed higher order issues relevant to the multiplicity of identity as connected to sociocultural-educational dimensions. These findings suggest that emotions and agency are two significant identity aspects that are profoundly influenced by and influence CIs. Our article closes with a discussion of the implications of embedding CIs in professional development courses to help teachers (re)construct their identities.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Historically and contemporarily students have been critical to bringing issues of justice in education policy to the fore. Yet, there have been limited formal spaces that elevate student voice scholarship in educational policy. In response, this Politics of Education Association (PEA) Yearbook Issue of Educational Policy aims to serve as a platform for opening up new areas for investigation, especially connections between theory to practice specific to student voice in educational policy and the politics of education. This collection of feature articles and research briefs offer diverse examples of how students are influencing change in education policy and practice, while also presenting the political realities and tensions that emerge when students participate in policy leadership activities.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper centers the voices of students who successfully struggled alongside justice-minded school board members and other concerned citizens to create anti-racist policy changes in Alexandria City Public Schools, Virginia. Specifically, we examine the history behind, and political processes involved with, changing the names of two local schools due to the racist political commitments of their namesakes. Lessons learned include the need to carefully structure the policy change process to include students, families, and other community members in critical dialog and amplify the voices of those most impacted by the structural racism that needs to be dismantled: The students.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Critical Participatory Action Research (CPAR) represents a tool for minoritized youth in shaping educational policies. Despite its promise, the politics of engaging in CPAR within structures ensnared in hegemonic ideologies can negate, devalue, and deny the contributions of youth voice. This study highlights how adult facilitators supporting youth researchers negotiate methodological tensions when the politics nested within oppressive structures converge with the ideals of CPAR. Using LatCrit methodology and employing affective labor theory, this qualitative study offers four counterstories interrogating the role of adult allies in CPAR, navigating the politics and perils of engaging in this work alongside minoritized students.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This study proposes transformation functions and matrices between coefficients in the original and reparameterized parameter spaces for an existing linear-linear piecewise model to derive the interpretable coefficients directly related to the underlying change pattern. Additionally, the study extends the existing model to allow individual measurement occasions and investigates predictors for individual differences in change patterns. We present the proposed methods with simulation studies and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation study demonstrates that the method can generally provide an unbiased and accurate point estimate and appropriate confidence interval coverage for each parameter. The empirical analysis shows that the model can estimate the growth factor coefficients and path coefficients directly related to the underlying developmental process, thereby providing meaningful interpretation.

  Abstract
                  <p>There are many kinds of borders in mathematics pre-service teacher education. This book explores borders that occur with curricula, teacher preparation programs, and interactions with society at large. A phenomenon of borders are the spaces closest to the border, called borderlands. It is in these borderlands that there might exist a potential for dissolving, removing, or bridging a border. Activity Systems are used as a way to visualize and interpret each chapter’s topic and issue. Tensions emerge between the various aspects of the Activity System, and these tensions can offer insight into negotiating borderlands and a border. A tension creates permeability across the border, and actions to resolve the tension become possible. The tensions that emerge in this review may provide opportunities for more people to be collaborators than mere bystanders in the work of mathematics pre-service teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we examine non-Indigenous pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) storylines in terms of how they conceive the call to incorporate First Peoples’ worldviews and perspectives into their mathematics teaching, a current/recent mandate of the province of British Columbia. In an undergraduate teacher preparation course, discussions of how teaching mathematics could align with Indigenous knowledges, pedagogies and perspectives were explored. Upon completion of the course, PSTs’ written reflections from the start and end of the course were examined using positioning theory to identify patterns and themes that emerged regarding their views of teaching mathematics with the current calls to Indigenize. In our analysis, there were examples of mathematical reframing, retemporalizing and repersonalizing, as well as an increasing willingness to rethink personal positions on the matter. By understanding the concerns that pre-service teachers have about integrating Indigenous knowledges, perceptions, pedagogies and teaching methods into mathematics education, university educators can begin to engage in productive conversations about how to best support non-Indigenous prospective teachers in this endeavour, as they embark upon the challenge of Indigenizing mathematics teacher education.</p>
