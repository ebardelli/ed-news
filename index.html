  Abstract
                    <p>We are interested in understanding how university students learn to use programming as a tool for “authentic” mathematical investigations (i.e., similar to how some mathematicians use programming in their research work). The theoretical perspective of the instrumental approach offers a way of interpreting this learning in terms of development of schemes by students; these development processes are called instrumental geneses. Nevertheless, how these schemes evolve has not been fully explained. In this paper, we propose to enrich the theoretical frame of the instrumental approach by a model of scheme evolution and to use this new approach to investigate learning to use programming for pure and applied mathematics investigation projects at the university level. We examine the case of one student completing four investigation projects as part of a course workload. We analyze the productive and constructive aspects of the student’s activity and the dynamic aspect of the instrumental geneses by identifying the mobilization and evolution of schemes. We argue that our approach constitutes a new theoretical and methodological contribution deepening the understanding of students’ instrumented learning processes. Identifying instrumented schemes illuminates in particular how mathematical knowledge and programming knowledge are combined. The analysis in terms of scheme evolutions reveals which characteristics of the situations lead to such evolutions and can thus inform the design of teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In India, a curriculum reform inspired by critical perspectives has sought to transform primary mathematics teaching and learning. It is aimed at strengthening socio-cultural-political connections between school mathematics and students’ life experiences, thereby challenging traditional textbook culture. At the same time, this initiative has retained the textbook as a vehicle of reform while seeking to subvert many of its established conventions. Guided by Remillard’s idea of modes of engagement, this paper analyses the innovative Math-Magic textbooks associated with the Indian National Curriculum Framework. It investigates how these textbooks represent and communicate the framework ideas, focusing on key curricular elements and on the teacher as reader. Analysing the ‘voice’ and ‘structure’ of the textbooks as well as the ‘contexts’ used, it is revealed that they use a radically unique voice to introduce school mathematics while also attempting to use authentic and socially relevant contexts within their tasks. However, they have limited structural support to communicate these ideas clearly to the teacher-reader. The paper has implications for studying reformed textbooks in primary school mathematics in the Global South, where they remain the main teaching resource for teachers. Further, by focusing on ‘context’, the notion of modes of engagement within textbooks is extended through socio-cultural perspectives.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Although strong references to expertise in different theoretical approaches to teacher noticing have been made in the last decades, empirical knowledge about the development of teacher noticing from novice to expert level is scarce. The present study aims to close this research gap by comparing three different groups of mathematics teachers with different degrees of professional teaching experience—pre-service teachers at the master’s level, early career teachers, and experienced teachers—using data sampled in the frame of the research program from the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M). Furthermore, the construct of teacher noticing is assessed in a differentiated way by analyzing different noticing facets. Findings confirm that three facets of teacher noticing can be empirically distinguished—perception of important classroom events, their interpretation, and decisions regarding further developments. The results reveal a considerable increase in professional noticing between master’s students and practicing teachers. However, in contrast to other studies, among examples from East Asia, a stagnation or decrease in professional noticing between early career teachers and experienced teachers could be observed. Overall, the study highlights the cultural dependency of expertise development regarding teachers’ noticing.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Visuospatial representations of numbers and their relationships are widely used in mathematics education. These include drawn images, models constructed with concrete manipulatives, enactive/embodied forms, computer graphics, and more. This paper addresses the analytical limitations and ethical implications of methodologies that use broad categorizations of representations and argues the benefits of dynamic qualitative analysis of arithmetical-representational strategy across multiple semi-independent aspects of display, calculation, and interaction. It proposes an alternative methodological approach combining the structured organization of classification with the detailed nuance of description and describes a systematic but flexible framework for analysing nonstandard visuospatial representations of early arithmetic. This approach is intended for use by researchers or practitioners, for interpretation of multimodal and nonstandard visuospatial representations, and for identification of small differences in learners’ developing arithmetical-representational strategies, including changes over time. Application is illustrated using selected data from a microanalytic study of struggling students’ multiplication and division in scenario tasks.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper reports from a case study which explores kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction in a teaching–learning activity about reflection symmetry. From a dialectical perspective, abstraction is here conceived as a process, as a genuine part of human activity, where the learner establishes “a point of view from which the concrete can be seen as meaningfully related” (van Oers &amp; Poland Mathematics Education Research Journal, 19(2), 10–22, 2007, p. 13–14). A cultural-historical semiotic perspective to embodiment is used to explore the characteristics of kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction. In the selected segment, two 5-year-old boys explore the concept of reflection symmetry using a doll pram. In the activity, the two boys first point to concrete features of the sensory manifold, then one of the boys’ awareness gradually moves to the imagined and finally to grasping a general and establishing a new point of view. The findings illustrate the essential role of gestures, bodily actions, and rhythm, in conjunction with spoken words, in the two boys’ gradual process of grasping a general. The study advances our knowledge about the nature of mathematical abstraction and challenges the traditional view on abstraction as a sort of decontextualised higher order thinking. This study argues that abstraction is not a matter of going from the concrete to the abstract, rather it is an emergent and context-bound process, as a genuine part of children’s concrete embodied activities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The multi-faceted nature of mathematics knowledge for teaching, including pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), has been studied widely in elementary classrooms, but little research has focused on senior secondary mathematics teaching. This study utilised the Knowledge Quartet (Rowland et al., Research in Mathematics Education, 17(2), 74–91, 2005) to analyse mathematics teaching at the senior secondary level using excerpts from a lesson on differential calculus and another on discrete probability distributions. The findings reveal that, at this level, there is a complex interplay among aspects of the Knowledge Quartet, including the impact of foundational knowledge on contingent moments. Horizon content knowledge is shown to play an important role in teaching decisions, as do perceived constraints. This has implications for future research into how teachers’ horizon knowledge might be expanded and into teachers’ perceptions of mathematics course constraints on the enactment and development of their mathematics knowledge for teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Understanding the intricate quantifier relations in the formal definitions of both convergence and continuity is highly relevant for students to use these definitions for mathematical reasoning. However, there has been limited research about how students relearn previous school mathematics for understanding multiply quantified statements. This issue was investigated in a case study in a 5-week teaching unit, located in a year-long transition course, in which students were engaged in defining and proving sequence convergence and local continuity. The paper reports on four substantial changes in the ways students relearn school mathematics for constructing quantified statements: (1) endorse predicate as formal property by replacing metaphors of epsilon strips with narratives about the objects ε, Nε, and ∣an − a∣; (2) acknowledge that statements have truth values; (3) recognize that multiply quantified statements are deductively ordered and that the order of its quantifications is relevant; and (4) assemble multiply quantified statements from partial statements that can be investigated separately. These four changes highlight how school mathematics enables student to semantically and pragmatically parse multiply quantified statements and how syntactic considerations emerge from such semantic and pragmatic foundations. Future research should further investigate how to design learning activities that facilitate students’ syntactical engagement with quantified statements, for instance, in activities of using formal definitions of limits during proving.</p>

For this purpose, 36 task-based interviews with pre-service primary and secondary mathematics teachers working in pairs who were given two structured problem-posing situations were conducted. Through an inductive-deductive category development, five types of activities (situation analysis, variation, generation, problem-solving, evaluation) were identified. These activities were coded in so-called episodes, allowing time-covering analyses of the observed processes. Recurring transitions between these episodes were observed, through which a descriptive phase model was derived. In addition, coding of the developed episode types was validated for its interrater agreement.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The nonequivalent groups with anchor test (NEAT) design is widely used in test equating. Under this design, two groups of examinees are administered different test forms with each test form containing a subset of common items. Because test takers from different groups are assigned only one test form, missing score data emerge by design rendering some of the score distributions unavailable. The partially observed score data formally lead to an identifiability problem, which has not been recognized as such in the equating literature and has been considered from different perspectives, all of them making different assumptions in order to estimate the unidentified score distributions. In this article, we formally specify the statistical model underlying the NEAT design and unveil the lack of identifiability of the parameters of interest that compose the equating transformation. We use the theory of partial identification to show alternatives to traditional practices that have been proposed to identify the score distributions when conducting equating under the NEAT design.

Maximum likelihood estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals for a two-rater G-index are derived for one-group and two-group designs. A new G-index of agreement for multirater designs is proposed. Statistical inference methods for some important special cases of the multirater design also are derived. G-index meta-analysis methods are proposed and can be used to combine and compare agreement across two or more populations. Closed-form sample-size formulas to achieve desired confidence interval precision are proposed for two-rater and multirater designs. R functions are given for all results.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The paper is based on an arts-based project that was aimed at understanding what ‘home’ means to migrant women in London. The project entailed teaching art techniques to 36 women participants and the active contribution of a large group of volunteers and research assistants. Women in the project were from various backgrounds but the majority were from Afghanistan. As such the project was conducted using multiple languages and a systematic collaboration among the research team members and between researchers and participants. This complex communication made the process of meaning-making of concept of home challenging. Three main challenges that were experienced in relation to this collaborative methodology have been identified and the strategies that were developed to address them are detailed. The three challenges in combining action research and arts methods that are discussed in this paper include: 1. Challenges about collective decision-making; 2. Challenges about the notions of progress and process; and 3. Challenges concerning stakeholders’ scope of experience. The paper offers a pathway towards working in contentious research settings between academia and community-based organisations in project that include participants from different backgrounds and speak various languages. We offer insights into how both researchers and participants can learn from challenges in deploying collaborative methodologies such as art practice in action research. We show here that incorporating art practice is a transformative action even when it is seen as far from an essential skill or unnecessary. Such action-oriented practices in research are directly related to United Nations’ sustainable development goals in reducing gender inequality and the opportunities that art practice can offer for quality education to marginalised groups in society.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>As student homelessness grows, little is known about how the timing and duration of homeless experiences shape K–12 outcomes. Using Los Angeles Unified School District administrative data, the authors examine whether these temporal dimensions of homelessness predict students’ achievement and attendance. The authors find that homeless students scored lower on math tests and missed more school days than students who were never homeless. These associations are largest when students experience homelessness in the year the outcomes are measured. Experiencing homelessness in only 1 year and in 2 or more years both negatively predict outcomes, but associations are larger for students experiencing homelessness in only 1 year.

  Abstract
                  <p>Due to rapid social and economic development in China over the last three decades, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become increasingly available in Chinese classrooms and families. However, there is a lack of research regarding Chinese students’ use of ICTs in mathematics learning. In this study, we examined how Chinese students access, use, and perceive ICTs in learning mathematics. To this end, a conceptual framework for ICTs and the role of ICTs in students’ learning of mathematics was established. Using a mixed-methods approach, we collected data from 223 students in four randomly selected secondary schools in Shanghai through a questionnaire survey, followed by classroom observations and interviews with students and teachers. The results revealed that various ICTs are widely accessible in Shanghai classrooms and students overall have a positive view about the role of ICTs in their mathematics learning, especially in problem solving and in learning geometry. When learning mathematics at home, students used handheld technological devices more frequently than non-portable devices. Furthermore, there were significant differences between different students in terms of school performance levels, grade levels, and genders in their use of ICTs in learning mathematics. In particular, students from high-performing schools had more access to various ICTs but used them less frequently than their peers from ordinary schools. Suggestions and implications of the findings are discussed at the end of the paper.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Teacher noticing can be an important element in improving teaching and students’ mathematical success. While the focus of the international project Learning from Lessons was on teacher learning, in this paper we report what mathematics teachers noticed and claimed to learn through the process of planning, teaching, and reflecting on their lessons. The study involved teachers and research teams from three countries (Australia, China and Germany) with different cultures, contexts and pedagogies. The explicit goal of the current study was to identify commonalities and differences with respect to those aspects that teachers noticed during their teaching. A multiple case study with three teachers, one from each of the three participating countries, was conducted using prompting questions to facilitate teacher reflection. The process of defining and refining categories for teacher noticing was implemented in the methodology. The findings suggest that there were many commonalities across the cases despite the different cultural and individual backgrounds of the teachers. The specific topic and individual lessons as well as the teachers’ expectations based on their lesson planning seemed to influence what the teachers noticed in their teaching process. The study highlights the importance of attending to the situational aspects of teacher noticing and learning.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Federal accountability policy mandates that states administer standardized tests beginning in third grade. In turn, third-grade test scores are often viewed as a key indicator in policy and practice. Yet literacy struggles begin well before third grade, as do racial and socioeconomic disparities in children’s literacy skills. Kindergarten readiness assessments provide a unique opportunity to better understand the emergence of literacy disparities. We use unique kindergarten literacy data from nearly every school division in Virginia to document the relationship between children’s early literacy skills and their later reading proficiency. When comparing children with similar literacy skills at kindergarten entry, we find significant racial and socioeconomic differences in the likelihood that a child will be proficient on their third-grade reading assessment.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Regression discontinuity (RD) designs are commonly used for program evaluation with continuous treatment assignment variables. But in practice, treatment assignment is frequently based on ordinal variables. In this study, we propose an RD design with an ordinal running variable to assess the effects of extended time accommodations (ETA) for English-language learners (ELLs). ETA eligibility is determined by ordinal ELL English-proficiency categories of National Assessment of Educational Progress data. We discuss the identification and estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE), intent-to-treat effect, and the local ATE at the cutoff. We also propose a series of sensitivity analyses to probe the effect estimates’ robustness to the choices of scaling functions and cutoff scores and remaining confounding.

  Abstract
                  <p>Beginning in the 1960s and early seventies, classroom research contributed to understandings and insights concerning the complexities and diversities of teaching. In the late 1990s, classroom research began to also include student voices in the classroom. Socio-cultural theory turned the empirical focus toward student interaction, and methodological development made new insights possible. The impact of this paradigmatic change is still in progress. At the same time, a rapid growth in international comparative classroom studies emerged, where the two most recognized comparative classroom research initiatives have been the TIMSS Video Studies, the first one initiated in 1995 at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Learner’s Perspective Study (LPS), initiated in 1999, at the University of Melbourne’s International Center for Classroom Research (ICCR). In this paper, we ask what it takes to carry out successful international classroom research, using the LPS as an example. The analysis shows that the LPS project design made it possible for research groups from different countries and cultures to participate in building a sustainable community of research practice specialized in working with the complexities in the study of teaching and learning in classrooms. Of particular importance was the intense and sustained collaborative work on data, where researchers of varying seniority and experience met and carried out scholarly work in relation to a shared dataset. While also having disadvantages, the heavy emphasis on data was crucial for creating and sustaining a reflexive international research community.</p>
