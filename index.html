  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Grow Your Own (GYO) programs are designed to recruit high school students, paraeducators, community organizers and parents, and/or career changers from the local community to join the educator workforce. When considering the nontraditional teacher pools that may enter the profession through GYO programs, commonly held assumptions about who teachers are, how they are developed, and what is most important for supporting their growth are challenged. This article reframes conventional narratives in teacher education by exploring the ways in which GYO programs offer counternarratives that reimagine teacher development by valuing (a) intersectional views of ethnoracial diversity, (b) resilience as an important teacher characteristic, (c) multiple modes of assessment as evidence of teacher learning, (d) ethnoracially diverse and community-based teacher educators, (e) culturally responsive pedagogy and place-based learning, and (f) local community school commitment.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper is a survey paper for the special issue on changes in Eastern European mathematics education in recent decades. In it I attempt to describe briefly the development of Eastern European mathematics education during the years that preceded the changes of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and to indicate certain questions for research pertaining to the subsequent period. Existing scientific literature about these topics is also discussed. One of the key problems that must inevitably be addressed is the problem of influence in mathematics education, which may be linked to quite varied political and organizational circumstances. The questions raised in the paper may be posed with respect to other countries as well, but in the countries of Eastern Europe, with their tumultuous and complex political history, the social aspect may be observed in greater relief than anywhere else. It is assumed that the analysis of general tendencies and patterns of development will be of interest even to a readership whose pursuits are otherwise far from Eastern Europe.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>It has been suggested that students’ epistemic understandings influence their practice of argumentation. However, how that influence takes place is not yet fully explained. To contribute to the answer to this question, this study explored elementary students’ epistemic understandings in their scientific argumentation. A 4-month qualitative case study with descriptive and interpretive emphases was conducted in a grade 5/6 science classroom in Canada. Nineteen students and their teacher participated in this study. Multiple methods for data collection were employed, including observation, interviews, and collecting students’ works. It was found that these students were aware of their epistemic understandings. Qualitative data analysis also revealed that students’ epistemic understandings can, yet do not always, influence their performance in argumentation by affecting the ways they think and do while engaged in argumentative dialogues. Moreover, it was found that elementary students were capable of refining their epistemic understandings through social interactions with peers and adapting their epistemic understandings in new contexts. Based on the findings, instructional suggestions are discussed to support the development of students’ epistemic understandings and argumentation skills.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Video and coaching as vehicles for teachers’ professional development have both received much attention in educational research. The combination of the two, video coaching, where teachers watch and discuss videos of their own practice with a coach, seems especially promising, but there is limited insight into how the design leads to desired teacher and student outcomes through mediating enactment processes. This review systematically synthesized the occurrences and co-occurrences of video coaching design features, enactment processes, teacher outcomes, and student impacts as reported in 59 empirical studies. The literature corpus contained information on design features for all studies, but the video coaching enactment processes were described in only half of the studies. Altogether, the studies showed that video coaching can support some positive teacher outcomes, such as changes in pedagogical behavior, but evidence was not consistently reported for all types of outcomes. Few studies examined impacts on learners. Taken together, this review revealed important gaps in knowledge, which highlights the importance of paying attention to unpacking teacher learning processes.

  Abstract
                  <p>Over the last years, there is a growing interest in studying students’ difficulties with rational numbers from a cognitive/developmental perspective, focusing on the role of prior knowledge in students’ understanding of rational numbers. The present study tests the effect of the whole or natural number bias (i.e., the tendency to count on natural number knowledge to interpret information about rational numbers and deal with rational number tasks), on students’ expectations about the size (i.e., bigger or smaller) and the type (i.e., natural number or decimal) of the results of multiplication and division. Items that were congruent and incongruent with students’ assumed expectations were administered to 91 seventh and eighth graders, asking them to evaluate equalities presenting multiplication and division between given and missing numbers. The results showed that besides the already well-documented effect of the size of results (i.e., multiplication makes bigger and division makes smaller), students tended to think that the numbers involved in multiplication and division should be of the same type (i.e., natural or non-natural, e.g., decimals). Both size and type of the numbers involved in the operations were significant factors affecting students’ evaluations, with size being stronger than type.</p>

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 2, Page 49-53, October 2021. <br>For many schools and districts in the United States, Facebook has emerged as an important tool for sharing timely information, building a sense of community, highlighting staff and students, and many other purposes. However, neither researchers nor schools and districts have paid enough attention to how their Facebook use may pose a risk to the privacy of individuals — often students who are minors. Joshua Rosenberg, Macy Burchfield, Conrad Borchers, Benjamin Gibbons, Daniel Anderson, and Christian Fischer describe their recent studies showing that 15-20 million photos of students have been shared on publicly accessible Facebook pages of public schools and districts. They estimate that at least 150,000 of these photos — and perhaps as many as a million or more — depict students who are identifiable by name and school or district. They review some of the risks to students that might result from such social media posts and offer practical steps that schools and districts can take to minimize these risks.

These include the splintered nature of the system, a lack of funding, and the low status and pay afforded to the early childhood workforce. Although early care programs, such as Head Start, have helped children in poverty, disparities in access and program quality in early childcare persist for young children of color, children with disabilities, and young dual-language learners.

Specifically, new understandings about the heritability of educational outcomes and the ability to calculate polygenic scores that predict likely student outcomes could change how educators identify students who are eligible for specific services. Russell Warne explains where the science currently stands, describes the benefits and possible drawbacks of using genetic technologies, and suggests policies for applying these technologies in schools.

The need to respond to students’ changing situations gives school districts and states an opportunity to reconsider how they are helping children and their families make the transition into kindergarten. Laura Bornfreund and Danielle Ewen suggest that, instead of developing more activities like information nights and school visits, districts and states should develop and implement annual transition plans designed to create alignment among all who support young children in the community, bringing them together to create goals and strategies for helping children move smoothly through early education.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 2, Page 28-32, October 2021. <br>The American system of schooling has been remarkably resistant to change, with most changes coming in the form of tinkering around the edges. Large-scale reform that alters what David Tyack and Larry Cuban (1995) referred to as the “grammar of schooling” has tended to fizzle out. David Labaree suggests that the practices that are most likely to become part of this persistent grammar of schooling, such as the age-graded classroom, are those that align with schools’ social mission and that meet schools’ organizational needs. Those two elements of the grammar of schooling must remain in balance if reform is to succeed.
