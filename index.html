          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Under test-based accountability, side-effects —including practices to inflate test results, often seen as cheating—are usually associated to so-called high-stakes policies. However, the influence of different types of stakes in the generation of this type of practices has been overlooked in education research. Based on a survey experiment, our results indicate that the type and level of stakes of accountability systems (e.g., high- vs. low-stakes, material vs. symbolic) do not differ in triggering side-effects. Counterintuitively, individual symbolic consequences trigger similar reactions among teachers than material incentives. In-depth interviews give insights into the social mechanisms that lead to symbolic effects having such an influence in understanding teachers’ reactivity to accountability.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 811-841, December 2022. <br>Stepped wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs) are increasingly being used to evaluate interventions in medical, public health, educational, and social science contexts. With the longitudinal and crossover natures of an SW-CRT, complex analysis techniques are often needed, which makes appropriately powering SW-CRTs challenging. In this article, we introduce a newly developed SW-CRT power calculator embedded within the power command in Stata. The power calculator assumes a marginal model (that is, generalized estimating equations) for the primary analysis of SW-CRTs, for which other currently available SW-CRT power calculators may not be suitable. The command accommodates complete cross-sectional and closed-cohort designs and includes multilevel correlation structures appropriate for such designs. We discuss the methods and formulas underlying our SW-CRT calculator and provide illustrative examples of the use of power swgee. We provide suggestions about the choice of parameters in power swgee and conclude by discussing areas of future research that may improve the command.

In this article, we introduce the methodology of portfolio analysis and describe a new command, portfolio, that provides a one-step solution for portfolio analysis. portfolio calculates the equal- or value-weighted returns with a t statistic for the portfolio and tests the significance of a long-short strategy in portfolios. portfolio also provides the Newey–West standard-error adjustment option for alleviating the impact of potential autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity in financial time series.

The quantitative component of Q-methodology employs a by-person factor analysis technique. However, currently there is no systematic approach for analyzing paired Q-sorts or longitudinal data in Q-methodology. We introduce the only statistical command available for the analysis of paired Q-sorts. The qpair command employs the factor extraction and factor rotation techniques in Stata. The command is illustrated using a dataset representing perceptions of 50 information technology professionals on person–organization fit regarding their training and development priorities.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 842-883, December 2022. <br>The regression control method, also known as the panel-data approach for program evaluation (Hsiao, Ching, and Wan, 2012, Journal of Applied Econometrics 27: 705–740; Hsiao and Zhou, 2019, Journal of Applied Econometrics 34: 463–481), is a convenient method for causal inference in panel data that exploits cross-sectional correlation to construct counterfactual outcomes for a single treated unit by linear regression. In this article, we present the rcm command, which efficiently implements the regression control method with or without covariates. Available methods for model selection include best subset, lasso, and forward stepwise and backward stepwise regression, while available selection criteria include the corrected Akaike information criterion, the Akaike information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, the modified Bayesian information criterion, and cross-validation. Estimation and counterfactual predictions can be made by ordinary least squares, lasso, or postlasso ordinary least squares. For statistical inference, both the in-space placebo test using fake treatment units and the in-time placebo test using a fake treatment time can be implemented. The rcm command produces a series of graphs for visualization along the way. We demonstrate the use of the rcm command by revisiting classic examples of political and economic integration between Hong Kong and mainland China (Hsiao, Ching, and Wan 2012) and German reunification (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2015, American Journal of Political Science 59: 495–510).

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 924-940, December 2022. <br>In this article, we introduce a new command, cspa, that implements the conditional superior predictive ability test developed in Li, Liao, and Quaedvlieg (2022, Review of Economic Studies 89: 843–875). With the conditional performance of predictive methods measured nonparametrically by the conditional expectation functions of their predictive losses, we test the null hypothesis that a benchmark model weakly outperforms a collection of competitors uniformly across the conditioning space. The proposed command can implement this test for both independent cross-sectional data and serially dependent time-series data. Confidence sets for the most superior model can be obtained by inverting the test, for which the cspa command also offers a convenient implementation.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 4, Page 969-974, December 2022. <br>Incidence rates are popular summary measures of the occurrence over time of events of interest. They are also called mortality rates or failure rates, depending on the context. The incidence rate is defined as the ratio between the total number of events and total follow-up time and can be estimated with the strate command. When the event of interest can occur multiple times on any given subject over a time period, like infections, the incidence rate represents an average count per unit of time, such as the average number of infections per year. When the event of interest can occur only once, such as death, an alternative summary measure is the risk, or probability, of occurrence per unit time, such as the risk of dying in one year. In this article, I present the stprisk command, which estimates risks, and illustrate its use and interpretation through a data example.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper introduces the term explorative mathematical argumentation (EMA), signifying a concept for describing and analysing learners’ mathematical argumentation processes. Despite multiple recent empirical evidence for argumentation promoting learning in science education, still little is known about the development of early mathematical argumentation skills and their role within early learning processes. The widely varying use of the term argumentation impedes respective research efforts. The concept of explorative mathematical argumentation offers an approach that takes into account the explorative nature of learners’ knowledge construction as well as specific aspects of mathematical argumentation. The concept of EMA promotes mathematical argumentation as a separate competence facet within which different forms and tools of reasoning can be deployed. It is suitable for describing and analysing learners’ mathematical argumentation processes from an early age onwards, as is illustrated by an exemplary situation with 4- and 5-year-old preschool children. Eventually, methods for identifying and analysing learners’ explorative mathematical argumentation processes are presented for discussion.</p>

        <a href='aera open'>Wednesday, 04. January 2023</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, our teacher preparation program shifted to an online setting, disrupting a key feature of practice-based teacher preparation: preservice science teachers’ (PSTs) approximation of rigorous and responsive instruction during extended pedagogical rehearsals, called macroteaching. Given this unplanned shock to their preparation, we examined how PSTs viewed macroteaching and their evolving participation in the teaching rehearsal. Using a situative perspective, we collected multiple forms of data. We found that although PSTs wanted to enact rigorous and responsive instruction, their participation was deeply affected by the sudden shift to an online setting. Our analysis of video-recorded lessons confirmed PSTs’ observations that their instruction became less rigorous and responsive over time. We conclude with questions about teacher preparation during the pandemic.

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics teaching is challenging particularly for teachers who have just started their careers. Research on this sort of teacher has focused separately on their knowledge, identity, or instructional quality. Yet, teaching mathematics as a profession requires synthetic and comprehensive competency. To fill this gap, this study investigates the relationship between changes in instructional quality and professional competency for teaching mathematics in terms of knowledge, skills, and identity. The current study recruited two beginning mathematics teachers who had the same teacher education backgrounds and worked at the same high school. We collected and analyzed video and audio recordings of their instruction and meetings and interviews about instruction. The findings reveal how their instructional quality changed during the first 3 years of teaching in addition to their heterogeneous professional competency for teaching mathematics. While both had high levels of mathematical knowledge for teaching, they differed in the extent of their skills for ambitious teaching and identity concerning mathematics instruction. Based on the findings, we argue that teacher education needs to value all aspects for professional competency synthetically, for indeed possessing mathematical knowledge alone is insufficient for a high quality of instruction. We also discuss approaches in teacher education about skills and identity for teaching mathematics.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics education is like many scientific disciplines witnessing an increase in scientific output. Examining and reviewing every paper in an area in detail are time-consuming, making comprehensive reviews a challenging task. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms like topic models have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their ability to summarize large amounts of unstructured text into coherent themes or topics allows researchers in any field to keep an overview of state of the art by creating automated literature reviews. In this article, we apply topic modeling in the context of mathematics education and showcase the use of this data science approach for creating literature reviews by training a model of all papers (n = 336) that have been presented in Thematic Working Groups related to technology in the first eleven Congresses of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (CERME). We guide the reader through the stepwise process of training a model and give recommendations for best practices and decisions that are decisive for the success of such an approach to a literature review. We find that research in this period revolved around 25 distinct topics that can be grouped into four clusters: digital tools, teachers and their resources, technology experimentation, and a diverse cluster with a strong focus on student activity. Finally, a temporal analysis of these topics reveals a correlation between technology trends and research focus, allowing for reflection on future research in the field.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The transition from school to university mathematics is a challenging process for many students, which is reflected in high dropout rates during the first year at university. Using mediation analysis, we want to shed light on the role of students’ attitudes towards mathematics—especially their interest in mathematics and their mathematical self-concept—for early dropout and investigate the underlying mechanisms for the relations between attitudes and dropout. Informed by frameworks of person-environment-fit and results from educational psychology, we consider satisfaction with one’s studies and achievement as potential mediators, influencing the relations between attitudes and early dropout. Our results within a sample of 274 first-year students, enrolled in a pure mathematics or a teacher education program at a German university, show that interest in university mathematics and mathematical self-concept are associated with less risk to drop out. In the case of interest, this relation is mediated by students’ satisfaction, and in the case of self-concept, this relation is mediated by satisfaction and achievement. Based on these results, we discuss how to support students during the transition from school to university mathematics in order to prevent early dropout.</p>
