  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>From 2005 to 2015, the number of Black teachers in Michigan dropped by 48%, substantially exceeding declines in the corresponding K–12 Black student population. These teacher losses are an acute phenomenon within a broader national context of deurbanization of K–12 student populations away from those districts with the largest and most established faculties of color. Districts receiving large numbers of incoming Black students hired few Black teachers over the period, leading to marked declines in Black student exposure to Black educators, and Black employment gains since 2016 have generally been in areas where Black teachers were already employed. We discuss the historical conditions under which Michigan’s Black faculties were established and multiple forward-looking challenges to building and sustaining Black faculties in geographically diffuse populations.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>With the looming impacts of COVID-19 on district budgets, the growth of school choice options, and population shifts across urban, suburban, and rural contexts, an increasing number of districts have closed schools and more districts are expected to follow this trend. Rich scholarship has examined school closures; however, this field of research is limited in scope and methodological approach, and overwhelmingly focuses on the mass urban school closures of the mid-2010s. This offers a timely opportunity to consider new directions in the field. In this article, we identify trends in the scholarship on school closures by examining the empirical research in this area over nearly two decades. We conclude by offering a research agenda for future scholarship on school closures.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Leveraging achievement data measured in the fall and spring of kindergarten through eighth grade for 840,000 students attending 8,800 public schools, we report novel evidence on how achievement and growth patterns differ between rural and nonrural schools. Rural students start kindergarten slightly ahead of nonrural students but fall behind by middle school. The divergence is driven by larger summer losses for rural students. In both rural and nonrural schools, we provide additional evidence that Black–White achievement gaps widen during the school year. These findings highlight the importance of seasonal learning patterns in interpreting rural school performance.

  Abstract
                  <p>Teaching mathematical modeling is a demanding task. Thus, fostering teachers’ competencies in this regard is an essential component of teacher education. Recent conceptualizations of teachers’ competencies include situation-specific skills based on the concept of noticing, which is of particular interest for the spontaneous reactions needed when teaching mathematical modeling. The study described in this paper aims to analyze the development of a video-based instrument for measuring teachers’ noticing competencies within a mathematical modeling context and obtain evidence for the validity of the instrument. Three kinds of validity are examined in three different studies: content validity, elemental validity and construct validity. Indicators for content validity could be found through different expert ratings and implementation with the target group, where participants were able to perceive all relevant aspects. The qualitative analysis of participants’ reasoning, which is consistent with the coded level, indicates elemental validity. Moreover, the results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest construct validity with one overall factor of noticing competence within a mathematical modeling context. Taken together, these studies imply a satisfactory validity of the video-based instrument.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Theories of learning developed in education and psychology for the past 100 years are woefully inadequate to support the design of schools and classrooms that foster deep learning and equity. Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners’ full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people’s lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Theories of market-based school reform suggest that teacher labor markets may be inefficient because schools lack autonomy to incentivize performance in hiring, retention, and compensation. We test this empirically by comparing teacher exits in the deregulated market of New Orleans with neighboring traditional school districts. We find that the relationship between teacher performance and retention is stronger in the deregulated market. We also find positive associations between salary and performance, but only when teachers transfer from one charter school to another. While teacher retention is more closely tied to performance in New Orleans, this did not yield a net gain in teacher quality, because new teachers in New Orleans were of lower average quality than their peers in neighboring districts.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State and national school accountability policies situate preventing chronic absenteeism on par with meeting state standardized test benchmarks. We question relying on school attendance as both a component of accountability policies and a means of enhancing equity in schools. Our research suggests out-of-school factors unrelated to missed instruction account for most of the associations between absences and test score achievement—with unexcused absences driving those associations. Excessive absences—and particularly unexcused absences—don’t harm students mainly through missed instruction. Instead, they reflect out-of-school harms students endure that have produced inequalities for years—and will continue to do so even if students show up or parents call in.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Taking the school bus has long been an integral part of the school experience in the U.S. However, not much is known about how school transportation relates to getting to school each day, particularly for students with disabilities. This study used ECLS-K: 2011 to explore two issues. First, we examined what characteristics are associated with taking the school bus, comparing students with and without disabilities. Second, we evaluated the link between taking the school bus and absenteeism for these groups. In the first set of findings, school bus taking is differentiated by student and family characteristics, as well as by urbanicity. We find no major differences in characteristics associated with taking the bus between students with disabilities and students without. As for the second set of findings, students with more common disability diagnoses had fewer absences compared to both students without disabilities as well as those with lower incidence diagnoses, suggesting that taking the bus is related to better attendance behaviors for some students with disabilities. Implications are discussed.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This essay argues that contemporary debates about the role of practice in teacher education run the risk of reproducing mind/body, thought/action dualisms. Absent these binaries, practice is understood as always theoretical, principled, and contextualized and knowledge and identity are understood as always embodied and enacted. The author discusses nonbinary theories of practice and their application in teacher education scholarship within both historical and political contexts. The essay argues that the practice turn in teacher education might be leveraged to enhance the field’s intersectional imagination and to eschew the polarities and linearities the field has inherited from Western enlightenment philosophy.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Objectives: This study examines the effectiveness of a formal financial education program for improving the financial literacy of primary school children and how this effectiveness is influenced by informal financial education provided by parents, such as giving pocket money and discussing money matters. Method: A quasi field experiment was carried out at the Museum of Saving in Turin where children participated in a financial education program (the treatment). The first two out of three classes that arrived at the museum were assigned to the treatment group and the third one to the comparison group. Difference-in-differences models are estimated using financial literacy data from a pretest taken about 1 week before the visit to the museum and a posttest taken on the day of the visit; just before starting with the program at the museum for the comparison group and just after program completion for the treatment group. Results: In line with previous studies, we find that our formal financial education program had a positive effect on the financial literacy of primary school children. The empirical findings provide weak evidence that this effect of formal financial education is stronger for children who received informal financial education from their parents. Conclusions: Our study contributes to the previous literature by presenting further evidence that a short extra-curricular course can be effective in increasing economic and financial literacy among students. Furthermore, we present suggestive evidence—worth of further research—that informal financial education can reinforce the effect of formal financial education.J.E.L. Codes: A29, C93, G40

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Drawing on data from the RAND American School Leader Panel 2020 COVID-19 Distance Learning Surveys, we analyze principal perceptions of school preparedness for distance learning with a specific focus on how different school types (e.g., rural, urban, and suburban) and student groups (e.g., students with mild disabilities, English learner students) were impacted by rapid school closure. These findings have important implications for how state education agencies, policymakers, and districts plan to address the growth of opportunity gaps among student groups. In addition, findings have important implications for education leadership and policy researchers seeking to design and implement studies to inform next generation policy and practice.

  Abstract
                  <p>This article uses a cultural-developmental framework to illuminate the interplay between collective and individual activity in the mathematical reasoning displayed in a university Masters level lesson on fractals. During whole class and small group discussions, eleven students, guided by an instructor, engage in inductive reasoning about the area and perimeter of the Sierpinski triangle, a unique mathematical object with zero area and infinite perimeter. As participants conceptualize and communicate about the Sierpinski problem, they unwittingly generate a linguistic register of action word forms (e.g., fencing, zooming) and object word forms (e.g., area, infinity) to serve Sierpinski-linked mathematical reasoning functions, a register that we document in the first analytic section of the article. In the second analytic section, we report a developmental analysis of microgenetic, ontogenetic, and sociogenetic shifts in the word forms constitutive of the register and their varied functions in participants’ activities. In the third analytic section, we provide a cultural analysis of the classroom’s collective practices, practices that enable and constrain participants’ constructions of form-function relations constituting the register. We examine the ways in which participants work to establish a common ground of talk in their communicative exchanges, exchanges supported by classroom norms for public displays of reasoning and active listening to one another’s ideas. We show that it is as participants work to establish a common ground that the register emerges and is reproduced and altered. We conclude by pointing to ways that the analytic framework can be extended to illuminate learning processes in other classroom settings.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>According to commognitive conceptualization, development of mathematical thinking, whether historical or ontogenetic, requires periodic transitions to mathematical discourse incommensurable with the one that has been practiced so far. In this new discourse, some familiar mathematical words will be used in a new way. Historically, such discursive transformations were usually greeted with resistance and led to heated, centuries-long debates. Also for today’s learners, a discourse incommensurable with the one currently in use constitutes a source of much trouble. This is particularly true in those cases in which the change in the use of words occurs tacitly, leading to apparent paradoxes. In this paper, I argue that discourses of finite and infinite sets are mutually incommensurable, and thus the case of students grappling with Sierpiński triangle (ST) may lead to insights about ways in which learners act in the face of incommensurability. Here, possible sources of the confusion reported by the participants are identified with the help of specially designed discourse-analytic tools. It is shown that the students, imperceptibly to themselves, oscillate between the discourses of area-as-a-segment-of-a-plane and of area-as-a-number. The analysis is followed with discussion on theoretical, methodological and practical implications of this study.</p>

We present an interview study based on mathematicians’ pairwise evaluations of student-produced summaries of a proof demonstrating the uncountability of the open unit interval. We present a thematic analysis, exploring features of mathematicians’ pairwise decision-making and their priorities in evaluating summaries. We argue that the students’ proof summaries shared several properties with traditional modes of proof-writing and were frequently evaluated against similar conventions. We consider the consequences for research and practice with proof comprehension and conclude that proof summaries have the potential to form the basis of a new approach to assessment in this area.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>With increased tensions and political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States, schools are facing greater challenges in ensuring support for their students of immigrant and Latinx origin. This study examined the associations between county-level immigration arrests and academic achievement, absenteeism, and measures of school climate and safety for students in the California CORE districts. Using ordinary least squares regression analyses with year, grade, school, and student fixed effects, we found that immigration arrests corresponded to declines in academic achievement, attendance, and various measures of school climate and safety for Latinx students and Latinx students who were English learners. We also find small declines in measures of school climate and safety for students who ever received special education services via an Individualized Education Program. Associations were strongest for arrests that occurred during the Trump administration compared with those that occurred during the second term of the Obama administration. Policy implications are discussed.
