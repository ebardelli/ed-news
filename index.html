  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Field experiences during teacher preparation programs support teacher candidates in forming and reforming teacher identities through real-world teaching situations. Trying out teaching approaches with children, reflecting on practice, and collaborating with cooperating teachers support teacher candidates in building a teacher identity. However, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, public schools closed in many states, requiring that field placements either end or change significantly. This is a study of five teacher candidates in an early childhood teacher preparation program. These candidates’ field placement ended in March 2020, requiring that university faculty develop an alternative teaching placement. Using Bourdieusian theoretical concepts of habitus, field, and doxa, this study explores how the candidates perceived this change and how they were able to continue to reflect and build their teacher identities.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Following increased attention to racial disparities in police use of force, national conversations have focused on the role of law enforcement, including in public schools. This study examines transparency with regard to the presence of law enforcement in schools. Leveraging novel school-level and district-level data from the state of Florida, this research shows that the majority of schools and about a third of school districts do not make information on law enforcement presence in schools publicly available. Furthermore, the study finds that schools and districts serving more White student bodies have higher levels of transparency around law enforcement than those serving less-White demographics, an important finding given the racialized context of current policy discussions around policing in US schools and society more broadly. These findings inform ongoing debates about law enforcement in schools while also raising implications for policy and practice around the racialized nature of government transparency.

  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present severe challenges to the education sector more than 2 years after the first case was detected. We explore the strategies South African teachers used to support continued mathematics learning at home during the COVID-19 pandemic across different stages of the response to it and across different contexts. We explore these strategies, first, in relation to the initial shift to emergency remote teaching when learners needed to be reached in their homes under severe lockdown regulations, then through the gradual reopening of schools later as regulations were relaxed. Activity theory informs our perspective on the way in which teachers worked to mediate learning across school and home activity systems. Twenty-five Grade 4–7 mathematics teachers from the Eastern Cape responded to two questionnaires given at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown period and during the phased return to school. Questions focused on the strategies used to support mathematics learning. The results show that strategies focused on engaging caregivers through various technologies and getting resources into the home. WhatsApp, a free internet-based messaging service, was the most frequently used communication app across all types of schools for both messaging parents and sending instructional material and support in the form of videos, pictures and text messages. Department issued workbooks and teacher designed work packs were key resources sent to homes. Differences are evident in the range of use of different technologies across wealthier and poorer schools. Primary teachers’ voices inform possible ways forward for the purpose of managing young student mathematical learning gaps and meeting ongoing learning needs.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study explores secondary mathematics teachers’ perceptions of the experiences that contributed to their capacities to understand mathematical modeling and to facilitate students’ modeling experiences. The retrospective research methods and transformative learning theory frame used in the study honor teachers as adult learners and value their perspectives while providing a way to study the complexity of learning to model and to teach modeling. Data analysis identified triggers and knowledge dilemmas that challenged and prompted teacher learning as well as opportunities to resolve dilemmas through rational discourse and critical reflection. Patterns in teacher-identified meaningful learning experiences reveal a trajectory with strands that address aspects of doing and teaching mathematical modeling: mathematics, social aspects of learning, real-world contexts, student thinking, and curriculum. Results of this study provide a holistic view of learning to do and teach mathematical modeling, complementing studies of designed professional learning interventions that out of necessity target specific parts of the modeling process. The results both support and challenge common teacher education content and practices. The study illustrates the usefulness of retrospective methods to understand teachers as lifelong learners.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes the collaborative development of an agenda for research on e-assessment in undergraduate mathematics. We built on an established approach to develop the agenda from the contributions of 22 mathematics education researchers, university teachers and learning technologists interested in this topic. The resulting set of 55 research questions are grouped into 5 broad themes: errors and feedback, student interactions with e-assessment, design and implementation choices, affordances offered by e-assessment tools, and mathematical skills. This agenda gives a framework for a programme of research aligned with practical concerns that will contribute to both theoretical and practical development.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, scholars have determined various determinants of environmental degradation using the panel and time-series studies. However, technological innovations (TI) and remittances, among the financial system’s essential components, are relatively ignored. In addition, nations’ economic progress and environmental performance also depend upon the nature of their economic structure. This empirical research investigates the effects of TI, remittances and economic complexity (EC) on CO2 controlling economic growth and trade openness (TR) in the selected 15 Asian nations. The study collected panel data of 15 Asian countries from 1990 to 2019 and employed the panel quantile regression and augmented mean group methods to unveil the impacts of variables on CO2 emissions. The empirical findings established that remittances are negatively linked with CO2 emissions. Similarly, EC reduces CO2 emissions in the context of Asian countries. In addition, EC and remittances Granger cause CO2 emissions. These findings indicate that remittances and EC positively contribute to environmental quality in Asian countries. Conversely, TI, economic growth, and TR intensify CO2 emissions in Asian countries. Finally, the study recommended policies to enhance remittances and EC in Asian countries to curb environmental degradation.

  Abstract
                  <p>Generalisation is a skill that enables learners to acquire knowledge in general, and mathematical knowledge in particular. It is a core aspect of algebraic thinking and, in particular, of functional thinking, as a type of algebraic thinking. Introducing primary school children to functional thinking fosters their ability to generalise, explain and reason with mathematical relationships. It also helps them overcome difficulties in understanding functions when they are exposed to the idea more formally in secondary education. Although more and more special education students are enrolled in mainstream schools, little is known about algebraic thinking in that community, especially in the case of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Students with ASD often exhibit deficits that interfere directly with mathematical learning. The study discussed here, which was conducted in the context of algebraic reasoning, was aimed primarily at identifying and describing the strategies and representations observed in 26 ASD primary education students when performing a task that involved a linear function, and describing the generalisations they performed. The 26 participants were enrolled in 19 mainstream Spanish schools. The tools used, a questionnaire and semi-structured interview, were designed to explore their ability to generalise in a problem involving the function f(x) = 2x + 2. The strategies identified included: (a) bald answering; (b) modelling with manipulatives; (c) drawing; (d) counting and (e) operating. The strategy most frequently observed was operating, represented verbally or symbolically, followed by drawing. Only three students generalised but did not reach the highest level of functional thinking, namely, ‘functions as objects’. The results are compared with findings for mainstream students of similar ages. Conjectures around the possible relationships between some findings and the type of thinking characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are put forward. The results carry implications for research with and teaching of students with ASD.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates the support provided using technology for learning the notion of normal distribution in high school students through the implementation of a teaching experiment. A strategy was designed and implemented using Fathom software as the main teaching resource. Data analysis focused on the role of the use of technology in student learning and the simulation process, considering the initial session. The conceptual framework was based on the documentational approach to didactics, whose perspective is to study the teacher’s use and design of resources in his teaching practice. Likewise, the results of the teaching experiment, whose objective was to introduce high school students to the notion of normal distribution by taking advantage of the repeated sampling resource using the Fathom software, are presented. The results show that the collaborative aspect of the lesson study methodology allowed professors to reflect and become aware of how they usually use the resources in their regular practice and thus contribute to improving their teaching activity. Evidence is provided on how students initiate a change in their reasoning to identify the probability of data collection from the simulation of problems with the software.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The overwhelming presence of a procedural meaning of equality and equations reported in previous research has led to a call for suitable pedagogical interventions to nurture a relational meaning of these concepts. This paper is a response to that call. Drawing on the theory of objectification, the first part deals with the configuration of a Grade 3 (8–9-year-old students) teaching–learning activity that seeks to create the classroom conditions for the formation of the mathematical operations and operation-based rules that underpin the algebraic simplification of linear equations. Instead of using problems involving abstract open arithmetic sentences or alphanumeric equations (e.g., 
                    
                    \(5 + \_\_\)
                    
                   = 16; 
                    
                    \(2n + 3 = 11\)
                    
                  ), the teaching–learning activity resorts to story-problems. Two visual semiotic systems serving to model and solve the story-problems were devised. The story-problems were framed in narratives that allowed the teacher and the students to infuse equations, their equating parts, and the mathematical operations with contextual meanings. The first part of the paper includes the theoretical assumptions about the teaching–learning activity and its configuration, and a rationale behind the devisal of the semiotic systems. The second part presents a Vygotskian multimodal genetic analysis of the teaching–learning activity; that is, an analysis that shows the formation of concepts in motion, in the process of their genesis. The genetic analysis sheds some light on the way students, in their work with the teacher, encountered and refined the cultural-historical algebraic meanings of the equal sign and equations, and the concepts required in solving equations.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Research literature on the role of mathematics teachers during the COVID-19 crisis shows that teacher preparation for emergency situations is required. In reporting on this exploratory study, we present and analyse lesson plans created by seven future teachers for mathematics classes during the pandemic. Data were collected between April and October 2021 from 16 four-hour class sessions in a Mathematics Degree Program at a public university in Medellín, Colombia. The notion of Humans-with-Media and the Learning by Expanding theory were used as frameworks to understand what roles prospective mathematics teacher (PMTs) assign to technologies for teaching in pandemic conditions. The PMTs’ uses of technology for teaching mathematics during a pandemic were categorized. The results show that technology was used to reorganize and reproduce mathematics teaching practices. This report addresses the impact of technology on the activity system, and we conclude with a discussion of opportunities and limitations of students’ conceptions about teaching and technology during a pandemic.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The recent push toward active learning – engaging students in the learning process – is meant to benefit students. Yet there is still much to learn about students’ perceptions of this phenomenon. We share results from an interview study of students’ perceptions of features of two active learning models institutionalized at a large doctoral-granting university – a model for teaching foundational mathematics courses and an early field experience model for teaching preservice secondary students to teach mathematics. These models were implemented simultaneously in a single precalculus course. Interviews were conducted with both student populations (i.e., precalculus students and preservice teachers) to understand which in-class features of the models students noticed and identified as beneficial to their learning. Precalculus students identified specific opportunities related to active learning in the undergraduate mathematics teaching model – working in groups on mathematics tasks that engaged students in sensemaking and interacting with their instructor around mathematics. Preservice teachers identified specific opportunities related to three features of the university field experience model – observing a mathematics instructor enacting ambitious instructional practices, planning and teaching a “real” lesson, and observing student thinking and practicing teaching moves during groupwork. We conclude with pedagogical recommendations about particular features of the models that may help mitigate student resistance to active learning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As earlier research results suggest that many mathematics teaching students criticize a missing relevance in their studies, we explore explanations and interrelationships of their relevance assessments. We aim at finding out how one could support the students in attributing relevance to their study programs. A two-fold model for relevance assessments in mathematics teacher education is proposed, consisting of relevance content and relevance reasons. We investigate students' relevance perceptions of mathematical topics and of topics’ complexities, as well as their rating of individual and societal/ vocational relevance reasons, all in relation to their perception of the relevance of their overall program of study. Contrary to earlier research findings, our results suggest that mathematics teaching students already do attribute relevance to many content areas and that a preparation for the teaching profession is not the only reason for them to assign relevance. There also seem to be many students who would attribute relevance if they could develop as individuals and pursue their interests. We suggest that giving students opportunities to set individual priorities in their studies could hence support their relevance assessments. As low relevance assessments seem to be connected to students’ motivational problems, students might profit from motivational support, as well.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Since the early 2000s, accountability and evaluation have been regarded by policymakers as key mechanisms for “fixing” teacher education and by many teacher education leaders as vehicles for elevating the status of the profession and uniting a fragmented field. Although educational inequity has been an enduring and endemic problem during the same time period, most major policy proposals regarding teacher education evaluation and accountability have said very little about equity. This article makes an argument for equity-centered teacher education evaluation and accountability by highlighting nine innovative examples that collectively illustrate what it means and what it looks like to position equity at the center of teacher education evaluation/accountability. Together, these examples are intended to be generative, providing a lens into how the interrelated dimensions of strong equity-centered evaluation play out at different sites of practice and how equity initiatives emerge and operate at different levels of policy.

In the absence of federal or state statutes, school boards are left to navigate the issue of minors with Do Not Resuscitate Orders while at school. We examine state statutes and school board polices for minors with Do Not Resuscitate Orders attending or wishing to attend school. Themes from school district policies are discussed, and recommendations for federal, state, and local policymakers are made.
