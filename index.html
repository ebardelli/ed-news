  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this study was to, first, examine the potential of lesson plans (LPs) of preservice science teachers (PSTs, N = 631) as a source for gathering rich data on their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and, second, qualitatively describe PSTs’ reasons for the level of data richness in their LPs on PCK. PSTs’ handwritten LPs were analyzed through an analytic rubric, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 79 randomly selected PSTs. Results revealed a range of the level of data richness of the PSTs’ LPs on PCK and five descriptive categories about the PSTs’ reasons for the richness of LP data on PCK. The study implies that researchers should consider the inclusion of the LP as a valid tool in their triangulation design; however, they should weigh the factors that influence the collection of rich data in their PCK studies to triangulate findings better to portray a holistic picture of PCK.

  Abstract
                  <p>Integrated STEM activities are espoused as appropriate for enhancing student learning in relation to statistical concepts; however, a greater understanding of the way in which students’ ideas about those concepts develop is needed to maximise the learning potential offered by engagement in STEM activities. For this study, plant growth was chosen as a topic from the Year 6 Australian Science Curriculum as an appropriate context to employ aspects of the four STEM disciplines to explore students’ developing ideas about variation. Sixty-four Year 6 students across three school terms worked in groups of four to trial various treatments and their effects on the growth of radish or wheat seeds. This report considers two aspects of student learning related to this topic based on (i) the formative assessment of features of students’ workbook entries specifically related to variation during the part of the classroom activity based on their TinkerPlots graphs and (ii) the later summative evidence of learning in responses to end-of-year questions on the activity for 56 of the students. The workbook entries are presented via a qualitative analysis to provide evidence of the forming of understanding of variation in a STEM context, with the SOLO Taxonomy being employed to assess the longer-term evidence and developmental nature of that learning. Overall, a broader picture has emerged of the potential for developing appreciation of variation in a STEM context in primary school.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Public media both reflects and shapes societal perceptions and attitudes. Teachers and others around students in mathematics classrooms have expectations for the students, projected with what appears in these media. We are most concerned about the expectations placed on students who are identified with minoritized groups—particularly students who are Indigenous or migrated to Norway. We investigate how minoritized group contexts and mathematics education appear together in Norwegian news media texts. Our analysis uses the notion of storylines to describe the expectations about minoritized groups that news media project. We found seven entangled storylines: “the majority language and culture are keys to learning and knowing mathematics,” “mathematics is language- and culture-neutral,” “minoritized groups’ mathematics achievements are linked to culture and gender,” “extraordinary measures are needed to teach students from minoritized groups mathematics,” “students from minoritized groups underachieve,” “students from minoritized groups put in extraordinary effort and time to learn mathematics,” and “minoritized mathematics students are motivated by gratitude.”</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study examines technology-enhanced teacher responses and students’ written mathematical explanations to understand how to support effective teacher responding and the centering of students’ mathematical ideas. Although prior research has focused on teacher noticing and responding to students’ mathematical ideas, few studies have explored the revisions that students make to their written explanations after teacher responding and very few explore this in authentic classroom contexts. Four high school geometry teachers and thirty of their students participated in project-based tasks examining the relationships between scale factor and the dimensions, surface area, and volume of a rectangular prism. The teachers’ written feedback and the students’ written explanations were coded and scored. Results show that student explanations improved significantly after students received feedback about their mathematical ideas. Furthermore, results indicate that the teacher feedback may be more effective if it focuses on mathematical relationships between variables and that additional feedback about the variables alone may have little impact. Results contribute to an understanding of how eliciting students’ written mathematical explanations might support effective teacher responding in classroom contexts.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study presents the views of stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa SSA on the present status of practical physics teaching in the secondary schools of the region and the obstacles to improvement. Their views have been analysed to establish critical factors that govern practice and have guided the formulation of a system description of the influences on the learning of practical physics. This study puts systemic understanding in the foreground and argues that such insights are critical to future reforms. Data were collected from four countries in SSA. Qualitative data were gathered from student focus groups and semi-structured interviews with school staff, ministry officials and educationalists. Illustrative quotes are reported extensively in the paper. The comments were transcribed and coded to identify common themes and factors. Quantitative surveys were carried out with students and physics teachers. The range of data acquisition is crucial in offering conclusions and suggestions that are of broader SSA relevance. The study confirms the expected wide gap between practices in the countries studied and economically developed countries. This gap is attributable to lack of material resource, limited teacher skills and staff development, ambivalent attitudes to practical work, prioritisation of ‘theory’, lack of interest in inquiry, neglect of relevant assessment and absence of relevant employment. An influence diagram was generated showing the strong connections between these and wider social and cultural factors. The study shows that effective reform requires a broad and politically attractive change.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 319-343, June 2022. <br>The revealed preference approach in economics is central to the empirical analysis of consumer behavior. In this article, we introduce the commands checkax, aei, and powerps  as a bundle within the package rpaxioms. The first command allows a user to test whether consumer expenditure data satisfy several revealed preference axioms; the second command calculates measures of goodness of fit when the data violate these axioms; and the third command calculates power against uniformly random behavior as well as predictive success for each axiom. We illustrate the commands using individual-level experimental data and household-level aggregate consumption data.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 269-292, June 2022. <br>Commonly used unit-root tests in time-series analysis—such as the Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron tests—use a null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root. Such tests have low power against the alternative—when a time series is near integrated or highly autoregressive—implying that they do poorly in distinguishing such a series from having a unit root. Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, Journal of Econometrics 54: 159–178) introduced the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test, in which the null hypothesis is that the series is stationary, to deal with this problem. One shortcoming of the presently available Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test in Stata is that it uses asymptotic critical values regardless of the sample size. This poses a problem in that researchers—especially social scientists—are often presented with short time series. I introduce kpsstest, a command that extends the previous implementation by including an option for a zero-mean-stationary null hypothesis, generating sample and test-specific critical values, and reporting appropriate p-values.

Spatial regressions can be estimated using the spregress, spxtregress, and spivregress  commands. These commands allow users to fit spatial autoregressive models in cross-sectional and panel data. However, they are designed to estimate regressions with continuous dependent variables. Although binary spatial regressions are important in applied econometrics, they cannot be estimated in Stata. Therefore, I introduce spatbinary, a Stata command that allows users to fit spatial logit and probit models.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 416-429, June 2022. <br>In statistical work, it is essential to have an overview of the data used. In, for example, biomedical articles, a standardized way of reporting summaries of continuous and categorical variables is “table 1”. This standardized way of reporting can be useful in most cases of statistical work. The basetable command is a flexible and straightforward way to build and format such table reports. The final reports are easy to style into Stata Markup and Control Language, commaseparated values, HyperText Markup Language, LATEX or TEX, or Markdown and, for example, save into a file specified by the using modifier. Also, it is possible to export the reports created by basetable into Excel worksheets. Because of the General Data Protection Regulation, it has become necessary to blur information on individuals when making reports; in basetable, there are options to blur both categorical and continuous data.

However, information about the variables’ frequencies gets lost in the process. binscatterhist solves this issue by allowing the user to further enrich the graphs by plotting the variables’ underlying distribution. The binscatterhist command includes options for different regression methods, including reghdfe (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College) and areg, and robust and clustered standard errors, with automatic reporting of estimation results and sample size.

However, in the presence of noncompliance, this can often lead to biased estimates because intention-to-treat analysis completely ignores varying levels of actual treatment received. This is a known issue that can be overcome by adopting the complier average causal effect approach, which estimates the effect the trial had on the individuals who complied with the protocol. When compliance is unobserved in the control group, the complier average causal effect estimate can be obtained via a latent class specification using the gsem command.

This command produces estimates, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals for the average treatment effect. The utility of the command is demonstrated with both simulated and real data of right heart catheterization. These illustrations show that the proposed estimator implemented by the robustate command indeed exhibits more robustness against limited overlap than the traditional inverse-probability weighting estimator. The main method of the command is proposed in Sasaki and Ura (2022, Econometric Theory 38: 66–112).

Computationally, sivqr implements the smoothed estimator of Kaplan and Sun (2017, Econometric Theory 33: 105–157), who show that smoothing improves both computation time and statistical accuracy. Standard errors are computed analytically or by Bayesian bootstrap; for nonindependent and identically distributed sampling, sivqr is compatible with bootstrap. I discuss syntax and the underlying methodology, and I compare sivqr with other commands in an example.

  Educational Researcher, Volume 51, Issue 5, Page 336-351, June/July 2022. <br>Trans-informed administrative guidance introduces concepts from trans studies to educational leaders, but researchers have relatively ignored these policy implementation tools. This content analysis describes the design of administrative guidance using a representative sample of 112 Illinois districts: the who, what, how, and why of supporting transgender students. The results substantiated evidence of trans-informed guidance that introduced complex gender “definitions” and legitimized students’ identity. Many of these same texts also included barriers to supporting students with administrative gatekeeping, definitions reinforcing the gender binary, and mandates to involve parents in access decisions. All but one district (96%) highlighted existing state and local policies to motivate administrative actions around 13 issues. A minority of the texts provided specific directions to guide decision-making and reform efforts. This paper includes areas of concern and suggestions as policymakers initiate gender reforms.
