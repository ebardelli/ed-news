  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Studies consistently show associations between school absences and academic achievement. However, questions remain about whether this link depends on the reason for children’s absence. Using a sample of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (n = 4,419), we investigated whether the association between school absenteeism and achievement in high-stakes exams at the end of compulsory and postcompulsory schooling varies with the reason for absence. In line with previous research, our findings show that overall absences are negatively associated with academic achievement at both school stages. Likewise, all forms of absences (truancy, sickness absence, exceptional domestic circumstances, and family holidays) are negatively associated with achievement at the end of compulsory and postcompulsory schooling. First difference regressions confirm these negative associations, except for family holidays. These findings suggest that, in addition to lost instruction, other mechanisms such as behavioral, health-related, and psychosocial pathways may account for the association between absenteeism and achievement. The findings have implications for designing tailored absenteeism interventions to improve pupils’ academic achievement.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This study utilizes life history methodology to understand how White teachers develop racial awareness while also exploring how the education profession acts as an inflection point for racialized understandings of the world. Furthermore, as the educators in this study grew in their racial awareness, there was a rise in conflicting and ambivalent feelings as they attempted to teach in ways that aligned with their newly developed awareness. These feelings surfaced as the educators grappled with issues of race, Whiteness, and systemic inequality in both their profession and in their personal lives. Using a framework of Critical Whiteness Studies, this study provides a nuanced and contextual discussion of White identity development. Ultimately, findings show that educators begin to understand race through proximity, exposure, and repeated interaction with students of Color. This holds major implications not only for educators and teacher education programs but also for students of Color.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ preference to remain close to where they grew up is recognized as a defining feature of the teacher labor market. Using a unique data set from a large school district in the southeastern United States, I apply a series of within–school and within–student comparisons to assess the effectiveness of homegrown teachers who returned to teach in their home district. Discrete time survival analysis is then used to examine differences in when early career teachers exit the district. Study results show that homegrown teachers make small but statistically meaningful improvements in student achievement in English language arts. They are also more likely to identify as Black compared with other beginning teachers and less likely to exit the district.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Responding to the identified need for reflection, critique, and evaluations of appreciative inquiry (AI), a form of action research, this article presents a critical reflection on an application of AI in a cross-cultural music education research project. AI was selected as it appeared to both have potential for addressing the complexities related to power imbalances, ethnocentrism, and coloniality inherent in a project aiming to co-develop music teacher education in Finland and Nepal, and because its 4D model supported the co-constructing of visions, which was central to the project. The critical reflection presented in this article focused on three situations of breakdown that occurred during the research process. Analysis of these breakdowns highlighted the need for researchers to engage responsibly in research as participants, account for dreaming as an unevenly distributed capacity when working with visions or aspirations, and develop skills facilitating collaborative spaces that cultivate listening for and appreciating difference. The article concludes by recognising the limitations of undertaking this reflection independently rather than collaboratively and by cautioning against the instrumentalization of appreciation, calling instead for sincere appreciation. Overall, the article contends that the process of identifying and generating new understandings of breakdowns is a powerful approach for stimulating researcher reflexivity.

All three EL groups had lower test scores than never-ELs throughout K-4. In math, ELs grew more than never-ELs during academic years but lost more during summers. In reading, ELs grew less than never-ELs in K-1 and grew more in later grades, but ELs also lost more during summers. These findings suggest summer support is required to help ELs maintain and develop academic skills.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The majority of community college entrants aspire to earn a bachelor’s degree; yet fewer than a third do. States use several strategies to support community college’s transfer function, including a transferrable core curriculum, a block of pre-major coursework universally accepted at public postsecondary institutions. In this study, we used statewide administrative data from Texas—a state with a transferable core—to examine pre-transfer credit accumulation and how pre-transfer core credits predict bachelor’s degree attainment and time to degree for community college transfer students. Our results illuminate high variation in pre-transfer core credit accumulation among community college transfer students. Each additional pre-transfer core credit improves students’ probability of earning a bachelor’s degree, but only up to core completion status. Soon after students are core complete—at which point universities are no longer required to transfer in additional core credits, students experience a negative relationship between core credits and bachelor’s degree attainment.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The clinical teaching experience is one of the most important components of teacher preparation. Prior observational research has found that more effective mentors and schools with better professional climates are associated with better preparation for teacher candidates. We test these findings using an experimental assignment of teacher candidates to placement sites in two states. Candidates who were randomly assigned to higher quality placement sites experienced larger improvements in performance over the course of the clinical experience, as evaluated by field instructors (a.k.a university instructors). The findings suggest that improving clinical placement procedures can improve the teaching quality of candidates.

  Abstract
                  <p>Note-taking in tertiary education is a challenging activity which requires listening, processing and recording new information at the same time. However, in lectures at a high presentation rate, students often have to choose between these activities. One solution which is frequently proposed to mitigate this problem is the use of guided notes, instructor-provided handouts containing blanks that are filled in class. In this article, we investigate how the provision of guided notes in an undergraduate mathematics course can support student learning. A self-report survey reveals that students value guided notes as a tool to remain focussed during the lecture, to process and store new information and to foster active engagement. Moreover, they prefer guided notes both compared to lectures without instructor-provided notes and with full notes.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Despite calls for evidence-based decision making, the field has a limited understanding of how educational leaders actually engage research. This study draws on a nationally representative sample of 368 district and school leaders who named pieces of research that were useful to their work. Educational leaders found frameworks and practical guidance in the form of books to be most useful. They report turning to research across different domains of leadership practice, including supporting their own professional learning, guiding instructional activities for others, and monitoring and supporting implementation. While a small portion of sources named would qualify for the top three “tiers of evidence” of the Every Student Succeeds Act, those sources named as useful for program selection more frequently met these criteria. Together, these findings offer a broader portrait of research use, one rooted in leaders’ engagement with research as a part of their multifaceted and complex practice.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges to schools, leaving principals to lead rapid organizational change with limited guidance or support. Drawing on interviews from a larger, national study of principals at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed the experiences of 20 principals in four large, urban school districts—Boston, Denver, New York, and San Diego. We found that principals relied on both district guidance and preexisting school structures and conditions as they led through the crisis. Although no principals were satisfied with district guidance, principals responded to guidance on a spectrum—from abiding, to challenging, to subverting guidance. Principals’ responses were associated with their perceptions of the internal capacities of their schools, as well as the district guidance. Our findings support an emergent typology of principals as middle managers during crisis, which sheds light on how principals act as middle managers and how districts can support their work.
