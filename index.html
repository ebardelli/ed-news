          Abstract
                  <p>To make instructional decisions that interrupt inequitable talk in the classroom, teachers must notice it in the first place. In a two-year Professional Learning Experience (PLE) focused on the core practice of facilitating equitable discussions, we found that two different groups of math teachers took up the work of noticing for equity in different ways and with varying degrees of success. We analyzed teachers’ written goals for teaching, videos of their in-person classroom instruction, video recordings of their coaching sessions, and sets of video annotations. Our findings indicate that teachers who noticed for equity: (1) engaged in conversations about status and identity (2) had more student-centered goals, and (3) were more likely to select “bumpy moments” of their instruction to discuss in coaching sessions. These findings have implications for instructional coaches, teacher educators, and professional learning facilitators interested in supporting teachers with noticing inequitable talk in their classrooms.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The Making Pre-K Count and High 5s studies represent a recent application of a phased two-stage, multi-level design, which was used to examine the effects of two aligned math programs implemented in early childhood settings. The purpose of this paper is to describe the challenges encountered in implementing this two-stage design and to describe approaches to resolving them. We then present a set of sensitivity analyses the study team used to examine the robustness of the findings. During the pre-K year, pre-K centers were randomly assigned either to receive an evidence-based early math curriculum and associated professional development (Making Pre-K Count) or to a pre-K-as-usual control condition. In the kindergarten year, students who had been in Making Pre-K Count program classrooms in pre-K were then individually randomly assigned within schools to small-group supplemental math clubs that were designed to sustain the gains from the pre-K program, or to a business-as-usual kindergarten experience. Making Pre-K Count took place in 69 pre-K sites, comprising 173 classrooms across New York City. High 5s took place in the 24 sites that were part of the public school treatment arm of the Making Pre-K Count study and included 613 students. The study focuses on the effect of the Making Pre-K Count and High 5s programs on children’s math skills at the end of kindergarten as measured by two instruments, the Research-Based Early Math Assessment-Kindergarten (REMA-K) and the Woodcock–Johnson Applied Problems test. The multi-armed design, while logistically and analytically challenging, balanced multiple considerations of power, the number of research questions that could be answered, and efficiency of resources. Robustness checks suggest that the design created groups that were both meaningfully and statistically equivalent. Decisions to use a phased multi-armed design should consider both its strengths and weaknesses. While the design allows for a more flexible, expansive research study, it also introduces complexities that need to be addressed both logistically and analytically.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Saturday, 04. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Establishing effective climate control and reducing the ecological footprint (EF) are necessary for pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal 13. In this context, it is required to enhance the understanding of various factors that can either decrease or enhance the EF. In the literature to date, limited studies on external conflicts (EX) have reported diverse results, and also the impacts of government stability (GS) on EF are less explored. This study explores the roles of external conflicts, economic growth, and government stability on EF in the context of SDG-13. The study also contributes to the literature by examining the environmental effects of government stability and external conflicts for the first time in Pakistan. This research uses time-series methodologies on data from Pakistan from 1984 to 2018 for exploring the long-run relations and causal dynamics. The results unfolded that external conflicts stimulate and Granger cause EF and therefore expand environmental deterioration. Thus, limiting conflicts is in the favor of Pakistan to achieve SDG-13. Surprisingly, government stability also poses harmful impacts on environmental quality by enhancing the EF, indicating that stable governments focus on improving economic conditions rather than environmental quality. Moreover, the study proves the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve. Policy suggestions are made to move forward in achieving SDG-13 and to evaluate the effectiveness of government environmental policies.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This response to “How Teacher Education Matters” (2000) notes that the evidence base about the features of teacher education that matter for teacher effectiveness was substantial at that time and has grown stronger since. However, federal policy over the last two decades has reduced support for both preservice teacher education programs and for candidates’ financial assistance, while increasing support for alternative certification pathways that generally omit student teaching and often truncate coursework as well. One-third of teachers in recent years have entered without having completed preparation and are disproportionately assigned to schools serving low-income students and students of color. Meanwhile, recent research emphasizes the critical importance of well-designed clinical experiences with strong mentoring in high-quality settings, connected to applied coursework, as key to effectiveness. Residency programs are one emerging model that combines such experiences with financial supports, showing promise for recruiting and retaining a diverse, well-prepared set of candidates in high need fields and locations. High-performing countries like Finland and Singapore make these kinds of investments in teacher education routinely and shed light on the policy strategies needed to create a universally strong teacher education system.

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Friday, 03. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article is a rejoinder, some 20 years later, to a JTE editorial, titled “The Problem of Teacher Education.” The previous piece suggested that in response to unprecedented attention by high-level policy makers to “fixing” the “broken” system of teacher education, teacher education was treated as what I called a “policy problem” during the late 1990s and 2000s From this perspective, the goal was to identify which of the broad aspects of teacher education that could be controlled by policymakers was most likely to have a positive impact on teacher quality, defined primarily in terms of teachers’ effectiveness at producing a strong workforce for the new economy. In this new article, the author argues that now—during the 2020s—teacher education should be constructed as an “equity problem.” This means acknowledging that, despite many important and powerful multicultural and other initiatives over the last two decades, dominant educational and social policies, practices, and frames coupled with deeply institutionalized and intransigent racism, linguicism, and homophobia continue to produce educational inequality and inequity and continue to impede the recognition and representation of minoritized groups in determining shared educational values and purposes. A short list of contemporary scholarship and preparation programs/projects that construct teacher education as an “equity problem” is included.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Supporting teachers’ attention and responsiveness to the substance of student thinking is increasingly emphasized across disciplines. Yet studies demonstrate how such responsiveness, in practice, is highly contextualized and often fleeting. This study conceptualizes and examines what functioned as “resources for responsiveness” within and across nine sustained cases of responsiveness in three science teachers’ inquiry-oriented classrooms. Analyses demonstrated how a diverse range of personal, social, and material/structural resources facilitated teachers’ responsiveness, with some commonalities but also much variation across teachers. These findings contribute to the field’s understanding of what may support teachers’ attention and responsiveness to student thinking and suggest the importance of (a) responsiveness in the design and facilitation of professional learning and (b) increased attention to teachers’ affect.

          Abstract
                  <p>This article proposes an interconnected framework, Ways of thinking in STEM-based Problem Solving, which addresses cognitive processes that facilitate learning, problem solving, and interdisciplinary concept development. The framework comprises critical thinking, incorporating critical mathematical modelling and philosophical inquiry, systems thinking, and design-based thinking, which collectively contribute to adaptive and innovative thinking. It is argued that the pinnacle of this framework is learning innovation, involving the generation of powerful disciplinary knowledge and thinking processes that can be applied to subsequent problem challenges. Consideration is first given to STEM-based problem solving with a focus on mathematics. Mathematical and STEM-based problems are viewed here as goal-directed, multifaceted experiences that (1) demand core, facilitative ways of thinking, (2) require the development of productive and adaptive ways to navigate complexity, (3) enable multiple approaches and practices, (4) recruit interdisciplinary solution processes, and (5) facilitate the growth of learning innovation. The nature, role, and contributions of each way of thinking in STEM-based problem solving and learning are then explored, with their interactions highlighted. Examples from classroom-based research are presented, together with teaching implications.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, Sleeter reflects on her previous article, “An Invitation to Support Diverse Students through Teacher Education.” She argues that her earlier recommendations are still valid, but changing conditions have lent them greater urgency. Research has made clear the positive impact of culturally relevant curriculum and pedagogy on students of color. Although White teachers still dominate the profession, White students are no longer in the majority. But schools are still highly racially segregated, with unequal access to resources, and school closures coupled with increased online education have only widened racial gaps. Because of these conditions, she argues that public education needs federal leadership.

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Thursday, 02. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The pursuit of multiple educational outcomes makes teaching a complex craft subject to potential conflicts and competing commitments. Using a data set in which teachers were randomly assigned to classes paired with videotaped lessons, we both document and unpack such a tradeoff. Upper-elementary teachers who excel at raising students’ math test scores often are less successful at improving student-reported engagement in class (and vice versa). Furthermore, teaching practices that improve test scores (e.g., cognitively demanding content) can simultaneously decrease engagement. At the same time, paired quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal two areas of practice that support both outcomes: active mathematics with opportunities for hands-on participation, physical movement, and peer interaction; and established routines and procedures to proactively organize the classroom. In addition to guiding practice-based teacher education, our sequential, explanatory mixed-methods analysis can serve as a model for rigorously studying and identifying dimensions of “good” teaching that promote multidimensional student development.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>It is a healthy exercise to debate the merits of using effect-size benchmarks to interpret research findings. However, these debates obscure a more central insight that emerges from empirical distributions of effect-size estimates in the literature: Efforts to improve education often fail to move the needle. I find that 36% of effect sizes from randomized control trials of education interventions with standardized achievement outcomes are less than 0.05 SD. Publication bias surely masks many more failed efforts from our view. Recognizing the frequency of these failures should be at the core of any approach to interpreting the policy relevance of effect sizes. We can aim high without dismissing as trivial those effects sizes that represent more incremental improvement.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 18-23, March 2023. <br>Over the past year, debates over the prevalence, distribution, and effects of teacher vacancy and underqualification have dominated many education narratives. Authors J. Cameron Anglum, Andrew R. Diemer, Walter G. Ecton, and Tuan D. Nguyen consider these debates in the context of growing interest in career and technical education (CTE) in high school settings. Research on secondary CTE teachers, including the quantification of teacher shortages in specific CTE content areas, remains insufficient to inform effective recruitment and retention policies. This dearth of scholarship on CTE teachers undermines the improvement of CTE programs.

Recognizing this, Skyline High School propelled its teacher academy program in a new direction and redesigned it in a way that is mutually beneficial to the teacher academy students, preK-12 learners, and the education workforce. R. Lennon Audrain and Gregory Mendez recount how, working in close partnership with its district human resources department and Arizona State University, Skyline’s teacher academy students develop pedagogical content knowledge about the science of reading, apply it tutoring experiences at a local elementary school, and earn industry credentials that signal specialized knowledge and skills.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 29-33, March 2023. <br>Career exploration traditionally starts in middle school. However, there are advantages to starting discussions about career and preference in the early grades. California’s Cajon Valley Union School District is using the World of Work curriculum systemically from kindergarten to high school. Children learn about their personality types, do activities related to professions, and hear from professionals. Ed Hidalgo, who developed the curriculum and helped put it into practice at Cajon Valley, talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the advantages of starting in the early grades, as well as the importance of encourage students to understand and explore their strengths and preferences.

This reality is what Greg Thompson, Leslie Rutkowski, and David Rutkowski call the validity paradox. Educators can surmount this paradox by following a five-step model in which they make a claim, make the opposite claim, and then determine how well both claims are supported by the available evidence. This process can enable practicing educators to make more valid decisions based on data.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 40-43, March 2023. <br>School leaders juggle the often-inconsistent goals of maintaining support of middle- and upper-income families for public education and, at the same time, implementing policies to strengthen equity for low-income students. Author Iris C. Rotberg describes how these tradeoffs play out in different communities, the role of concentrated poverty and segregation, and potential options for making equity gains while maintaining widespread support for public education.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 6-11, March 2023. <br>Policy makers have taken more interest in career and technical education (CTE) in recent years, but evidence regarding what kinds of programs produce the most important outcomes is still emerging. Shaun M. Dougherty summarizes what recent research tells us about the impact of these programs. Evidence has shown that CTE-dedicated schools, career academies, and programs linked to workforce needs can improve high school graduation rates and workforce earnings, but research is still emerging on how well CTE programs prepare students for postsecondary education. Most of the recent research has not focused on equity in CTE programs, and educators must remain vigilant to ensure equitable access and outcomes.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 12-17, March 2023. <br>Industry-recognized certifications (IRCs) are designed by businesses, industrial groups, and state agencies to enable students to demonstrate their skills related to a specific profession and to enable industries to know whether potential employees are qualified for specific jobs. To understand the value of these certifications, Matt Giani analyzed data from more than a million Texas public high school graduates. The data showed some positive relationships between IRCs and students’ future earnings and college enrollment and persistence, but the links are sometimes weak and vary depending on the IRC earned. And most students earning an IRC did not move on to work or postsecondary study in areas aligned with their credentials.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 54-55, March 2023. <br>Events of recent years have led many students and parents alike to question why schools work the way that they do. Students have asked why they should have to come to class when they can do the work at home. Community members have questioned why students are having to learn about contentious issues. While not all of questions are equally valid, education leaders have a responsibility to provide some kind of answer. Joshua P. Starr suggests that the answer comes down to ensuring that the value proposition for schools is clear. And in this new era, the development of community may be among the most important value propositions for public schools.
