  Abstract
                  <p>Lesson study is a Japanese concept to improve teaching and learning mathematics through a particular form of activity in which a group of teachers works collaboratively to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on the proposed research lessons. Although lesson study is internationally acknowledged as providing key learning opportunities for teachers, there is limited information on post-lesson discussion and its contribution toward teachers’ professional growth. This study has the aim of describing the key features of post-lesson discussions. An entire group of teachers at a public elementary school in Japan participated in three lesson study cycles. During the post-lesson discussion in each cycle, the teachers were invited to write down what they believed was significant in the planned lesson and their comments regarding the lessons, for the discussion. The writings and comments were collected and analyzed. This method helped capture teachers’ ‘voices’ better compared to recordings of oral discussion. The results of the analyses of teachers’ writings and comments revealed that a major part of post-lesson discussions involved issues related to pedagogies, and teachers’ reflections tended to focus more on students’ thinking and mathematical topics over time as the cycles of lesson study proceeded. The results suggested that teachers’ professional growth can be related to their recognition of the importance of understanding students’ thinking and their perspectives on mathematics, in order to improve teaching.</p>

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>When did sociologist Orlando Fals-Borda name his method Participatory Action Research (PAR), and what were the epistemological implications of this shift from action research to PAR? To address these questions, this article critically examines Fals-Borda’s ‘participatory turn’ —his epistemological shift from orthodox Marxism to the participatory paradigm—, which squarely underpinned the origins of PAR yet has hitherto remained unexplored in the literature. The article focuses on Fals-Borda’s transition from participation “by” to participation “with” the people, which occurred during a period of intense self-criticism after years of radical activism. Drawing on exhaustive archival research, it examines the collaborative systematisation of his method alongside an emerging constellation of participatory research practices. Thereby, it highlights the centrality of collaboration to the development of his work and demonstrates that Fals-Borda’s embrace of the participatory paradigm stemmed from rejecting the centrality of historical materialism in favour of a model of research which supports and sustains the conditions for collective analysis and action through harnessing the creativity and wisdom of marginalized peoples. It concludes that for all the innovations in tools and techniques of action-oriented methods, the ontology of participation is what fundamentally differentiates PAR from other instrumental or top-down forms of people’s participation in research.

  Abstract
                  <p>One goal of inquiry-oriented instruction is student engagement with others’ mathematical ideas. This paper analyzes a relatively short episode in which students engaged with others’ ideas; the instructor facilitated engagement in order to support students in making mathematical progress. Students expressed some bafflement pertaining to the apparently paradoxical zero area and infinite perimeter of the Sierpiński triangle. The instructor strategically facilitated collective argumentation centered on their reasoning, resulting in several ideas that functioned-as-if-shared in the classroom community. In this report we capitalize on this classroom discussion to contribute to theory and methods for investigating the complex intersection of engagement and argumentation.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School principals are facing greater challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic than they have ever faced, which has implications for whether they can conduct their work productively and remain in their jobs over the long term. This article draws on a unique, nationally representative, longitudinal panel of K–12 public school principals across the United States to examine principals’ self-reported resource needs and job demands during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as how those resource needs and demands are related to principals’ dissatisfaction and their intention to leave their job. Although principals’ reported resource needs (which increased over time) and teacher shortages were consistently related to dissatisfaction and intention to leave, various other job demands were predictors of dissatisfaction but not the intention to leave. These results have several implications for supporting and retaining principals as well as the teachers they serve.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States provide substantial support for higher education through appropriations to public colleges and universities that can be used to maintain relatively low tuition levels and funds for financial aid. Higher education often receives disproportionate cuts during recessionary periods, and it faces potentially unprecedented reductions in coming years amid a pandemic that has left some states with revenue shortfalls. How states approach higher education cuts has the potential to exacerbate existing inequities among racially minoritized and low-income students and historically underfunded institution types. In this study, we document trends in higher education funding over time and use latent profile analysis to identify distinct approaches states have taken to higher education funding. We then examine the trajectories of higher education funding within each approach over time, particularly during prior recessions. We conclude by discussing the implications of each approach for equity, particularly in light of states’ early responses to the current economic downturn.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School rezoning, or redistricting, is the process by which school boards draw and redraw school attendance boundaries. These boundaries are key drivers of racial and economic school segregation but can also work to ameliorate it. Using a critical orientation to narrative policy analysis, this study examined the cultural politics of race and whiteness in an urban school district undergoing school rezoning. Drawing on semistructured interviews with 15 school leaders and community stakeholders, findings provide a lens for school leaders and policymakers to better understand how and to what extent race is imposed in school attendance boundary decisions. Our findings expand current literature on school rezoning by shedding new light on racial narratives embedded within the political process. We conclude with policy and practice implications.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we aimed to capture the characteristics of Chinese high-quality lessons from a lesson structure perspective, specifically addressing the elements of teaching activity and their sequence. Sixteen videotaped middle school mathematics lessons were selected from 224 daily lessons collected from urban districts in five cities located in the east, north, west, south, and center of China, approved by three independent parties (based on the scores of an instruction quality assessment and ratings by two experts). We found the following five common features among most mathematics lessons: (a) most lessons began with a review; (b) pure learning of mathematical knowledge was emphasized; (c) recurrent teaching activities related to mathematics problems ran throughout the lesson; (d) highlighting and summarizing important points during the lesson and summarizing the entire lesson at the end of the class were frequently used; and (e) teaching activities were dense and large in volume. The research findings paint a broad picture of high quality instruction (deepening our understanding of high-quality teaching in different cultures) and provide multiple choices for teachers.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of providing information to families as they choose schools. Likely applicants to prekindergarten, kindergarten, and ninth grade were assigned to one of three groups. A “growth” group received lists (via U.S. mail, email, and text message) of the highest performing schools they could request. A “distance” group received lists of schools in their home geographic zone. A “control” group did not see any schools highlighted. The growth treatment led applicants to request more high-growth schools, with the strongest effects for high school choosers and families of students with disabilities. In addition, applicants’ first-choice requests appeared less malleable than their lower ranked requests. The distance treatment had only modest effects.

  Abstract
                  <p>Interest is vital for students’ learning in mathematics. Over the course of the Chinese mathematics curriculum reform in the past 30 years, cultivating students’ positive emotions, attitudes, and values has gained growing attention. In the current study we examined the trajectory of Chinese mathematics textbook development by analyzing textbook content that stimulated students’ mathematics learning interest through the curriculum reform in the past three decades. First, we selected textbooks that represent each phase of the curriculum reform (the Incubation Phase, the Reform Phase, and the Conditioning Phase). Then, taking eighth grade as an example, we used Hidi and Renninger’s model to identify content that focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. Finally, we explored the trajectory of textbook development in this aspect within the scope of curriculum reform. Results show that attention to strategies developing positive emotions and values towards mathematics has been emerging in recent times. Interest-stimulating strategies directed toward the triggering and maintaining of situational interest have been integrated more frequently into textbooks since the Reform Phase, while text content employing strategies that may lead to rote memorization is generally decreasing. Using Chinese curriculum reform as a context, this study demonstrates how mathematics textbooks have been revisioned and revised with a focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. The reform of mathematics education has been successfully implemented in more than thirty provinces in China, despite significant differences in geographical, cultural, and economic development. It is hoped that this study can provide practical evidence of interest stimulation in mathematics for the international education community.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Researchers from many countries have pointed out the difficulty of transitioning from high school to university settings, especially within the context of mathematics courses. With its abstract content, deductive thinking structure, and unique language, university mathematics is quite different from high school mathematics for students encountering such courses at the undergraduate level for the first time; often, they may perceive themselves as though they are in a different world. The two main actors playing a role in students’ transition from high school to university mathematics are the students themselves and the faculty members who are attempting to guide them through the process. This study aims to reveal the difficulties experienced by 17 to 19-year-old first-year students in the undergraduate departments of mathematics education and mathematics from the perspectives of students and faculty members. Within the scope of the study, the mathematics courses offered in the first year of a Faculty of Education program and a Faculty of Science program in Turkey were observed for one semester. Interviews were then conducted with volunteer students, as well as faculty members who were instructing the courses. We present the cognitive, epistemological, sociocultural, didactic, and affective aspects of the difficulties experienced by first-year students, as well as the reasons underlying these difficulties.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For preservice LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning) teachers, little is known about their transition from teachers-in-training to professional educators. Understanding their experiences may hold keys to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce, as well as supporting K-12 students. Rooted in queer theory and subjectivities, this critical narratological study examines a White, gay, novice high school teacher and the stories of his interactions with a White, transgender student, who was part of LGBTQ+ affinity space the participant co-sponsored. Findings demonstrate how social contexts and systems, in combination with the novice teacher’s emerging and morphing perception of professional responsibilities and boundaries were sources of consternation. Often, the participant’s attempts to circumvent, ignore, and/or thwart heteronormative assumptions and practices within the school’s environment related his sense of agency. In turn, this greatly affected much of the teacher’s subjectivities regarding student–teacher relationships. Implications highlight the important role of accompliceship and/or co-conspirators in teacher education programs and schools.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundThe Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region has notably been in the limelight of infrastructural deficit discussions over the decades. Although the region’s infrastructural development is gradually improving, the levels and pace of development remain generally poor compared to the rest of the world.ObjectivesThis study thus aims to empirically examine the roles of governance and institutions in infrastructural developments in the Sub-Sahara African (SSA) region toward addressing the pressing needs for critical infrastructures for the region.Research DesignsThe empirical strategies utilized in the study include the Common Correlated Efficient Mean Group (CCEMG) and Dynamic CCEMG methods among others. These empirical approaches were applied to analyze data on governance and institutional quality proxies for the SSA region to achieve the study’s objectives while controlling for the effects of industrial value-added, foreign capital inflow (FDI), and overall economic growth for the understudied period (1990–2019).ResultsThe results reflect the essence of governance and institutional quality as these variables significantly boost infrastructural development in SSA. In addition, industrialization and growth also show a favorable impact on the development of infrastructure thus reflecting that the transition from agrarian to industrial economies occurs in parallel with infrastructure development in the SSA. However, FDI inflows were not found to be significantly instrumental to infrastructural development in the region.ConclusionsHence, the SSA must strive to strengthen institutions and harmonize their industrial and economic push with infrastructural developments while encouraging potential foreign investors to diversify investments to infrastructural projects beyond the usual primary sector/resource-based activities.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>The give-n task is widely used in developmental psychology to indicate young children’s knowledge or use of the cardinality principle (CP): the last number word used in the counting process indicates the total number of items in a collection. Fuson (1988) distinguished between the CP, which she called the count-cardinal concept, and the cardinal-count concept, which she argued is a more advanced cardinality concept that underlies the counting-out process required by the give-n task with larger numbers. One aim of the present research was to evaluate Fuson’s disputed hypothesis that these two cardinality concepts are distinct and that the count-cardinal concept serves as a developmental prerequisite for constructing the cardinal-count concept. Consistent with Fuson’s hypothesis, the present study with twenty-four 3- and 4-year-olds revealed that success on a battery of tests assessing understanding of the count-cardinal concept was significantly and substantially better than that on the give-n task, which she presumed assessed the cardinal-count concept. Specifically, the results indicated that understanding the count-cardinal concept is a necessary condition for understanding the cardinal-count concept. The key methodological implication is that the widely used give-n task may significantly underestimate children’s understanding of the CP or count-cardinal concept. The results were also consistent with a second aim, which was to confirm that number constancy concepts develop after the count-cardinal concept but before the cardinal-count concept.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper provides an empirical exploration of mathematics teachers’ planned practices. Specifically, it explores the practice of foreshadowing, which was one of Wasserman’s (2015) four mathematical teaching practices. The study analyzed n = 16 lessons that were planned by pairs of highly qualified and experienced secondary mathematics teachers, as well as the dialogue that transpired, to identify the considerations the teachers made during this planning process. The paper provides empirical evidence that teachers engage in foreshadowing as they plan lessons, and it exemplifies four ways teachers engaged in this practice: foreshadowing concepts, foreshadowing techniques, foregrounding concepts, and foregrounding techniques. Implications for mathematics teacher education are discussed.
