  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundDuring COVID-19 lockdown worldwide, classroom education continues remotely through online. The question remains, comparing with the face-to-face education, does online education has a similar satisfaction level among the students? There are only a few studies that examine the perceived service quality of online education.ObjectiveThe study aims to analyze the factors of perceived service quality of online education during a pandemic.Research DesignA structured questionnaire elicits information from 147 students from different study backgrounds of various universities worldwide. The fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used for data analysis and model design. Research constructs evaluation for reliability and internal consistency are subsequently performed. A snowball random sampling method is applied for data collection.ResultsFindings from the fsQCA analysis identify four core factors that underpin student satisfaction through positive perceived service quality of online education. Alternative paths are determined based on gender, students’ current education status, and their loyalty toward online education. We also introduce two topologies of perceived quality regarding online education and student satisfaction.OriginalityBecause of the primary nature of the data, this is firsthand experience gathered from different universities around the world who have willingly or unwillingly experienced online learning during the pandemic. The fsQCA technique for examining perceived service quality of online education.ConclusionsThe findings contain a number of contributions, illustrating different topologies of the student from different backgrounds and their intention, satisfaction and loyalty towards e-learning, and identifying causal factors that influence willingness to recommend online education.

  Abstract
                  <p>Few and fairly limited measures of public energy literacy exist, especially in the Canadian context. We argue that more needs to be known about the public with respect to their energy-related literacy, given their increasing involvement as informants to and participants in energy systems and sustainability transitions. In this article, we describe the development and application of a public energy literacy instrument measuring three recognized domains of energy literacy (cognition, attitudes, and behaviours) in an urban setting. Existing surveys, frameworks, and models from academic and grey literature were used to guide development. Mixed methods included pretesting, cognitive interviews, and quantitative and qualitative analysis. The resulting instrument is a 15-item, 5-item, and 9-item measure of energy-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, respectively. The instrument was administered to 204 Torontonians, who demonstrated low knowledge but high attitude and behaviour scores. Results support a reliable instrument that can be used in further research as well as in the field.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In this introduction, we outline the scholarly context and research questions that motivate this special issue: In what ways do racialized constructions of school quality open up or foreclose educational opportunity? How do understandings of school quality differ across local social, political, and demographic contexts? And lastly, at what points and in what ways is the school choice process itself racialized? We then introduce the five papers in this issue, each of which challenges us to think critically about taken-for-granted notions of school quality by interrogating factors that influence “choice” beyond the usual paradigm of test scores and parental decision-making.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>School facilities are increasingly seen as essential to achieving educational equity. By foregrounding often taken-for-granted school spaces, this conceptual article seeks to situate school design within broader antiracist efforts in education. To that end, I make a few critical contributions: (a) I shift attention to the social construction and contestation of school spaces; and (b) I develop a framework for dealing with racialized imaginaries of school spaces that goes beyond conventional equity applications. Applying this framework to school design literature and planning documents, I derive a blueprint to examine minoritized school spaces that encompasses aspects of culture, wellbeing, and power.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Discussions of school integration often contrast the perceived deficits of segregated schools with the perceived strengths of schools with diverse student bodies. In this study, I examine the relationships that school community members infer between student demographics and school quality in diversifying areas of New York City. I use portraits of three New Yorkers to examine the ways that school community members reluctantly re-inscribe the stigma associated with segregated schools, assuming that the best way to improve a school is to increase its diversity. These braided discourses of pathology and diversity call into question the extent to which advocacy for integration advances the goals of educational justice.

  Abstract
                  <p>Collaborative learning has been advocated for the last several decades. However, classroom practice has indicated that this method often comes with challenges and low efficiency, suggesting the need for better support for teachers. The aim of this study is to explore teachers’ learning about collaborative learning in a professional development (PD) environment. In particular, we focused on teacher perceptions of the two aspects of collaborative learning, namely, tasks and collaboration. Teachers learned that tasks for collaborative learning should be open-ended, challenging, and feature a low floor but a high ceiling. Such tasks call for true collaboration among group members and provide a space for interactive engagement. In addition, teachers learned that true collaboration should occur in two layers, including both peer collaboration and collaboration between the PD provider (researcher) and teachers. For peer collaboration, there should be ‘deep participation’ in which every group member actively contributes ideas and engages with others’ thinking. For the researcher-teacher collaboration, the PD provider serves as the teachers’ learning partner through careful task design and facilitation of learning. Based on their direct experience with collaborative learning in this PD workshop, teachers learned about the roles of tasks and collaboration in their own classrooms. Implications of the findings and future directions for research and practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Teaching effectiveness is a core issue in educational research; however, there is little consensus about the most important results of classroom teaching from an international perspective. The effectiveness of teaching has remained a ‘black box’ for a long time. In the secondary study described in this paper we used empirical data for Shanghai taken from the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study Global Teaching InSights (GTI)—initially the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study—which was based on videotaped direct observations of classroom teaching. Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching practices on students’ interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai. While the former had a significantly positive impact on students’ general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly positive impact on students’ mathematics interest. Although specific teaching practices had no significant direct impact on students’ mathematics achievement scores, social-emotional support and instruction quality considerably influenced students’ academic performance in an indirect way via general self-efficacy.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Many girls believe they have little natural ability in computer science and girls’ perception of self-efficacy beliefs for programming is generally low. Offering engaging hands-on programming activities could be a beneficial strategy to increase girls’ self-efficacy beliefs for programming since it has the potential to offer them exposure to mastery experiences. However, a programming workshop in a museum might not offer ideal settings to promote girls’ mastery experiences in programming because of its short duration and how gender stereotypes may impact the participation in hands-on activities. In the research presented here, we explore how a science museum’s introductory programming workshop focused on robotics can impact pupils’ self-efficacy beliefs for programming related to mastery experiences, with a specific focus on girls. H1—Prior to the programming workshop, it is expected that girls’ self-efficacy beliefs will be lower than boys’. H2—Boys generally have more positive experiences with STEM activities than girls, irrespective of experimental condition. Thus, following the workshop, we predict that girls’ and boys’ self-efficacy for programming will have increased, but that boy’s self-efficacy beliefs will remain higher than girls’. In total, 172 pupils (94 girls) aged 10–14 years completed a Mastery Experiences in Programming questionnaire before and after taking part in a programming workshop. Our results show that after a 2-h programming workshop in a science museum, gender differences in self-efficacy for programming initially observed narrowed and even disappeared.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study, we investigated the literacy practices of undergraduate calculus students and non-mathematics STEM faculty members as they read excerpts from a calculus textbook. We found several differences in their practices that appeared to be tied to the didactical nature of the excerpts and the participants’ identities and power relationships with the textbook. We use these differences to explore the concept of didactical disciplinary literacy to examine the ways readers approach the process of learning from a mathematics textbook and how their practices are related to their positionality with respect to the text. We also explore the development of the readers’ thinking about the mathematical concepts and suggest connections between this development and their literacy practices. The study results have implications for the ways that mathematics textbooks can be used as resources for learning the content and literacy practices of the field.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The shift from additive to multiplicative thinking is challenging for students. A professional learning program was developed that focused on an identified area of need by teachers, namely multiplicative thinking. Program content focused on concepts underpinning multiplicative thinking, pedagogical approaches, challenging tasks, and application to classroom practice. It was delivered via six 90-min modules in 13 participating schools across terms 2–4, as part of regular after school professional learning. Whilst all staff participated, the research focus was year 3–4 teachers. Students’ historical data were collected across four years (2016–2019) to determine mean growth over time, in participating and non-participating schools. National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) and Mathematics Assessment Interview (MAI) data were used to determine the impact of the learning, as both assessments are administered annually. Analysis of year 4 students’ longitudinal data showed greater mean growth in student learning over a 2-year period in schools involved in the learning and additional in-class coaching support, than students in non-participating schools. Our findings showed that targeted school-based professional learning, with in-class support from a knowledgeable other, leads to teachers’ improved understanding of multiplicative thinking and subsequent pedagogical content knowledge to support student learning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed at investigating how preservice teachers’ understandings of division and reasoning about ratios support and constrain their formation of proportional relationships in terms of quantities. Six preservice teachers from a middle-grade preparation program in the USA were selected purposefully based on their mathematics performance in a previous course. An explanatory case study with multiple cases was used to make comparisons within and across cases. Two semi-structured interviews were conducted with each pair. The results revealed that preservice teachers who did not explicitly identify different meanings for division struggled to differentiate between the two perspectives on ratios. The results also showed that those teachers had difficulty forming proportional relationships while solving the proportion tasks. These results suggest that explicit identification of the meanings for both types of division is critical to keeping the two perspectives on ratios separate, which is a key aspect for a robust understanding of proportional relationships.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Public support to firm-level investments in innovation is one of the main mechanisms through which the European Union promotes socioeconomic convergence among regions and the creation of quality jobs is considered a necessary condition for the convergence of disadvantaged regional economies. This paper exploits the availability of natural experiment conditions and linked employer-employee microdata in Portugal to offer empirical evidence on the impact on relevant job-quality outcomes of a large EU-cohesion-policy program to support SMEs’ innovation investments. The analysis is implemented by means of stratification/coarsened exact matching model, combined with a difference in difference scheme, suitable to the specific impact identification conditions. Our results indicate that the policy intervention in Portugal had a positive impact on job-quality outcomes, with each supported firm generating an average of 4.9 additional standard-working-time jobs, +2.9 skilled jobs, and +2.0 permanent-contract jobs, compared to a counterfactual scenario of no public support. These impacts were at a cost of about 16,100€, 27,100€ and 39,400€ in public subsidies per additional job, respectively. We also estimate that the program impact was responsible for a 2.20€ (+17.8%) increase of the per-hour remuneration. These findings are robust to sensitivity analysis, in terms of alternative matching procedures and comparison groups, and they highlight the fact that increasing job-quality is a policy goal that can be pursued, at a reasonable cost, also by means of cohesion-policy support to innovation aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs.JEL classificationO1; R5; C23

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>School systems are increasingly working to foster more ambitious learning environments and disrupt institutionalized educational inequities. But such efforts are complicated by a number of uncertainties—about the aims of schooling and how they might be achieved or measured—that suffuse educational organizations. Although there is general agreement that uncertainty is both pervasive and consequential in educational settings, as a field we lack a more unified analytic framework for making sense of this uncertainty. In this article, I seek to advance such a project by drawing on educational and organizational scholarship to identify three forms of uncertainty that pervade school systems. While two of these forms of uncertainty—environmental and technical—are well established in organizational theory, I develop the concept of representational uncertainty as a third form of uncertainty that is particularly impactful in schools. I show how these three forms of uncertainty manifest across different contexts, aims, and levels of school systems; how they interrelate; and how they must be strategically mitigated or fostered in the service of educational improvement.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This systematic review examined evidence of the utility of learning progression (LP)–based assessments to inform teaching and student learning in classroom contexts. Fifty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed against four research questions. Evidence highlighted their potential for supporting judgments about learning, informing instructional and learning decisions, and improving teacher learning and development. Although 23 studies measured student achievement, reporting positive overall effects, only 6 adopted the experimental designs necessary for causal claims. Using LP-based assessment for formative purposes was well supported. Limited evidence was found regarding summative and accountability uses. Findings show that LP-based assessment design and use requires trade-offs relating to standardization and scale. Teachers need opportunities for negotiation when making judgments and integrating LP-based assessments into existing curriculum and policy contexts. Future research should examine student use of LP assessments and find a balance between standardization and customization to meet the needs of diverse learners and local contexts.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The racial/ethnic disparities and average declines in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) motivation during adolescence are worrisome. Although STEM motivational beliefs are theorized to function in conjunction with one another, the unique patterns and how they change over time for different racial/ethnic groups remain understudied. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study (N = 18,260), we identified four and five patterns of math and science motivational beliefs in 9th and 11th grade, respectively, and examined their prevalence among Asian, Black, Latina/o, White, and Multiracial adolescents. We found patterns with overall high/low beliefs, patterns with varying levels of motivational beliefs, and patterns characterized by domain differentiation. Then, we charted the stability and changes in those patterns from 9th to 11th grade for each racial/ethnic group and how the patterns at 11th grade were associated with adolescents’ STEM career expectations and high school math and science grade point averages.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Students, instructors, and policy makers are in need of research-based recommendations for supporting students’ motivation to pursue STEM fields. The present study addressed this need by examining relations between perceived motivational supports, year-long trajectories of expectancy for success and three task values, and grades among students (N = 1,021) in a large, gateway engineering course. Results indicated that students with higher motivation at the beginning of the year tended to perceive their class as more motivationally supportive. Controlling for relations between initial motivation and perceptions, perceived instructional supports for mastery goals, autonomy, and competence predicted more positive trajectories of all three task values. Conversely, higher perceived instructor performance goals negatively predicted grades and the slopes of self-efficacy and interest value. Results contribute key understanding about the interconnectedness of individual motivation and climate perceptions, while indicating the importance students place on certain motivationally supportive practices in promoting students’ STEM motivation trajectories.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Computational thinking (CT) is a set of cognitive skills that every child should acquire. K–12 classrooms are expected to provide students opportunities (tasks) to think computationally. We introduce a CT competency assessment for middle school students. The assessment design process started by establishing a cognitive model of CT domain mastery, in which three broad skill types were identified to represent CT competency. After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs. The results inform an initial understanding of typical learning progressions in CT at the middle school level.

  Abstract
                  <p>Due to rapid immigration, many children worldwide are learning mathematics in a second or additional language. This language diversity can be challenging for both teachers and students and carries profound implications for mathematics educators. Research shows that teachers use various ways to support English Language Learners. Research on multilingualism in mathematics classrooms has often focused on qualitative research. This meta-analysis aims to explore the statistically effective successful teaching practices from the studies using quantitative or mixed-method research approaches and aims to inform the research field in a cumulative manner. The specific research question that guided this meta-analysis is: What is the evidence regarding successful teaching of mathematics for Year 1–10 English Language Learners from 2009–2019 in countries where curricula are delivered predominantly in English? Four successful intervention categories were identified: Dual Language Programmes, Curriculum integration, Teacher Professional Development, and Cognitively Focused Interventions. The paper concludes with recommendations for practice and further research in this area.</p>
