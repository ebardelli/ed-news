  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 43-46, April 2022. <br> Currently, research surrounding transition programs for students entering high school focuses on academic achievement outcomes. However, the prevalence of school shootings in predominantly white, suburban communities shows that students in these often academically competitive schools may need support to help them become more connected to the school community. Antony Farag and Bailey Verdone describe how the Transition Project at Westfield High School in New Jersey, launched soon after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, has helped the school build a community of trust, beginning when students enter the school in 9th grade. The program links 9th graders with 11th- and 12th-grade who lead them in discussions about community building. The program has become an integral part of the school, receiving support from teachers, administrators, and the local community.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 47-50, April 2022. <br> The growth of school choice options such as charter schools is often understood as a way to meet the needs of under-represented communities, but concerns have been raised as to the diversity of those promoting and leading such options, as well as for the voices of those whose schooling is being reformed. Garrett Wilson and Christopher Lubienski examined governing boards in one of the most popular chains of charter schools, finding that public school boards are often smaller and more diverse with broader racial and female membership. They explore reasons for these patterns and discuss implications for democratic governance of public education.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 51-55, April 2022. <br> True reimaging of education requires us to first look back to understand why schools are the way they are, says Deborah Ball. She focuses specifically on the teaching profession and how it has become grounded in whiteness, leaving out the wisdom available among people of color. From this, she draws three lessons to take into the future: (1) The teaching profession must become more diverse. (2) Teachers must lift up Black and Brown children’s humanity. (3) Society must embrace the complexity of teaching and reject simplistic understandings of what the work entails.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 23-27, April 2022. <br> Amidst the increased demand for social justice throughout the United States, Carolyn Stoughton, a teacher in a midwestern school district, developed and taught curriculum on gender stereotypes and racial injustice to 2nd-grade students. She received messages from families suggesting her curriculum was inappropriate, pushing an agenda, and indoctrinating children. Navigating the politicized terrain of teaching for social justice is complex, uncertain, and requires a commitment to equity and a just society. Carolyn, with her former student-teaching supervisors Megan Lynch and May Lee, reflects on how she engaged with unanticipated responses from families, the impact it had on her, and implications for learning how to communicate with families.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 56-57, April 2022. <br> A 2nd-grade teacher who never cared much about birthdays made them part of her classroom routine once she saw how important they were to her students. But forgetting a student’s birthday on a chaotic Friday afternoon led her to question whether these kinds of celebrations should be her responsibility.

These schools acknowledge that students have needs that go beyond that need and attempt to address those needs and serve as a hub for the community. The current movement goes beyond providing services to include community members in their decision making. They discuss examples of what specific schools are doing and some of the challenges they face.

In so doing, it collects intimate personal information from students about their lives. Faith Boninger and Alex Molnar explain how the legal documents that govern Gradient’s retention and use of students’ data allow Gradient to retain students’ de-identified data in perpetuity and use it for unknown purposes. They explain the privacy and other threats associated with de-identified data, and warn against allowing education technology providers — particularly Gradient and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative — unfettered use of it.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 38-42, April 2022. <br> One of the most devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the increasing hopelessness and despair experienced by many students, especially those living in poverty where the lack of resources prevents them from accessing high-quality learning, health care, and social programs. Bruce Barnett describes the enormity of the problems associated with the growing hopelessness of our school-age children, some of the factors affecting students’ levels of hope, the unique role principals play in fostering hope in schools, and the skills and mindsets educators need to instill hope. This article includes examples of classroom activities that can help students become more hopeful and discusses the need for educators to become more hopeful about what students can accomplish.

Joyce Epstein and Barbara Boone report how OhSFEC’s research-based design, implementation, and evaluation of a leadership ladder has enabled state leaders to support regional, district, and school leaders as they organize and implement family engagement programs linked to schoolwide goals for student learning and development. Initial evaluation of the program shows that the policies and practices are being applied in schools, and families are seeing improvement in their interactions with schools.

Drawing on data from interviews with 30 Michigan preK teachers, Bethany Wilinski, Alyssa Morley, and Jamie Heng-Chieh Wu describe the centrality of family engagement in their pandemic preK education and the practices that contributed to stronger home-school relationships. They consider how the family engagement practices that emerged during the pandemic might be carried forward by thinking of family engagement as an improvisational practice that is co-constructed by teachers and families.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 18-22, April 2022. <br> Middle school brings rapid developmental changes for adolescents, and parent engagement is as essential as ever. However, what worked for parent-teacher partnerships in elementary school doesn’t fit so well in middle school. Adolescents are building their autonomy, and teachers must help empower parents’ efforts to bolster students as independent learners through academic socialization. The authors explore how a brief texting intervention might build trust between teachers and parents, empower parents to support their children, and contribute to students’ confidence and belonging in school. Results indicate that brief communications sent by text may bolster parent engagement efforts in middle school.

Authors have debated how much schools have historically wanted parents to participate in their children’s education, and they’ve explored how schools should respond when parents do not or cannot participate.

Robert Kim asks whether such removals violate the First Amendment and explores how much discretion court have granted school officials in removing books from schools. Cases tend to hinge on the motivations behind such removals and bar officials from removing books because they express viewpoints officials and community members find objectionable while allowing the removal of books that are vulgar, not age-appropriate, or not educationally suitable.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 7, Page 58-59, April 2022. <br> It’s understandable that federal education leaders, like Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, tend to focus on areas of broad agreement within education. But Joshua Starr suggests that they’re neglecting important stories that need to be told. In particular, education leaders need to create a new narrative that recognizes society’s collective responsibility to take care of all children, even as some in the community want to keep the focus on their own individual rights. If leaders at the top don’t speak up, local leaders may need to galvanize their own communities to shift the narrative about what schools are — and are not — responsible for. Students, like the aspiring educators in the Educators Rising program, can be a powerful voice for what schools need.

She calls on higher education programs to increase their finance offerings and shares free resources from Georgetown University’s Edunomics Lab that can help them get started.
