  Abstract
                  <p>“They are the same” is a phrase that teachers often hear from their students in arithmetic and algebra. But what do students mean when they say this? The present paper researches the notion of sameness within algebraic thinking in the context of generating equivalent numerical equalities. A group of Grade 6 Mexican students (10- to 12-year-olds) was presented with tasks that required transforming the given numerical equalities in such a way as to show their truth-value. The students initially indicated this by calculating and demonstrating that the total was the same on both sides. When asked not to calculate, their approaches evolved into more structural transformations involving decomposition so as to arrive at an equality with the same expression on each side. Students used the language of sameness—both visible and invisible—to describe the truth-value of their transformed expressions and equalities. The visible sameness referred to the resulting identical form of each side of the equality and the invisible sameness to the top–down equivalences that they had generated by their decomposing transformations—both types of sameness being characterized by their hidden numerical values. These findings suggest implications for transitioning to the algebraic domain of equations with their similarly hidden values.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>A signature item that beleaguers most teachers is classroom management. Recognizing the futility of punitive classroom management within school discipline practices, Weinstein and colleagues forged culturally responsive classroom management (CRCM). While nearly 20 years of scholarship highlights the importance of teachers employing CRCM to reduce their reliance on punitive discipline approaches, which are disproportionally skewed against students of color, there exists a gap between educational research and educational policies concerning the use of CRCM in schools. We employed a critical policy analysis to determine the existence of CRCM in student code-of-conduct policies, across all 50 states. Our findings highlight an absence of CRCM in states’ policies, and limited support for the incorporation of CRCM in schools and school districts. Ultimately, an opportunity awaits stakeholders (teachers, school districts, education preparation programs, and policymakers) to reform educational policies and the tools teachers can employ to affirm and sustain students’ learning environments.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In this paper, we draw upon in-depth interviews with teachers and administrators in 18 unionized charter schools around the country to investigate teachers’ motivations for unionization. Our results suggest that while mismanagement and distrust are often the proximate cause of charter unionization efforts, both material and purposive goals—greater job security and pay as well as increased voice in school decision-making—power organization drives and contract negotiations. Our evidence suggests unionization and collective bargaining agreements can create more transparency around pay and development, which teachers desired. But, sometimes unionization carried unanticipated risks for administrators—salaries increased faster than revenues and teacher development became constrained by newly formed collective bargaining agreements.

  Abstract
                  <p>In recent decades, there has been considerable research that explores the teaching and learning of combinatorics. Such work has highlighted the fact that understanding and justifying combinatorial formulas can be challenging for students, and there is a need to identify ways to support students’ combinatorial reasoning. In this paper, we contribute to research that explores effective ways to foster students’ combinatorial reasoning by highlighting the role that shifts in representational registers can play in supporting students’ combinatorial reasoning and activity. In particular, we present a case in which two students, aged 12 and 14, reasoned about, and developed a formula for, binomial coefficients. This occurred in a teaching experiment designed to examine their generalizing activity. In these interviews, the students first solved problems about determining the volume of a cube and then shifted to a combinatorial interpretation of this task, leveraging binomial coefficients as a way to consider growth in higher dimensions. The students demonstrated sophisticated reasoning about combinatorial tasks and were ultimately able to generate and understand a formula for binomial coefficients. In framing this case, we focus on the students’ use of different representations, highlighting the power of being able to transition between representational registers as a way of supporting students’ combinatorial reasoning. In this way, our case demonstrates the value of representational registers specifically as a mechanism by which to potentially improve the teaching and learning of combinatorics.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the last 3 years, the advocacy organization Speech First has filed six lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of bias response teams on the grounds that they violate free speech. Bias response teams are university-wide committees that respond to reports of racially charged incidents on college campuses to promote institutional goals of inclusion. These lawsuits are significant because they have resulted in the dismantling of these committees. In this commentary, we bring attention to this renewed wave of legal attacks on racial diversity and inclusion policies on college campuses and its implications for race-focused policy, practice, and research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical competitions feature in most developed countries as a part of the secondary school experience, but to a lesser extent in developing countries. In this paper we investigate how widespread these competitions are in Africa, both historically as well as currently, focussing both on national Olympiads and on the participation of African countries in competitions beyond their borders, such as the continent-wide Pan African Mathematical Olympiad and the global International Mathematical Olympiad. Since we could not find a consolidated source of information on African competitions, we include many details and links, hoping that this paper will serve as a valuable starting point for future investigators. Next, we present some survey findings on the attitudes towards and experiences of mathematical competitions, both from the perspective of teachers in secondary schools as well as from secondary school students, and whether these experiences have served to improve or degrade their perceptions of mathematics in general. Among other results, we find that teachers view their students’ participation in mathematics competitions as being important, with the biggest barrier to participation being that there are not enough competitions at appropriate levels available, and that students enjoy mathematics competitions and are more likely to pursue a STEM career because of them. Finally, we present some suggestions on how this research may be taken further, and on how the state of mathematical competition culture in Africa may be improved.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The concept of function is critical in mathematics in general and abstract algebra in particular. We observe, however, that much of the research on functions in abstract algebra (1) reports widespread student difficulties, and (2) focuses on specific types of functions, including binary operation, homomorphism, and isomorphism. Direct, detailed examinations of the function concept itself–and such fundamental properties as well-definedness and everywhere-definedness–are scarce. To this end, in this paper we examine non-examples of function in abstract algebra by conducting a textbook analysis and semi-structured interviews with abstract algebra instructors. In doing so, we propose four key categories based upon the definitive function properties of well-definedness and everywhere-definedness. These categories identify specific characteristics of the kinds of non-examples of function that abstract algebra instruction should emphasize, enabling us to hypothesize how students might be able to develop a robust view of function and explain in greater detail the nature of the reported difficulties that students experience.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Peer Instruction, first introduced by Eric Mazur in the late '90 s, is a method aiming at active student participation in lectures. It includes conceptual questions (so-called ConcepTests) presented to the students, who vote on answer alternatives presented to them and then discuss their answers in small groups. As professors have been reported to implement several variants of this method, it is highly desirable to understand the specific effects of the individual elements of the method (tasks, voting, and discussions in small groups). In the present study, we focus on the role of the discussion phase (peer discussion). Our study implemented two conditions: Peer Instruction in classical fashion, and a variant, in which peer discussion was replaced with instructional explanation by a tutor. Students in a course on Real Analysis were randomly assigned to the two conditions for two semesters. As far as learning outcomes are concerned, we do not measure these in terms of voting results within Peer Instruction cycles but we are focusing on transfer in terms of results in the final exams of the two semesters. Interestingly, we found no significant difference between the two conditions. Additionally, we had positive evaluations of the use of Peer Instruction in both variants, with no significant differences between the groups either. Regarding affective variables and learning strategies, no difference in the development could be detected. As an important practical implication, these results show that both implemented variants of the Peer Instruction method are justifiable as far as learning outcomes, measured by exam results, or students’ assessment of the method are concerned. Our results put the widespread belief that it is mainly the peer discussion that accounts for the success of the use of ConcepTests into question.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Conducting experiments fosters conceptual understanding in science education. In various studies, combinations of real (hands-on) and virtual (computer-simulated) experiments have been shown to be especially helpful for gaining conceptual understanding. The present systematic review, based on 42 experimental studies, focuses on the following: (1) What is the relative effectiveness of combining real and virtual experiments compared with a single type of experimentation? (2) Which sequence of real and virtual experiments is most effective? The results indicate that (1) in most cases combinations of real and virtual experiments promote conceptual understanding better than a single type of experimentation, and (2) there is no evidence for the superiority of a particular sequence. We conclude that for combining real and virtual experiments, apart from the individual affordances and the learning objectives of the different experiment types, especially their specific function for the learning task must be considered.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>With the growing attention to the effective use of social network analysis in explaining student learning in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education, the authors explore why college students share knowledge and how they achieve their learning in a laboratory class. In particular, the authors investigate how the social capital each student builds influences individual knowledge sharing and its related learning. The authors establish a research model derived from social capital theory that explains the relational, structural, and cognitive capital the class builds. Network data from 120 students in a lab class in a mechanical engineering department in the United States were collected and analyzed to test the research model and hypotheses using the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure and UCINET. The findings show that the knowledge sharing mechanism and student learning outcomes can be explained in terms of their social capital within social networks. Last, the authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications for college student learning in a laboratory class in STEM education.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The current pandemic closed schools worldwide, tasking teachers to engage learners remotely without time to prepare. This study focuses on a professional development webinar series for English language teachers worldwide. Access to geographically dispersed English language teachers created an opportunity to gain international perspectives on teachers’ challenges, perceptions, and needs related to transitioning to remote, online teaching. We found webinars were an effective way to provide just-in-time professional development for teachers globally, particularly about engaging students, providing feedback, developing online presence, and creating activities specific for online learning environments. The main challenges teachers reported facing were keeping their students engaged and progressing in the learning activities; unequal student access to technology and the internet; and learning and troubleshooting technology. At the same time, learning new technology and online resources was also what teachers most frequently reported enjoying about remote teaching.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Preservice teachers’ schooling during their “apprenticeship of observation” has long been a focus of attention in teacher education as it is seen as influential in the development of teacher beliefs and in limiting preservice teachers’ openness to alternative conceptions of teaching. Looking through the lens of autobiographical memory, the research engaged 42 preservice teachers in semi-structured interviews exploring their talk about secondary schooling experiences. This research found that the participating preservice teachers agentically constructed nuanced schooling memories. Rather than their experiences of schooling practices imposing conceptions of teaching on them, participants were selective in encoding and recalling practices congruent with their goal of becoming a teacher. While acknowledging the important contribution of the apprenticeship of observation construct, these research findings suggest that when viewed through the lens of autobiographical memory, the construct is more nuanced than commonly presented, and, thus necessitates further consideration by teacher educators.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Families indicate that fit and safety are priorities in school selections. It is not clear, however, whether school racial composition shapes families’ perceptions of anticipated school belonging. Using a survey experiment with students and parents actively choosing NYC schools, I find that families expressed racialized judgments of belonging. Among schools that were otherwise similar, respondents anticipated feeling most welcome in schools with the highest proportion of their racial group and least welcome in schools with the lowest portions of their ingroup. Families’ race-based assessments of school quality could be a key mechanism to explain racial segregation in school choice programs.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study focused on the practice of selecting student strategies for whole-class discussions with teachers working toward a vision of instruction that is responsive to students’ mathematical thinking. Selecting strategies is one of the 5 practices identified in Smith and Stein's (5 practices for orchestrating productive mathematics discussions, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2018) seminal work on orchestrating productive mathematics discussions, but I argue that this practice has been under-appreciated and under-researched, and implementation remains challenging for many teachers. To address these issues, I explored the selecting of student strategies with two sets of upper elementary school teachers engaged in professional development focused on the teaching and learning of fractions. One set consisted of 3 teachers who had demonstrated expertise in teaching that is responsive to students’ mathematical thinking, and I explored the selecting of strategies in these teachers’ classrooms. The other set consisted of 30 teachers with varying levels of expertise in this type of teaching, and I examined their selecting of strategies during professional development activities. Findings led to the creation of a two-level framework that showcases teachers’ criteria for selecting strategies for whole-class mathematics discussions. The framework, which extends and adds a coherent structure to selection criteria currently identified in the literature, highlights considerations related to the mathematics of the strategy, the author of the strategy, and the class engagement with the strategy. The framework, which is presented through a case, was designed to not only provide guidance for the purposeful selection of strategies but also to be accessible and useful to teachers at any phase of their development in being responsive to students’ mathematical thinking.</p>

The FI for individual studies is defined as the minimum number of patients whose status would have to change from a nonevent to an event to nullify a statistically significant result. Correspondingly, the FI for meta-analyses is defined as the minimum number of patients from one or more trials included in the meta-analysis for which a modification of the event status (that is, changing events to nonevents or nonevents to events) would change the statistical significance of the pooled treatment effect to nonsignificant. Whether for an individual study or for a meta-analysis, a low FI indicates a more “fragile” study result, and a larger FI indicates a more robust result.
