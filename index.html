  Abstract
                  <p>Emotions play an essential role in pre-service teachers’ competence development, particularly in mathematics. However, the emotion of shame in mathematics has been largely neglected so far. This article deals with shameful experiences of pre-service primary school teachers during their mathematical education at school and the various effects of shame on their decision to study mathematics as a subject at university. The research consists of a qualitative and a quantitative study with 311 prospective primary school teachers who responded to a survey about their experiences of shame in mathematics at school when they were students. Results of the qualitative study emphasize the different experiences in mathematics during the school years and reveal the characteristics of these situations, for example, social exposure or competition games. In the quantitative study, pre-service primary teachers’ subject choice was analyzed in relation to their experienced shame in mathematics at school. Results reveal that shame experienced at school has effects on the initial choice in favor of mathematics at university. Implications for primary teacher education are finally discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The growing interest in classroom discourse reflects a wide recognition within the mathematics education community of the critical role of social interactions in the joint construction of mathematics knowledge. An extensive body of empirical and theoretical work has been undertaken in the last two decades to characterise the types of classroom talk that are conducive to learning. Yet, a key challenge remains for mathematics teachers to orchestrate whole-class discussions so that student responses to instructional tasks can be utilised to advance the disciplinary understanding of the entire class. This is especially the case when the mathematics task in focus is both open and cognitively challenging. Drawing upon a complementary accounts methodology, we analysed the Learner’s Perspective Study (LPS) classroom and interview data from two classrooms in the United States and Japan to explore teacher orchestration of student responses to rich mathematics tasks. Significantly influenced by a body of literature on classroom microculture in mathematics education, this paper employed two complementary conceptual tools, coherence and meta-discursive rules, to develop an analytical framework for the purpose of exploring epistemic coherence of classroom discourse across diverse settings. The findings demonstrated that both teachers’ orchestration of whole-class discussion supported the macro-structuring of students’ experience at the level of topic coherence and contextual, organisational and conceptual connectedness, whilst the meta-narratives allowed the teacher to connect their goals for mathematics teaching and learning with the ongoing classroom activities and interactions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study explores narratives about critical moments in mathematics learning written by K-8 pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) in the United States over a 20-year period. These critical moments, such as a single memorable task, course, test, or comment from a teacher, had a powerful and sustained impact on PSTs’ mathematics identities, which they carried with them as they entered the teaching profession. We classified narratives using McCulloch et al.

We also classified PSTs’ mathematics orientations as either relational (oriented toward creative problem solving and conceptual understanding) or instrumental (enacting rote procedures without meaning) (Skemp in Math Teach 77(1):20–26, 1976). Many PSTs identified a causal relationship between their mathematics orientations and narrative arcs: relational learning opportunities encouraged positive narratives, while instrumental learning opportunities either resulted in negative narrative arcs or positive but fragile mathematics identities that crumbled under minor stress. We found little variation over time in the nature and prevalence of the narrative arcs and mathematics orientations, suggesting that any changes in mathematics teaching practices over time were not reflected in students’ learning experiences.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>A challenge for prospective teachers (PTs) is to determine what students know about a topic through asking appropriate questions and being thoughtful about the wording of these questions so as to capture and reframe students’ spontaneous mathematical thinking and eventually unriddle the fuzzy boundary of students’ complex thinking. This study examined four PTs’ efforts to elicit kindergarteners’ subtraction strategies and make conclusions about their subtraction understanding. Drawing on PTs’ plans for interviewing kindergarteners on subtraction problems, interview transcripts, and reflection papers, the results suggest that PTs provided effective scaffolds, adding context to numerical problems or explaining mathematical terms and symbols as needed. However, they avoided asking problems with subtrahends greater than five, numbers above ten, and missing starts or missing subtrahends, limiting their ability to draw targeted conclusions about the students’ strengths and needs. Using effective questions allowed one PT who posed a limited variety of problems to make stronger conclusions about her student’s subtraction understanding, while asking a broader variety of problems helped another PT who used limited questions make conclusions about her student’s subtraction understanding. Based on these results, mathematics teacher educators could leverage their PTs’ strengths to either encourage multiple interviews, each targeting different problem types, or one interview with a broader variety of problem types. The results of this study further highlight the need for PTs to move beyond just asking students to explain their strategies and have them justify or represent their strategies as well.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Online collaborative and content-focused professional development (PD) is becoming an increasingly important setting for supporting mathematics teachers’ professional learning. The purpose of this study was to better understand the process by which a community emerges in such a PD setting by examining how the cohesiveness of 21 mathematics teachers’ social network evolves and associated shifts in the quality of mathematics teachers’ mathematical discourse. We employed social network analysis (SNA) to examine the evolving cohesiveness of mathematics teachers’ social network and coding procedures to examine teachers’ mathematical discourse. A key finding was the documentation of an emergent divide between participation in the core and periphery during initial weeks of the PD and then a reduced divide and emergence of a social network that resembles a community. We argue that the instructor’s pattern of participation that included distributing their interactions across the subgroups while sending a common message regarding expectations for mathematical discourse in the PD may have contributed to the community formation process. We propose the Interaction Assessment Model, which outlines an approach for PD facilitators to use SNA as a feedback mechanism to differentiate facilitation of online collaborative and content-focused PD and build online communities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Elementary and middle school prospective teachers participated in semi-structured problem posing for integer addition and subtraction. The prospective teachers (n = 98) posed a variety of different stories, but this paper focuses on the temperature stories they posed. Results include descriptions of their posed temperature stories through the lens of the various dimensions (i.e., problem types, realism, consistency, correctness). Prospective teachers posed mainly state-translation-state problem types and rarely posed state-state-distance, state-state-translation, or translation-translation-translation problem types. They often changed the structure of their number sentences. Although they posed mostly realistic and mathematically correct temperature stories, the stories compromised realism or consistency in order to use state-translation-state problem types. Coordinating of the various dimensions (e.g., problem types, consistency) when problem posing requires flexibility with problem types. This work highlights the complexity of posing temperature stories, and coordinating the various dimensions highlights the need for prospective teachers to experience problem posing. Implications for problem posing with integers and temperature are extended to all contexts that inherently support translation and relativity. In the discussion, we coordinate the different problem types with various number sentences and dimensions. Unpacking the various dimensions illuminates prospective teachers’ thinking and offers a way of considering integers and contexts.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Competitions and related activities are an essential part of mathematics education for gifted students. China has been one of the most successful countries in recent decades in the International Mathematical Olympiad. To illustrate the Chinese experience of mathematics competitions, in this paper we first present a historical sketch of Chinese mathematics competitions, then provide a comprehensive description of its pyramidal selection and training systems, including the introduction of main competitions for high school students, some examples of competition problems, and the training of students and tutors. Furthermore, to investigate the influence of mathematics competitions on contestants, an empirical study of 372 former contestants was conducted and is reported. The results showed that most of the contestants majored in mathematics or areas closely related to mathematics. Nearly half of the contestants intended to do mathematics research or work highly related to mathematics. A majority of the contestants held positive attitudes toward their mathematics competition experiences and affirmed the value of these experiences in cultivating personal interests and developing mathematics abilities. Some negative influences of competition experiences on contestants are also identified. Finally, problems existing in the development of Chinese mathematics competitions and future research directions are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In mathematical whole-class discussions, teachers can build on various student ideas and develop these ideas toward mathematical goals. This requires teachers to make sense of their students’ mathematical thinking, which evidently involves mathematical thinking on the teacher’s part. Teacher sense-making of student mathematical thinking has been studied and conceptualized as an aspect of teacher noticing and has also been conceptualized as a mathematical activity. We combine these perspectives to explore the role of teacher mathematical thinking in making sense of student mathematical thinking. In this study, we investigated that role using video-based teacher discussions in a teacher researcher collaboration in which five Dutch high school mathematics teachers and one researcher developed discourse based lessons in cycles of design, enactment, and evaluation. In video-based discussions, they collaboratively reflected on whole-class discussions from the teachers’ own lessons. We analyzed these discussions to explore the mathematical thinking that teachers articulated during sense-making of students’ mathematical thinking and how teachers’ mathematical thinking affected their sense-making. We found five categories concerning the role of teacher mathematical thinking in their sense-making: flexibility, preoccupation, incomprehension, exemplification, and projection. These categories show how both the content and the process of teacher mathematical thinking can support or impede their sense-making. In addition, we found that the teachers often did not articulate explicit mathematical thinking. Our findings suggest that sense-making of students’ mathematical thinking requires teachers to (re-)engage in reflective thinking with regard to the mathematical content as well as the process of their own mathematical thinking.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The measures of mathematical knowledge for teaching developed at the University of Michigan in the U.S., have been adapted and used in studies measuring teacher knowledge in several countries around the world. In the adaptation, many of these studies relied on comparisons of item parameters and none of them considered a comparison of raw data. In this article, we take advantage of having access to the raw data from the adaptation pilot studies of the same instrument in Norway and Slovakia (149 practicing elementary teachers in Norway, 134 practicing elementary teachers in Slovakia) that allowed us to compare item parameters and teachers’ ability estimates on the same scale. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in the mean scores between the Norwegian and the Slovak teachers in our samples and the paper provides further insight into the issues of cross-national adaptations of measures of teachers’ knowledge and the limitations of the methods commonly applied in the item adaptation research. We show how item adaptations can be refined by combining robust quantitative methods with qualitative data, how decisions on adaptation of individual items depend on context and purpose of the adaptation, and how comparability and heterogeneity of samples affects interpretation of the results.</p>

The pre-service teachers (n = 40) were randomly assigned into two groups as the intervention (n = 21) and the control (n = 19). The results revealed that the pre-service teachers who received the intervention developed all of the cognitive and affective outcomes more than the pre-service teachers in the control group (p &lt; .05). The implication of these findings is that integrating creativity-directed tasks into mathematics education college courses can better equip pre-service teachers to develop mathematical creative abilities in their future students.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Affect (e.g., beliefs, attitudes, emotions) plays a crucial role in mathematics learning, but reliance on verbal and written responses (from surveys, interviews, etc.) limits students’ expression of their affective states. As a complement to existing methods that rely on verbal reports, we explore how graphing can be used to study affect during mathematical experiences. We analyze three studies that used graphing to represent, stimulate recall, and reflect on affect. In each, students were asked to draw their perception of an affective construct, such as confidence or intensity of emotion, against time. The studies differed in participant populations, target affect, timescales of participant experience, and structural features of the graphs. The affordances of graphing include reduced dependence on verbal data, temporal ordering of participants’ recollections, explicit representation of change over time, and the creation of objects (the graph) for discussion. These studies as examples show that well-structured graphing can productively supplement existing methods for studying affect in mathematics education, as a different medium through which students can communicate their experience.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>We are interested in understanding how university students learn to use programming as a tool for “authentic” mathematical investigations (i.e., similar to how some mathematicians use programming in their research work). The theoretical perspective of the instrumental approach offers a way of interpreting this learning in terms of development of schemes by students; these development processes are called instrumental geneses. Nevertheless, how these schemes evolve has not been fully explained. In this paper, we propose to enrich the theoretical frame of the instrumental approach by a model of scheme evolution and to use this new approach to investigate learning to use programming for pure and applied mathematics investigation projects at the university level. We examine the case of one student completing four investigation projects as part of a course workload. We analyze the productive and constructive aspects of the student’s activity and the dynamic aspect of the instrumental geneses by identifying the mobilization and evolution of schemes. We argue that our approach constitutes a new theoretical and methodological contribution deepening the understanding of students’ instrumented learning processes. Identifying instrumented schemes illuminates in particular how mathematical knowledge and programming knowledge are combined. The analysis in terms of scheme evolutions reveals which characteristics of the situations lead to such evolutions and can thus inform the design of teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Originating from the learning sciences community, design-based research (DBR) is attracting interest from many educational researchers including those focused on mathematics. Beyond its research role, it is being seen as a collaborative way to engage teachers in deep professional development leading not only to changes in skill but also in purpose. Previous reviews of the approach, however, have offered only cautious optimism for the capacity of DBR to support widespread or scalable change. This paper will use methods drawn from the digital humanities and social sciences to explore patterns relating to regional differences, theoretical underpinnings, practical implementation and methodological choice in recent DBR research in the domain of mathematics education. The findings suggest that much of the work presented as DBR might be better characterized as ‘implementation studies’ as they contain only limited commitment to theoretical development capable of supporting the scaling of innovation. The exceptions appear to occur in settings with well-developed research capacity which recognizes the need for ontological innovation of theory whilst iteratively and comprehensively exploring the complexities of authentic learning interventions. An example of a rich mathematical research study using DBR is provided to point to the potential for this methodology to achieve its overarching aims more fully.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In the age of artificial intelligence where standard problems are increasingly processed by computers, creative problem solving, the ability to think outside the box is in high demand. Collaboration is also increasingly significant, which makes creative collaboration an important twenty-first-century skill. In the research described in this paper, we investigated students’ collaborative creative process in mathematics and explored the collaborative creative process in its phases. Since little is known about the collaborative creative process, we conducted an explorative case study, where two students jointly worked on a multiple solution task. For in-depth insight into the dyad’s collaborative creative process, we used a novel research design in mathematics education, DUET SRI: both students wore eye-tracking glasses during their collaborative work for dual eye-tracking (DUET) and they each participated in a subsequent stimulated recall interview (SRI) where eye-tracking videos from their joint work served as stimulus. Using an inductive data analysis method, we then identified the phases of the students’ collaborative creative process. We found that the collaborative creative process and its phases had similarities to those previously found for solo creative work, yet the process was more complex and volatile and involved different branches. Based on our findings, we present a tentative model of the dyad’s collaborative process in its phases, which can help researchers and educators trace and foster the collaborative creative process more effectively.</p>
