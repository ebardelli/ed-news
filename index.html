          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Previous studies have applied interview-oriented self-reported or peer-centered evaluation methods, rather than an objective and quantitative method, to evaluate outcome of a postgraduate capacity-building program and have mainly focused on the cognitive level. Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in an international setting and report the results of the outcome evaluation for the behavioral aspect. Research Design: A case–control study. Subjects: Ninety examinees divided into 2 case–control groups: 17 program-experienced doctors and 17 control doctors in the first group, and 28 mentees of the program-experienced doctors and 28 control doctors in the second group. Measures: A six-station OSCE was implemented. The OSCE scores were measured to evaluate (1) the direct educational effect regarding learning in the first group and (2) the indirect educational effects regarding transfer in the second group. Written questionnaire and interview data were collected for qualitative analysis. Results: The quantitative results of the overall or subcomponent OSCE scores indicated no significant differences in the comparisons of the first and second case-control groups. The qualitative data indicated that the program improved participants’ medical knowledge, skills, and self-confidence, however, it also revealed limited learning environment provided by the program. Conclusions: This transnational study has demonstrated the process for introducing and successfully completing the testing of an OSCE in Laos. Discrepancy in the goals of the OSCE and the education program limited the usefulness of OSCE as an assessment tool, leading to the lack of significant differences in its results.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Indigenous education increasingly seeks to reclaim the institutions of state assimilation as spaces for the dissemination and support of localized forms of knowledge and language use and the valorization of alternative citizenship identities. In this study, I compare two schools in Ecuador to show how divergent ways of teaching Kichwa promote or reject state policies of language standardization and the kinds of citizens foregrounded by them. By comparing the schools’ approaches to teaching Kichwa, I call attention to linguistic registers as they carry out or contest predominant forms of citizenship. These examples provide a pathway to study inclusive language policies and classrooms and to understand the multiplicity of ways that citizenship manifestsin communication.

      Abstract
      
                  <p>This study investigates social, mathematical, and sociomathematical norms perceived by college students in an engineering mathematics course and examines the students’ sense of mathematics as signals of individual merit. Data sources include a survey and one-on-one interviews with 38 students. The findings help illustrate student perceptions of academic social norms in a large-lecture course represented by the acquisition model of learning in college, detached from communal and collaborative disciplinary practices. Findings provide insights into the local educational context of an East Asian country as a case study when exam-oriented mathematics is institutionalized as normalcy.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Citizenship is a contested concept that can be interpreted from different – and also conflicting – perspectives. Inspired by inclusive mathematics education, we try to illustrate what it could mean to work toward inclusive citizenship. We illustrate the idea of inclusive mathematics education, showing how deaf and hearing students can learn together. We interpret inclusive mathematics education as ‘meetings amongst differences’. This interpretation inspires us to see meetings amongst differences in a broader perspective. Such meetings can be considered fundamental to the process of establishing inclusive citizenship. We elaborate on this idea by exemplifying how meetings across national, economic, cultural and existential differences can be established in mathematics education. We conclude that, to work toward inclusive citizenship, it is important to establish dialogues across distances; to make students interested in and able to see situations and problems from perspectives different from their own; to construct tolerance as an expression of shared concerns; and finally, to challenge any form of We–Other dichotomy.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rer'>Tuesday, 21. February 2023</a> | 
        
          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Clearinghouses set standards of scientific quality to vet existing research to determine how “evidence-based” an intervention is. This paper examines 12 educational clearinghouses to describe their effectiveness criteria, to estimate how consistently they rate the same program, and to probe why their judgments differ. All the clearinghouses value random assignment, but they differ in how they treat its implementation, how they weight quasi-experiments, and how they value ancillary causal factors like independent replication and persisting effects. A total of 1359 programs were analyzed over 10 clearinghouses; 83% of them were assessed by a single clearinghouse and, of those rated by more than one, similar ratings were achieved for only about 30% of the programs. This high level of inconsistency seems to be mostly due to clearinghouses disagreeing about whether a high program rating requires effects that are replicated and/or temporally persisting. Clearinghouses exist to identify “evidence-based” programs, but the inconsistency in their recommendations of the same program suggests that identifying “evidence-based” interventions is still more of a policy aspiration than a reliable research practice.

          Abstract
                  <p>The mathematical construct of dimension is one of the fundamental ideas for developing a sound understanding of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shapes. Yet, research in mathematics education has rarely explored children’s understanding of dimension in primary education. This paper explores how year 5/6 (9 to 11 years old) children construct and negotiate their meanings about dimension while engaging in classroom interactions about 2D and 3D shapes during geometry lessons in a New Zealand (NZ) English-medium multilingual primary classroom. Transcribed data of two key moments selected from six audiovisually recorded geometry lessons are presented. The findings suggest that children may use different discursive constructions—“another world”, “different ways to go”, and “flat vs fat”—to display their meanings about dimension. The findings also suggest that children and teacher participants may use prosodic features of their languages to interactionally construct the meanings of these discursive constructions. The paper discusses these findings in light of current research literature and offers a few implications for curriculum development and future research.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Monday, 20. February 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The absence of discussions of identity that consider both subjective/personal and social aspects of identity is an important concern in mathematics education research. This paper proposes a framework to analyse the mathematical identities offered to and constructed by learners during peer interactions, by considering personal and social identities. To exemplify the framework, we discuss how two pairs of secondary school learners, who were engaged with similarly by their teachers and who performed similarly academically, interacted with each other and offered and constructed micro-identities during moments of a lesson, and macro-identities across lessons. We show that when learners were offered identities by a peer as higher, lower or equal status, they constructed their identities by affiliating with or resisting the identities offered by their peer. Their interactions and the identities that they constructed were informed by their personal identities, including their emotions when learning mathematics, and their social identities, including their choices to occupy certain roles in the classroom community.</p>
