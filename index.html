  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The authors present a systematic review of elementary school universal school-based (USB) social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions from 2008 through 2020 for two groups of minoritized students in education research and practice: students with disabilities and/or minoritized racial identities. Completed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards, in this review the authors identified 269 studies for inclusion, which reflected 107 USB SEL interventions. Eleven studies explicitly excluded students with disabilities. Studies varied widely in how disability and racial identity were categorized within and across studies and provided limited evidence of effectiveness through the use of subgroup analyses to support meaningful assessment of how students with disabilities and racially minoritized elementary school age students are benefiting from USB SEL interventions. The authors discuss the limitations of findings, education research best practices, and the minimum reporting standards necessary to ensure ability and racially minoritized youth representation in future USB SEL research.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we consider implications of the current world-wide inclusion of computational thinking in relation to children’s development of algebraic thinking. Little is known about how newly developed visual programming environments such as Scratch could enhance early algebra learning. The study is based on examples of programming activities used by mathematics teachers in Sweden, teaching students aged 10–12 years during the first two years of implementing programming in the mathematics curriculum. Informed by Chevallard’s praxeology in terms of praxis and logos, we describe, unpack, discuss and expand these activities. Core issues related to algebra found in the three activities are as follows: making implicit variables explicit; using a counter variable; and identifying parameters as a specific type of variable. Our findings show that, in addition to already identified uses of variables in early algebra, programming activities in the early years bring in new aspects and new ways of treating variables that could, potentially, enhance students’ understanding of variables and generalization, provided that programming praxis is embedded in an appropriate algebra logos.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence, attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary classrooms.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Social media is an increasingly prevalent informal learning site for mathematics teachers. These platforms offer an emotionally and philosophically supportive space for teachers who seek to address oppressive teaching practices within their school communities. In this paper, we examine interactions in a Facebook group with over 14,000 members to understand how a social media platform can be used by teachers to develop professionally. In our analysis of interactions within the Facebook group, we found teachers often use this space to seek support in combating the negative effects of tracking while also seeking support to better implement mixed ability learning opportunities. Through comments, community members encourage rehumanizing mathematics classrooms by promoting practices of creative insubordination (Gutiérrez in Teach Excell Equity
      Math 7(1):52–60, 2016).</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Longitudinal data analysis has been widely employed to examine between-individual differences in within-individual changes. One challenge of such analyses is that the rate-of-change is only available indirectly when change patterns are nonlinear with respect to time. Latent change score models (LCSMs), which can be employed to investigate the change in rate-of-change at the individual level, have been developed to address this challenge. We extend an existing LCSM with the Jenss–Bayley growth curve and propose a novel expression for change scores that allows for (1) unequally spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement occasions around each wave. We also extend the existing model to estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration (that largely determines the trajectory shape and is viewed as the most important parameter in the Jenss–Bayley model). We present the proposed model by a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation study demonstrates that the proposed model can estimate the parameters unbiasedly and precisely and exhibit target confidence interval coverage. The simulation study also shows that the proposed model with the novel expression for the change scores outperforms the existing model. An empirical example using longitudinal reading scores shows that the model can estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration and generate individual rate-of-change in practice. We also provide the corresponding code for the proposed model.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the HPM (History and Pedagogy of Mathematics) literature, the three mathematicians Henri Poincaré (1854–1912), Felix Klein (1849–1925), and Hans Freudenthal (1905–1990) are often mentioned in relation to having opinions about the role of the history of mathematics in the teaching and learning of mathematics. Such mentioning often appears without any further account of their viewpoints. In the paper, we seek to dig more deeply, asking the questions of what these three mathematicians’ views on history in mathematics education were, how they themselves expressed these, and what the similarities and differences might be. Our departure point was the known texts by the three mathematicians in which they touch upon aspects of the history of mathematics in relation to teaching and learning, or mathematics education in general. When possible, these written works were accompanied by secondary accounts. Finally, we draw perspectives concerning the issue of how the views of these three mathematicians may or may not align with some of the trends in modern day HPM research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>How can teachers refine their strategies for purposefully engaging students in mathematical discussions when students are working in groups and the teacher enters an ongoing group conversation? In three educational design research cycles, four teachers collaborated with a researcher for one year to analyse, design and evaluate strategies for engaging students in small-group mathematical discussions. The idea of noticing (Mason in Researching your own practice: the discipline of noticing, RoutledgeFalmer, London, 2002; Sherin et al. in Mathematics teacher noticing: seeing through teachers’ eyes, Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, 2011) was used to organize the findings—by paying attention to aspects in the mathematical discussions and interpreting the interactions, teachers could together refine their own actions/responses to better support students’ work. The Inquiry Co-operation Model of Alrø and Skovsmose (Dialogue and learning in mathematics education: intention, reflection, critique, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 2004) was used as a theoretical base for understanding qualities in mathematical discussions. Ehrenfeld and Horn’s (Educ Stud Math 103(7):251–272, 2020) model of initiation-entry-focus-exit and participation was for interpreting and organizing the findings on teachers’ actions. The results show that teachers became more aware of the importance of explicit instructions and their own role as facilitators of mathematical questions to students, by directing specific mathematical questions to all students within the groups. In this article, by going back and forth between what happened in the teachers’ professional development group and in the classrooms, it was possible to simultaneously follow the teachers’ development processes and what changed in students’ mathematical discussions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>While many aspects of the teaching and learning of specific advanced mathematics courses have been studied, limited work has examined mathematical themes like sameness or its instantiations across disciplines. In this paper, we explore algebraists’ collective example space for mathematical sameness. We used qualitative methods to analyze survey responses from 197 algebraists in order to identify specific mathematical concepts that the algebraists associated with sameness and relevant factors to consider when determining sameness of objects. Using variation theory, we introduce the notion of a community example space for algebraists to highlight specific dimensions of variation in sameness as well as the range of variation for each dimension through specific instantiations given by multiple participants. Dimensions of sameness included contexts, concepts, objects, properties, and qualities. These results suggest potential for building connections across levels and branches of mathematics by highlighting how different choices for each dimension of sameness can produce different instantiations of sameness.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we present a theoretical discussion on how problems issued from discrete mathematics can develop the attitudes, skills, and knowledge required for scientific mathematical activity in the classroom. We do so via the research situation for the classroom model by performing mathematical and didactical analyses of a problem issued from discrete geometry, and we present the results of a preliminary experiment conducted with Chilean students between the ages of 11 and 13. Our chosen problem asked students to tile a fixed square with a finite number of smaller squares. From the theoretical analysis and the preliminary experimentation, we conclude that this problem, and problems issued from discrete mathematics in general, can induce genuine mathematical activity in lower-secondary school students. In particular, we conclude that this problem is effective in developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes advocated in the Chilean mathematics curriculum.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Some states have enacted inclusive policies that reduce constraints and uncertainty for undocumented students, potentially changing their academic decisions and postsecondary goals. We explore shifts in continuing undocumented community college students’ course-taking before and after the California DREAM Act, which provided access to state financial aid. We use difference-in-differences comparisons with permanent residents, refugees, and U.S. citizens who were unaffected by these policies to examine policy impacts. After its implementation, continuing students increased their enrollment intensity, primarily in degree-applicable and transferable courses, and decreased coursework in career/technical education. This suggests state financial aid may have broadened postsecondary possibilities and made transfer to a 4-year institution a more viable option for undocumented students. At the same time, access to aid did not increase undocumented students’ credit loads to the level of their peers, underscoring the reality that other constraints continue to shape undocumented students’ participation in higher education.

More specially, the authors synthesized the extant research literature that utilized data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) to investigate the student-, teacher-, school-, and parent-level characteristics associated with algebra achievement and whether these relationships were consistent across students’ backgrounds (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and prior achievement). The authors have summarized the results of 21 studies across 2 outcome variables (ninth- and eleventh-grade algebra achievement) using optimal resource theory as a framework to summarize evidence-based practices for improving student outcomes.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Emotions play an essential role in pre-service teachers’ competence development, particularly in mathematics. However, the emotion of shame in mathematics has been largely neglected so far. This article deals with shameful experiences of pre-service primary school teachers during their mathematical education at school and the various effects of shame on their decision to study mathematics as a subject at university. The research consists of a qualitative and a quantitative study with 311 prospective primary school teachers who responded to a survey about their experiences of shame in mathematics at school when they were students. Results of the qualitative study emphasize the different experiences in mathematics during the school years and reveal the characteristics of these situations, for example, social exposure or competition games. In the quantitative study, pre-service primary teachers’ subject choice was analyzed in relation to their experienced shame in mathematics at school. Results reveal that shame experienced at school has effects on the initial choice in favor of mathematics at university. Implications for primary teacher education are finally discussed.</p>
