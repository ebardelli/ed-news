  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>We used multivariate generalizability theory to examine the reliability of hand-scoring and automated essay scoring (AES) and to identify how these scoring methods could be used in conjunction to optimize writing assessment. Students (n = 113) included subsamples of struggling writers and non-struggling writers in Grades 3–5 drawn from a larger study. Students wrote six essays across three genres. All essays were hand-scored by four raters and an AES system called Project Essay Grade (PEG). Both scoring methods were highly reliable, but PEG was more reliable for non-struggling students, while hand-scoring was more reliable for struggling students. We provide recommendations regarding ways of optimizing writing assessment and blending hand-scoring with AES.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To address response style or bias in rating scales, forced-choice items are often used to request that respondents rank their attitudes or preferences among a limited set of options. The rating scales used by raters to render judgments on ratees’ performance also contribute to rater bias or errors; consequently, forced-choice items have recently been employed for raters to rate how a ratee performs in certain defined traits. This study develops forced-choice ranking models (FCRMs) for data analysis when performance is evaluated by external raters or experts in a forced-choice ranking format. The proposed FCRMs consider different degrees of raters’ leniency/severity when modeling the selection probability in the generalized unfolding item response theory framework. They include an additional topic facet when multiple tasks are evaluated and incorporate variations in leniency parameters to capture the interactions between ratees and raters. The simulation results indicate that the parameters of the new models can be satisfactorily recovered and that better parameter recovery is associated with more item blocks, larger sample sizes, and a complete ranking design. A technological creativity assessment is presented as an empirical example with which to demonstrate the applicability and implications of the new models.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The important role of individual differences in affecting teachers’ involvement in and professional development through research has received little systematic attention in theoretical discussions and empirical studies on teacher research. Therefore, relying on the available literature and our proposed theoretical models, we investigated the possible links among language teachers’ Big Five personality traits, motivation to conduct research (through self-determination theory’s intrinsic and extrinsic motivations alongside the avoidance motivation construct), and teacher research involvement (TRI). Using a survey method, data were gathered from 253 Iranian school English teachers (SETs) and subjected to correlational and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses. Notably, SEM results demonstrated that Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism significantly predicted the motivational constructs which themselves predicted TRI. Moreover, the effects of these four traits on TRI were fully mediated through the motivational constructs. Implications for theory, policymaking, and professional development in the teacher research field are proposed.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates the potential of rehearsal interjections to provide opportunities for novice teachers and teacher educators to discuss topics related to teaching the practice of mathematical defining. Through analysis of video recordings of seven elementary novice teachers’ rehearsals about geometric definitions, we identified the problems of practice that initiated rehearsal interjections, the topics discussed during rehearsal interjections, and relations between initiating problems of practice and topics discussed. We found that initiating problems of practice focused overwhelmingly on pedagogical issues, with most related to aspects specific to the teaching of mathematical defining. Likewise, discussions during interjections tended to focus on definitional pedagogical topics. Although epistemic topics were mentioned, they were only conveyed implicitly and at times in conflicting manners. Moreover, few opportunities arose for novices to make sense of student thinking about definitions and the mathematics of shape. Our results illustrate ways in which the goal of improving pedagogy, although important, can overshadow learning of other aspects for teaching mathematical practice.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper stems from calls for methodological advancement in two areas of research: primary mathematics education and dialogical education. We respond to these calls from the commognitive standpoint by introducing the Grove of Realizations as a tool for capturing and visualizing individual students’ learning through collaborative work in small groups. We focus on a group of four students from a New Zealand Year 4 class (aged 8 and 9 years old), as they classified odd and even numbers and reasoned about their sums. This data is used to present the analytical affordances of the tool for (i) visualizing gaps in communication between group members, (ii) mapping their discursive development, and (iii) showing whether and how gaps are bridged within a group. The paper concludes with the discussion of the tool’s affordances and directions for further development.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article offers a critical review of the literature on how race played into the historical development of pedagogical progressivism in the late-19th and early-20th-century United States. While many historians have focused on the overt/covert racism inherent in much of progressive pedagogy as espoused by White educators, others have highlighted the ways in pedagogical progressivism supported movements toward liberation and social justice, especially when taken up by Black educators. Thus, the historical treatment of pedagogical progressivism is becoming more nuanced by incorporating the work of Black scholars, school leaders, curriculum designers, and teachers.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Histories of 19th-century U.S. education center White experiences, while formal education policy and practice pertaining to Black and Native Americans are treated as marginal phenomena that had little impact on schooling at a national level. Furthermore, current historical framings overwhelmingly analyze Native, White, and Black American education as separate entities, which conceals the political economic character of race as a relational phenomenon. To explore connections between race, school, and nation building, this review presents a relational analysis of scholarship on Native, White, and Black American education through the 19th century. In doing so, it outlines how formal U.S. education expressed, created, and adjusted racial hierarchies through the 19th century; and more importantly, it highlights how America’s education system developed in a context where Native, White, and Black American experiences were deeply interrelated. The review ends by identifying paths for new research on the racial dimensions of U.S. education during its foundational years and beyond.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the present paper I look at Edmond Halley’s reconstruction of Book VIII of Apollonius’s Conic as an example of a second-order historical text. Such texts constitute a particular class of original works whose distinction is that they present mathematicians of the past engaging with texts from their own past, as we do when we look at historical material in classrooms. Hence, texts of this kind provide us with an opportunity not so much for gaining a historical understanding of a concept, method, or theorem but for viewing another reader of mathematical texts, and, therefore, they provide teachers and students with an opportunity to reflect on themselves as readers. This, in effect, is a matter of reflecting on one’s relationship to the past. In the case of Halley, I characterize his particular relationship as ‘a moderator’ between past and present. But I also stress that his is not the only possible relationship to the mathematical past. The case of Halley, however, serves to bring out some of the alternatives. Bearing in mind this variety of relationships to the past will help teachers give shape to their own reflections and, more importantly, help guide their students’ reflections as readers of historical texts.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Policymakers’ neoliberal education reforms have altered teaching and teacher education. These neoliberal policies reframe teaching and teacher education through conceptions of standards, academic achievement, data, and accountability. By doing so, many new and experienced teachers have left the field, and this has caused many who remain to question their ability to attain policymakers’ objectives and what it means to be a teacher. Yet, little is known about the impact of these neoliberal reforms on preservice teachers. In this article, we begin to attend to this issue by examining how a sample of preservice teachers made sense of their role as teachers and the profession they are entering. We then analyze whether such sensemaking reflects policymakers’ neoliberal framing of these constructs. Based on these findings, we outline opportunities for teacher educators to work with their preservice teachers to interpret, critique, and respond to policymakers’ neoliberal reforms.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Multisite field experiments using the (generalized) randomized block design that assign treatments to individuals within sites are common in education and the social sciences. Under this design, there are two possible estimands of interest and they differ based on whether sites or blocks have fixed or random effects. When the average treatment effect is assumed to be identical across sites, it is common to omit site by treatment interactions and “pool” them into the error term in classical experimental design. However, prior work has not addressed the consequences of pooling when site by treatment interactions are not zero. This study assesses the impact of pooling on inference in the presence of nonzero site by treatment interactions. We derive the small sample distributions of the test statistics for treatment effects under pooling and illustrate the impacts on rejection rates when interactions are not zero. We use the results to offer recommendations to researchers conducting studies based on the multisite design.

We present findings from the analysis of 777 weekly coteaching reflection surveys completed by 44 secondary preservice teachers over 20 weeks of the clinical experience. The research team developed “ideal” benchmarks for the coteaching reflection prompts and analyzed the data in respect to these benchmarks to see how close preservice teachers met coplanning, coinstructing, and coassessing benchmarks. Data are reported according to these benchmarks, presenting these data for the entire cohort and by individual disciplines before providing detailed case studies for two pairs within the English cohort. Recommendations are provided for TPPs who want to use a similar coteaching reflection survey and approach to data analysis to inform more immediate pair support.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This study investigates teacher participation in a national online youth civic letter writing project through the lens of teacher civic commitments. Drawing on in-depth interviews and survey data from teachers who participated in the Letters to the Next President 2.0 project, civic commitments are articulated through civic beliefs, learning goals, instructional enactments, and geopolitical context. With a generic shared belief in “youth voice,” teachers enacted the civic letter writing project through instructional activities that included (a) choice of topic, (b) publication, (c) reading letters from other youth, (d) research, (e) peer dialogue, and (f) connections beyond the Letters project. While beliefs appeared widely shared, divergence in learning goals and enactments led to distinct learning opportunities for students. With minimal research exploring the role of teachers in student civics learning, this study provides new insights to guide teacher preparation and ongoing teacher development in the realm of civics education.
