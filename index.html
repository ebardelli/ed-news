  Abstract
                  <p>Properties of arithmetic operations are important in mathematics and play a significant role in elementary school students’ learning of mathematics. At the same time, it is quite challenging to help students learn arithmetic operational properties beyond memorization, so that they know when and how to use a specific arithmetic property. This paper reports a study containing two parts to explore students’ learning of the Commutative Property of Addition (CPA) as related to the content presentation in textbooks. Part one is to assess selected students’ performance on CPA at the end of Grade two, and part two is to explore possible contributions of textbooks to students’ performance in Shanghai. Firstly, we evaluated the performance of 41 second-graders on CPA by collecting data through a paper-and-pencil test, which was followed up with individual interviews. Through analyzing how textbooks present and organize this topic, we sought to better understand from a curriculum standpoint how students’ performance on CPA is impacted by textbooks. Results revealed that Shanghai textbooks make a positive contribution to students’ learning performance. The findings from this study help to shed light on how those textbooks aid student learning, and provide an example for further reflection on student learning of arithmetic operational properties in different curricula.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The world currently faces many globally connected and locally specific challenges that stimulate new ideas and expectations for science education. One response to these challenges has been development of visions for school science that seek to foster social responsibility in learners, encouraging them to take a critical stance towards products of science and technology while also empowering them to reduce potential harm these products have on individuals, societies, and environments. Recently, varying degrees of socially responsible science education have made their way into national and provincial curriculum documents; however, limited guidance on how to implement, critique, and adapt such visions to various contexts can stifle reform. In this article, we examined four frameworks which can support socially responsible science education, reviewed opportunities and challenges teachers feel are associated with their implementation, and used the review to provide recommendations for future interventions. We found teachers typically agree the frameworks benefit student learning by providing a context for students to use and learn science. They perceive system-level factors such as an aligned curriculum to be critical, where curricular content, competencies, and assessment requirements should reflect the aims and overall methods of the frameworks. Regardless of curricular alignment, concerns raised by teachers point to intervention strategies. They should include a focus on teachers’ context and practice, being sustained over a period that allows for deep exploration, while in collaboration with other educators or knowledgeable others. Directions for future research and policy are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>To analyze the impact of illustrations on solving mathematical word problems for primary school students, in this study we investigated systematically the functions of illustrations in terms of various presentations of texts and illustrations, and the difficulties associated with various learning materials. The characteristics of eye movement were studied with regard to the effect of split attention by using eye trackers. The results revealed the following: the presentation format of integrated texts and illustrations worked the best for problem solving under the condition of mathematical word problems with illustrations; the difficulty of the problem affected the role of illustrations; a high frequency of attention switching between texts and illustrations and longer fixation durations on the required picture provided evidence for the split attention effect using an eye-movement index. Based on these results, using more visual and verbal representations helps students solve mathematical word problems.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>From the socio-critical perspective of mathematical modeling, reflexive discussions about the nature, criteria, and consequences of mathematical models are not a natural consequence of modeling in school. This report is part of a larger study focused on stimulating reflexive discussions in practice employing constructivist grounded theory as a research method. Twenty-seven college algebra students engaged in a 3-week modeling project at a community college in the USA. Audio-recorded group discussions and written reflections were collected to determine how reflexive discussions were taking place. Analysis of students’ actions and reflexive discussions during the modeling project produced four concepts: voicing mathematics, personalizing mathematics, challenging mathematics, and negotiating mathematics. These concepts are integrated into an overall process for stimulating reflexive discussions and are conceptualized as unboxing mathematics. The overarching concept of unboxing mathematics represents one interpretation of how reflexive discussions may be constituted during modeling activities and identifies classroom mathematical practices specific to the socio-critical modeling context of this study.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In the spring of 2020, schools and universities around the world were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative lockdown affected more than 1.5 billion learners as teachers and students sheltered at home for several weeks. As schooling moved online, teachers were forced to change how they taught. In the research presented here, we focus on university mathematics professors, and we analyze how their practice, knowledge, and beliefs intertwine and change under these circumstances. More specifically, the context of the pandemic and the relative lockdown provides us with the experimental basis to argue that the new practice affected both knowledge and beliefs of mathematics teachers and that practice, knowledge, and beliefs form a system. Being part of a system, the reactions to change in practice can be of two types, namely, the system as a whole tries to resist change, or the system as a whole changes — and it changes significantly. The research presented here proposes a model for describing and analyzing what we called a teaching system and examines three cases that help to better depict the systemic nature of teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Rational number knowledge is a crucial feature of primary school mathematics that predicts students’ later mathematics achievement. Many students struggle with the transition from natural number to rational number reasoning, so novel pedagogical approaches to support the development of rational number knowledge are valuable to mathematics educators worldwide. Digital game-based learning environments may support a wide range of mathematics skills. NanoRoboMath, a digital game-based learning environment, was developed to enhance students’ conceptual and adaptive rational number knowledge. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of a preliminary version of the game with fifth and sixth grade primary school students (N = 195) using a quasi-experimental design. A small positive effect of playing the NanoRoboMath game on students’ rational number conceptual knowledge was observed. Students’ overall game performance was related to learning outcomes concerning their adaptive rational number knowledge and understanding of rational number representations and operations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>We used an assessment platform to study the potential of rich student data obtained online to influence classroom instruction and help teachers respond to students’ needs. The article focuses on technology-based formative assessment in the course of teaching a unit on quadrilaterals. We studied example-eliciting tasks, requiring students to determine the truth of a given claim and to use interactive diagrams to construct examples to support their answer. Our aim was to teach the concept of parallelogram by exploring students’ concept images and responding adequately to their submissions. A group of 11-year-old students studied the unit as part of their geometry curriculum. We used an assessment platform, which provides tools designed to monitor examples produced by students interacting with a dynamic geometry environment and to characterize critical and non-critical attributes of the submitted constructions. We present the teaching decisions made by the teacher (the first author), who used automatic feedback on the characteristics of three assessment tasks.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no time constraints.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study is part of the international survey studies on teachers’ beliefs concerning the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning, and this paper reports the findings of the thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses elicited from 287 primary school teachers and teacher trainees in Taiwan. Using the seminal social psychology theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179–211, 1991) to frame the findings, this study highlights 11 perceived barriers and 11 perceived enablers that are thought to influence the teachers’ intention to integrate children’s literature in their mathematics teaching. More specifically, we identified time constraint, lack of pedagogical knowledge and confidence, and resource constraint as being the most-cited perceived barriers, while pedagogical benefits, desire to improve teaching, and enabling social norms were identified as the top perceived enablers. Ultimately, this article offers several recommendations to address some of these key perceived barriers.</p>

In this text, I seek to capture the risks associated with utilising non-Western resources in the teaching of the dominant mathematics in order to elucidate possible types of harms that conventional mathematics education could cause to various non-Western communities. In particular, I challenge various dominant theoretical views that endorse the employment of the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of others to teach and learn mathematics, without paying similar or even deeper ethical attention to the mutual and reciprocal effects of the taught and learnt mathematics. I propose an epistemology of interrelationships; I call attention to possible harms caused by utilising the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of some non-Western communities as part of the teaching and learning of dominant school mathematics on the same (re)sources of those communities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>It is a challenge for mathematics teachers to provide activities for their students at a high level of cognitive demand. In this article, we explore the possibilities that history of mathematics has to offer to meet this challenge. History of mathematics can be applied in mathematics education in different ways. We offer a framework for describing the appearances of history of mathematics in curriculum materials. This framework consists of four formats that are entitled speck, stamp, snippet, and story. Characteristic properties are named for each format, in terms of size, content, location, and function. The formats are related to four ascending levels of cognitive demand. We describe how these formats, together with design principles that are also derived from the history of mathematics, can be used to raise the cognitive level of existing tasks and design new tasks. The combination of formats, cognitive demand levels, and design principles is called the 4S-model. Finally, we advocate that this 4S-model can play a role in mathematics teacher training to enable prospective teachers to reach higher cognitive levels in their mathematics classrooms.</p>

  Abstract

      mentative problem solving in mathematics classrooms is a crucial practice that supports important student learning goals via collaborative deliberation and consensus building, but also places substantial cognitive and affective demands on both students and teacher. In this in-depth qualitative study, we considered how students’ emotions during argumentative discourse relate to their learning of real-life functional situations, an area of mathematics highlighted in the literature as foundational yet difficult. Observations, written reflections, and interviews of six Year 9 (14–15-year-old) students’ experience of argument construction, critique, and consensus building were analyzed for insights into emotions experienced during small-group argumentative problem solving, and how various emotions might support or hinder students’ mathematics learning. The emotion of frustration was experienced frequently and was found to facilitate persistence and the correction of misconceptions, but also to hinder the learning in contributing to ongoing tension and eventual resignation. Peer critique was found to stimulate negative emotions but positive learning processes, such as seeking other ways to explain one’s reasoning, and re-evaluating one’s own incorrect solutions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study is an examination of 79 elementary prospective teachers’ (PSTs’) capacity for recognizing the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems and their difficulties in solving and presenting the process of fraction addition using area, length, and set models. PSTs completed a written task in which they represented the process of solving a set of fraction addition problems of varying complexity in terms of the sizes of the addends, the sums, and the denominators using the three models. The PSTs’ responses to the task were analyzed and clustered to identify the most salient and recurring patterns of erroneous approaches to modeling. While the PSTs recognized the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems, their actual work samples demonstrated several areas for improvement. Some PSTs had invalid answers and representations that were indicative of their misunderstanding of key concepts. Some PSTs had correct answers, but their model did not support sense-making. Additionally, some PSTs’ representations did not clearly incorporate the salient properties of the area, length, and set models. Our analysis generated implications for mathematics teacher educators regarding what PSTs need to learn, develop further, unlearn, and refine in order to effectively teach uses of representation in elementary classroom.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The school discipline literature has expanded rapidly in recent decades, yet the conceptualization and measurement of school discipline patterns remains overlooked. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analytic framework to examine school discipline patterns that encompasses school-level metrics that capture the prevalence and disparity in exclusionary discipline and regression-based approaches that examine the likelihood that students experience exclusionary discipline. We apply the framework to New York City and, based on school-level metrics, find that Black students have the highest prevalence and the highest disproportionality. Results from regression models affirm that Black students are most likely to receive office discipline referrals and suspensions and experience differential processing of suspensions for similar categories of infractions. The findings illustrate the nuances of the disciplinary process in schools and inform the consideration of a range of available analytic tools that educational stakeholders may employ to better measure and understand exclusionary discipline.

  Abstract
                  <p>As an essential community of practice which could facilitate teachers’ professional development and enrich research in teacher education, the teacher–researcher partnership (TRP) has not been sufficiently investigated in China. As reported in this paper, we conducted an empirical study on TRPs between secondary school mathematics teachers and university researchers by applying activity theory to investigate their collaboration and contradictions, through the process of co-designing lesson studies. We found four levels of contradictions, namely, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, within which the fourth one occurs less frequently compared to the other three. To ameliorate or even resolve the contradictions, it requires both sides to (1) achieve agreement on understanding the objects, (2) promote equality in communication and mutual respect, (3) facilitate transformation in identity, and (4) construct a united community. In addition, the investigation provided a depiction of how teachers learn and grow in the TRP as well as how teachers and researchers interact in the partnership, which in turn enriches both teacher education and activity theory.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Existing research examines whether studying with teachers of the same race/ethnicity affects student achievement, but little is known about whether those effects vary by timing and frequency. We use 7 years of administrative data from third through eighth graders in Indiana to estimate the heterogenous links between same race/ethnicity teachers and achievement by school level (i.e., elementary vs. middle schools) and self-contained classroom (i.e., self-contained vs. departmentalized classrooms). We find that the positive links between same race/ethnicity teachers and improved achievement are stronger for elementary school students and students in self-contained classrooms, particularly for Black students. Our findings highlight the importance of timing and frequent exposure to same race/ethnicity teachers in academic trajectories.
