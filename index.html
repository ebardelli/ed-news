  Abstract
                    <p>The article focuses on rehearsals as part of a practice-based approach to professional development. Fourteen Norwegian elementary in-service teachers (ISTs) collaborate in learning cycles of enactment and investigation, where the overarching aim is to learn to enact the practices that constitute ambitious mathematics teaching. Rehearsals are an important part of these cycles. We examine the patterns of use of teacher time outs (TTOs) in rehearsals and how TTOs enable the ISTs to learn core practices of ambitious teaching. The findings reveal that approximately 60% of the time in rehearsals is spent on ISTs’ teaching and 40% on TTOs. The TTOs enable the ISTs to learn together the practices of using representations, aiming towards goals, launching problems, organising the board and facilitating student talk. The findings reveal that the participants were able to work simultaneously on multiple practices, and a recurrent theme in the TTOs is representing students’ ideas as accurately as possible whilst simultaneously considering the mathematical correctness of the representations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The successful use of lesson plans as the primary vehicle for storing and sharing teachers’ instructional knowledge in Japan has given impetus to calls by US researchers for the development of a system for sharing teachers’ knowledge through instructional products to improve teachers’ capacity to implement high-quality instruction and to build a knowledge base for instruction. These products would be created by, and for, teachers to use in guiding instruction, thus building and sharing teachers’ instructional knowledge. In this study, we try to characterize one aspect of teacher knowledge that is central in building a knowledge base for instruction, knowledge of student mathematical thinking. We analyze ten written instructional products from the USA and Japan to better understand what knowledge of student mathematical thinking can be shared in such products. We also look at how knowledge of student mathematical thinking is used to guide and justify instructional decisions. One key finding is that the knowledge of student mathematical thinking shared in the top written instructional products is specific to a task or mathematical topic, varied with descriptions of multiple solutions or ways of reasoning, and sufficiently detailed to make the knowledge usable for teachers.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examines how teachers’ discourse moves influence patterns of authority in the mathematics classroom. We identify changes in authority structure in one classroom taught by a primary mathematics teacher in Hong Kong. This teacher participant was one of 32 who participated in a larger teacher-intervention study that aimed to help teachers orchestrate dialogic classroom discourse for rich learning opportunities in mathematics. Previous research has investigated teachers’ discourse behaviors and authority structures in mathematics classrooms, but the connection between the two has yet to be addressed in extant studies. Our analysis shows that certain features and patterns embedded in classroom discourse can constrain or enable certain kinds of authority in the classroom. This study contributes to understanding the ways in which dialogic discourse may influence how authority is structured, including how mathematics teaching and learning are enacted through authority styles, and how the discipline of mathematics is positioned from an authority perspective.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This multi-case study examines how three elementary mathematics methods instructors, in the same teacher education program, provide their prospective teachers with learning opportunities. Qualitative data were collected through interviews, classroom observations, and artifacts. The findings suggest that the instructors’ beliefs associated with teaching philosophies influence both the content that prospective teachers have the opportunity to learn (what) and the nature of the prospective teachers’ opportunities to learn (how). Through analytic induction, three assertions were developed to understand and explicate: similarities in opportunities to learn, differences in opportunities to learn, and perceptions about the purpose of the methods courses across the three cases. Specifically, the first assertion examines how all three methods instructors focused on developing conceptual understanding and combating mathematical misconceptions for which prospective teachers most often experience opportunities to learn through representations and approximations. The second and third assertions place more emphasis on differences across the cases based upon observed instructor actions and their beliefs. This study is significant because it helps us gain a deeper understanding about prospective teachers’ opportunities to learn within one teacher education program, and therefore, may point toward what can be done in the future to better prepare teachers in elementary mathematics education and the development of ambitious instruction. Additionally, this study unpacks how prospective teachers in the same teacher education program may have varying experiences and thus varied access to opportunities to learn.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking (Jacobs et al. in J Res Math Educ 41(2):169–202, 2010) is a construct that is used frequently to understand the ways in which teachers attend to, interpret, and respond to children’s mathematical thinking. In this paper, we present our analysis of prospective elementary mathematics teachers’ (PTs’) responses to a pedagogical activity designed to engage them in an approximation (Grossman et al. in Teach Coll Rec 111(9): 2055–2100, 2009) of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking in the moment of teaching, with a focus on developing responses which extend the student’s thinking. PTs were provided two different examples of student work and a series of questions designed to elicit information about their ability to professionally notice student work. We present data and analysis of 73 PTs’ abilities to engage in the individual skills associated with noticing as well as their abilities to use the skills cohesively in concert. Our results demonstrate the type of representation used determined PTs’ success in all three facets of noticing, with a particular effect on interpreting. Further, our focus on a specific type of response move, along with the introduction of a scaffold for that response move, made a difference in PTs’ ability to successfully respond to student work when compared to a prior study with the same PTs (Tyminski et al. 2014). We unpack these results along with suggestions for pedagogical practice as well as directions for future research.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Equity-oriented school improvement driven by neoliberal policies focuses attention on a narrow range of inequities. Such policies fail to achieve substantive transformations that address educational constraints experienced by multiply-marginalized youth of color. We engage a critical race and intersectional feminist examination of our pedagogy in a youth voice initiative designed to facilitate multiply-marginalized youth of color participation in district policy partnership. Our analysis presents practices that were consequential for supporting youth intellectual activism in policy conversations. We propose a model for critical race intersectional pedagogy that relates these practices and underlying ideological principles to supporting expansive transformative policy partnerships.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In an effort to improve learning for young children and respond to preschool fade out, some districts are working on “PreK-3” initiatives to create better connected learning pathways for children. In these pathways, primary grades continue to build on what children learn in preschool; they also present potential implementation challenges that are not accounted for in the literature. Using conceptual tools from institutional theory and empirical evidence from a study of two school districts, we show how challenges arise as districts try to bridge the divergent and entrenched institutional systems of preschool and elementary. Our findings suggest that these systems are each held in place by their own set of regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive mechanisms that reinforce one another thereby providing an explanation for why beliefs and practices are so resistant to change. This analysis also points to practical implications that may lead to better connections and learning experiences for young children.

                  <p>This is a commentary on the ESM 2021 Special Issue on Innovations in Measuring and Fostering Mathematical Modelling Competencies. We have grouped the ten studies into three themes: competencies, fostering, and measuring. The first theme and the papers therein provide a platform to discuss the cognitivist backgrounds to the different conceptualizations of mathematical modelling competencies, based on the modelling cycle. We suggest theoretical widening through a competence continuum and enriching of the modelling cycle with overarching, analytic dimensions for creativity, tool use, metacognition, and so forth. The second theme and the papers therein showcase innovative ideas on fostering and on the definition and analysis thereof. These reveal the need for a social turn in modelling research in order to capture aspects of student collaboration and agency, as well as tensions in fostering when tasks are derived from real-world scenarios, but socio-mathematical norms come from the (pure) mathematics classroom. The third theme, measuring, and the papers therein offer insights into the challenges of positivist research that aims to develop innovative measurement instruments that are both reliable and valid, particularly in light of student group work, cultural background, and other socio-cultural aspects. Drawing on the three discussions, we go on to make recommendations for further research.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of research and popular reporting shows racial differences in school modality choices during the COVID-19 crisis, with White students more likely to attend school in person in the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021. This in-person learning gap raises serious equity concerns. We use unique panel survey data to explore possible explanations. We find that a combination of factors may explain these differences. School districts’ offerings, political partisanship, perceived risk from the pandemic, and local COVID-19 outbreaks are all meaningfully associated with and plausibly explain the in-person learning racial gap. Our results illustrate how not only policy decisions but also political leanings and individuals’ beliefs could contribute to inequality in access to learning and illustrate the need for a better understanding of the factors behind observed racial inequalities in education.

  Abstract
                  <p>Rational number knowledge is a crucial feature of primary school mathematics that predicts students’ later mathematics achievement. Many students struggle with the transition from natural number to rational number reasoning, so novel pedagogical approaches to support the development of rational number knowledge are valuable to mathematics educators worldwide. Digital game-based learning environments may support a wide range of mathematics skills. NanoRoboMath, a digital game-based learning environment, was developed to enhance students’ conceptual and adaptive rational number knowledge. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of a preliminary version of the game with fifth and sixth grade primary school students (N = 195) using a quasi-experimental design. A small positive effect of playing the NanoRoboMath game on students’ rational number conceptual knowledge was observed. Students’ overall game performance was related to learning outcomes concerning their adaptive rational number knowledge and understanding of rational number representations and operations.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of the present study is to explore strategies in enumerating units of three dimensional (3D) arrays. We analyse enumeration strategies of students in grade 3 (ages 8 to 9) in situations of cubical and spherical representations of units of 3D arrays. By exploring students’ strategies in these two situations, we find that difficulties in enumerating units in 3D arrays can be traced to difficulties in units-locating, with the consequence of applying double and triple counting. Our results also indicate that spherical units can serve as perceptual clues in units-locating and in assembling units into relevant composites. With input from our findings, we suggest research to investigate the following three hypotheses: (i) spherical units can turn students away from double and triple counting, (ii) spherical units can support students’ units-locating process and their ability to assemble units into relevant composites and (iii) teaching of enumerating 3D arrays should start with spherical units before cubical units.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This article uses 30 years of investigatory and special reports by the American Association of University Professors’ Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure to understand how retrenchment and restructuring practices have been enacted on ways detrimental to both individual and the corporate faculty. Informed by changes in the logics in higher education and broader understandings of retrenchment, we identified larger patterns of where retrenchment and restructuring in violation of academic norms took place. We further identified three main themes in the reports: Declaring Exigency and / or Launching Restructuring, Faculty Roles and Rights during Retrenchment/Restructuring, and Criteria Used in Removing Faculty. Together, they demonstrate how faculty were excluded from decisions to declare financial exigency or undertake restructuring, denied meaningful roles in enacting changes once exigency or restructuring had been announced, were targeted for removal in violation of tenure rights, and were denied academic due process.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The underrepresentation and underperformance of men of color relative to women of color within institutions of higher education have been extensively studied the past 20 years. The purpose of this study is to understand trends in how this research has been conducted rather than understand “best practices” to support this student population. To achieve this, we reviewed 153 pieces of scholarship from 1999 to 2019 using an intersectional and critical content analysis approach. Findings revealed that the bulk of scholarship involved onetime interviews for its empirical foundations, and the overwhelming majority centered the racial experiences of Black and Latinx men. In contrast, few analyses critically explored gender, sexual orientation, or social class. Additionally, scholarship that centered Asian American, Indigenous, multiracial, and trans* men of color was scant or nonexistent. Given these large gaps in the knowledge base, we offer guidance for the next generation of men of color in higher education scholarship in terms of analytical foci, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>As COVID-19 shuttered schools, it created widespread student and family needs and exacerbated challenges stemming from long-standing racial and economic inequities. Here, we examine how an evidenced-based, integrated student support intervention responded to systematically identify and address the academic and nonacademic needs of students and families in 94 high-poverty, urban schools. We conduct thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses about intervention personnel’s work in spring 2020 and triangulate findings with descriptive analyses of service provision records and mid-spring estimates of crucial needs. We find that intervention schools developed specific processes to respond to immediate needs, which included resource, academic, and socioemotional support. To accomplish this, the intervention leveraged existing processes and relationships to maintain intervention-specific practices, facilitate referrals and connections to resources, and expand direct intervention for education stakeholders. Findings elucidate practices for meeting academic and nonacademic needs that affect student learning and that may arise in future schooling disruptions.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>While the COVID-19 pandemic affected the education of nearly all schoolchildren worldwide, pandemic-related school closures did not affect all children in equal ways. Between March and August, 2020, I interviewed 31 parents of children with disabilities as part of a larger interview study of U.S. parents of children in grades K–12. In this article, I analyze these parents’ narratives about their families’ experiences of pandemic-related remote learning to identify the particular challenges children with disabilities and their families faced with remote learning. I find that most, but not all, families struggled with remote learning, both when children’s specific needs while learning at home differed from their needs at school, and when schools failed to provide adequate accommodations and services remotely. These narratives demonstrate how children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to the type of large-scale systemic shock to U.S. public education that the pandemic has presented.

  Abstract
                  <p>We discuss classroom activity comprised of small groups of students collaboratively tinkering with programs of dynamically manipulable figural models, posing problems regarding their mathematical properties and behaviors. We analyzed data from students’ discourse taken from two classroom interventions employing a framework of creative mathematical action-in-context, in order to study student-generated ideas. We approached students' actions taking a fallible mathematics epistemological approach and employed constructionist and social creativity theory in our analysis. Our results show that student agency in the disciplined field of mathematical thinking need not curtail the potential for undisciplined creative action: on the contrary, given appropriate tools and discursive environments it may in fact create space for actions with creative potential for students. On their own accord, the students in the study used generalized number theory to resolve engineering a parallelogram that can never be a rectangle, and used recursion to program a model embedding geometrical progression in order to create a spiral based on the golden ratio.</p>
