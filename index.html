  Abstract
                  <p>In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created by the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18 million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals are distributed to public school students. In the following year these students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of boys. This distinction is accentuated with the age of the students and in the grades of students in the upper percentiles of the exam.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling, along with the educational discourse surrounding these, have many connections. However, ways that the educational discourse on discrete mathematics can benefit from the inclusion of examples of mathematical modelling and the accompanying discussion are currently under-researched. In this paper, we elaborate on the educational potential of examples of mathematical modelling based on the usage of methods from discrete mathematics, with a focus on secondary education. We first describe vertex-edge graphs as possible topics of discrete mathematics that are accessible at school level within modelling lessons. Secondly, in the context of a case study, we describe modelling activities with students at the end of lower-secondary education, using a classical problem of discrete mathematics originating from the Königsberg bridge problem. The students’ solution processes for this optimisation problem based on graph theory are described. Their approaches are examined referring to the phases of the modelling cycle, using the method of qualitative content analysis. We studied in particular the extent to which students use concepts related to vertex-edge graphs in specific sub-phases of the modelling process. The analysis allows the required sub-competences of modelling to be identified and the connection of these competences with discrete mathematics to be worked out. On the basis of this analysis, educational opportunities of teaching discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling are assessed. Overall, we point out the possibilities and opportunities for using examples from the field of discrete mathematics to acquire modelling competences and to foster the linkage of mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics at school level.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past several decades, housing costs have risen sharply, and as a result, an increasing number of families have become “housing cost burdened,” paying more than one third of their income toward rent and utilities. This integrative literature synthesis considers the known and potential impacts of families’ housing affordability problems on child development and schooling outcomes through a review of 64 studies published between 2000 and 2020. The synthesis proceeds in three sections: the first section examines research on the direct connection between affordability and child outcomes. The second section considers the empirical evidence on four pathways through which affordability problems are theorized to affect child outcomes: the residential mobility pathway (by causing residential mobility, school mobility, eviction, or homelessness), the living environment pathway (by reducing the quality of housing or living conditions), the neighborhood and school opportunity pathway (by restricting access to high-opportunity neighborhoods and schools), and the parental resources pathway (by reducing financial resources that could be invested in children and increasing parental stress). The third section of the synthesis considers affordability’s impact on children through an examination of the research literature on the impact of federal housing assistance. Future directions for policy are considered, including the expansion of housing assistance for families, and additional research is urged on the impacts of housing affordability on children by scholars within the field of education.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The objective of this study is to measure the effects of state aid distributed to private enterprises in North Macedonia on the enterprises’ efficiency. We examine the governmental Plan for Economic Growth (PEG) pursued through the Financial Support of Investment Law (FSIL) and the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development (FITD). We rely on a rigorous impact evaluation method, whereby comparison groups are sourced from the pool of rejected applicants for the two programs. We pursue conditional matching on firms’ observables and then apply the difference-in-differences method to isolate the effect of the subsidy. FSIL State Aid showed largely ineffective, with producing hardly any difference in sales, investment, wages, or profits among recipients, except employment. These results demonstrate the absence of the incentive effect as it relates to FSIL state aid. On the other hand, the FITD State Aid showed to be considerably effective, as the recipients were found to have increased their sales revenue and their investment in technology and profits, corroborating the presence of the incentive effect as it relates to FITD state aid. Notwithstanding the legitimacy of the policy objective to equalize domestic and foreign firms in terms of their access to state aid, these findings document partial failure of the PEG to do so due to its structural problems.JEL classification: H25, C90

  Action Research, Volume 20, Issue 1, Page 10-26, March 2022. <br>This article explores how imaginal knowing can contribute to learning and action research. I relate this to a need for organizations to learn differently for bringing sustainable results that nourish the world. I position imaginal knowing as a reflexive way of being, which informs awareness beyond language and discourse. An arts-based researcher, my paintings are imaginal reflections of lived experience. I found how engaging with the imaginal enables a more profound presence with that experience. This process, which I refer to as growth-in-connection, can generate unexpected insights and learning. For me, artistically expressing imagination became a reflexive practice to deepen understanding and voice. This article consists of a practice-based strand where I share drawings, paintings, and an inquiry into client work. In the other strand, I explore theoretical ideas from Art-Based Method, Critical thinking, Reflexivity and Action Research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Proof by mathematical induction poses a persistent challenge for students enrolled in proofs-based mathematics courses. Prior research indicates a number of related factors that contribute to the challenge, and suggests fruitful instructional approaches to support students in meeting that challenge. In particular, researchers have suggested quasi-induction as an intuitive approach to understanding the role of the inductive implication. However, a cognitive gap remains in transitioning to formal proof by induction. The gap includes the cognitive demand of quantification and the danger of inadvertently assuming what one is trying to prove. Informed by prior research, we designed instruction that builds from students’ conceptualizations of logical implication, utilizes quasi-induction, and introduces a novel set of tasks designed to bridge the gap that remains. We studied this research-based instructional design within two sections of an Introduction to Proofs course at a large public four-year university in the southeastern United States. Our findings, presented as themes, bring together extant literature and highlight nuances not previously reported, particularly regarding reasons students appear to conflate the assumption of the statement to be proved with the assumption of the inductive hypothesis. For instance, quantification of the inductive implication and the inductive assumption require careful use of language, using terms that may seem ambiguous to students, outside of mathematical convention. We conclude with a discussion of links between the Principle of Universal Generalization and mathematical induction.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study the research was focused on the mechanisms of how Chinese in-service teachers’ beliefs about mathematics, together with their professional knowledge, affect their teaching approaches. With a quantitative survey study involving 92 in-service teachers, it identified six types of teachers with three different categories of beliefs (i.e., Instrumentalist, Platonist, and Problem-solving oriented) and two different levels (i.e., strong and limited) of subject knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge on the topic of functions. Six teachers were subsequently selected, for a detailed analysis of how the teachers’ beliefs and knowledge influenced their teaching practices. The case study results showed that teachers with different professional knowledge levels about functions and beliefs about mathematics had different teaching focuses and showed different teaching approaches. Three teaching approaches were identified, including the performance-focused content-centered approach, the understanding-focused content-centered approach, and the thinking-focused student-centered approach.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The knowledge and skills that mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) need to have for teaching mathematics teaching is a fundamental issue that influences their preparation and development. In particular, considering that mathematics teaching comprises MTEs’ teaching work, do MTEs need to have school teaching experience and, if so, in what ways does school teaching experience play a role in their teaching? In this exploratory study, we describe how school teaching experience relates to teaching prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs) how to teach mathematics, from the perspective of university-based Chinese MTEs, via in-depth interviews. The interviewees generally agreed on the importance of school teaching experience by identifying various aspects of school teaching experience that relate to the knowledge, competency, and disposition needed for teaching mathematics teaching, but they also suggested that school teaching experience requires renewal, growth, and connection with educational theories and research. This suggests that school mathematics teaching experience is necessary but insufficient on its own for teaching mathematics teaching. This study also suggests the differences in capacity between teaching-based and non-teaching-based experience in understanding of and dealing with the relation between process and product, and the relation between theory and practice involved in teaching how to teach mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Cognitively demanding tasks have been shown to support students’ understanding of mathematics. How a task is launched, or introduced, determines how students engage with the task, as well as the type of work the teacher engages in during the task implementation. The authors designed a unit focused on launching a task where prospective teachers (PSTs) planned and enacted a task launch as part of their methods of teaching secondary mathematics courses. Participants in the study spanned three institutions. Using a curricular noticing framework, this paper describes how the prospective teachers (PSTs) interpreted their task by identifying key contextual features, mathematical relationships, and common language, and then focuses on how they responded to their interpretations as they planned to elicit and develop their students’ understanding of those key aspects. This paper also describes how the PSTs responded to their interpretations in planning to maintain the cognitive demand of the task. Findings suggest that the prospective teachers valued student-centered approaches and used a range of pedagogical methods to launch cognitively demanding tasks. We also found the prospective teachers needed support identifying context in tasks and in determining how much to tell while maintaining the cognitive demand of the task. We conclude with implications and suggestions for methods courses on both launching a cognitively demanding task and on teaching practices more generally.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Latinx students now make up the largest share of charter school students nationally. In this article, I focus on Latinx charter school choosers in Houston, Texas, and ask what motivates Latinx parents to exit district schools. Drawing on interviews with 31 families, I find that perceptions of present and future risk motivate charter school choice. Perceptions of present risk centered on children’s negative experiences with safety and academics and parents’ negative experiences when they attempted to intervene in district schools. Perceptions of future risk focused on future district schools and relied on information from networks, observations, and the educational experiences of U.S.-born parents. Parents framed charter school choice as a strategy to mitigate risk and protect their children’s educational futures.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The two studies presented here examine the effects of teachers’ enhanced sense of meaning at work (SOM) on their burnout and engagement. In the first study, 41 teachers in two Arab schools were randomly assigned to a meaning-induction group—in which they were prompted daily to acknowledge meaningful incidents at work for 2 weeks or to a control group. Qualitative analyses focused on teachers’ daily experiences of meaningful incidents, reflecting their contribution to others. In addition, one-way repeated measures analyses of variance indicated that teachers that acknowledged these incidents reported decreased burnout and increased engagement. In Study 2, the sample comprised 60 Arab and Jewish teachers who completed daily surveys for 12 workdays. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that teachers’ daily SOM was associated with increased engagement on the following day and somewhat increased stress. Thus, the studies highlight teachers’ SOM as a resource that contributes to engagement and can be enhanced intentionally.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this case study, we investigate one teacher’s implementation of DNR-based combinatorics curriculum in their high school discrete mathematics class. By examining the teacher’s practices in whole-class discussions of two counting problems, we study how they advanced a variety of ways of thinking to support the development of a set-oriented way of thinking about counting. In particular, we find the teacher worked to build shared experience and understanding of mathematical ideas by grounding her teaching in students’ ways of understanding and leveraging students’ intellectual needs. In doing so, the teacher promoted a set-oriented way of thinking through attending to connections between sets of outcomes, counting processes, and formulas in student representations and justifications; elevated solutions employing process pattern generalization; and advanced the beliefs that counting problems can be solved in many ways and entail several types of mathematical activity.</p>

As Joshua Starr explains, failing fast isn’t really an option for public school leaders who have to seek public approval for their decisions. And in contentious times, transparency in decision making is as important as ever. Those leaders who’ve taken the time to build relationships and share their decision-making processes with stakeholders will garner trust that will help when they make decisions that don’t work out as planned.
