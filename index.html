  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we analyse a large, opportunistic dataset of responses (N = 219,826) to online, diagnostic multiple-choice mathematics questions, provided by 6–16-year-old UK school mathematics students (N = 7302). For each response, students were invited to indicate on a 5-point Likert-type scale how confident they were that their response was correct. Using demographic data available from the online platform, we examine the relationships between confidence and facility (the proportion of questions correct), as well as gender, age and socioeconomic disadvantage. We found a positive correlation between student confidence and mean facility, higher confidence for boys than for girls and lower confidence for students classified as socioeconomically disadvantaged, even after accounting for facility. We found that confidence was lower for older students, and this was particularly marked across the primary to secondary school transition. An important feature of the online platform used is that, when students answer a question incorrectly, they are presented with an analogous question about 3 weeks later. We exploited this feature to obtain the first evidence in an authentic school mathematics context for the hypercorrection effect (Butterfield &amp; Metcalfe J EXP PSYCHOL 27:1491–1494, 2001), which is the observation that errors made with higher confidence are more likely to be corrected. These findings have implications for classroom practices that have the potential to support more effective and efficient learning of mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this reflective essay, a BlackCrit lens is used to explore new and evolving possibilities for Black teachers, families, leaders, and students in ways that highlight and honor parents’ agency, expand notions of digital equity in mathematics, and preview new and re-prioritized approaches which aid liberatory mathematics, teaching, and learning spaces that resurfaced in the pandemic. Several actions reimagine the work of mathematics as building blocks for engaging the flourishing for Black communities: (1) expanding and amplifying direct networks for Black parents to share, communicate, and advocate for their own needs and spaces around mathematics; (2) making visible and amplifying our advocacy for racial justice in the content creation and representation found in current digital platforms for meeting the needs of Black communities; and the need to (3) invest in, prioritize usage of, and illuminate mathematics commercial and academic entities focused solely on creating content and centering Black (and other people’s) knowledge and experiences in mathematics for Black families.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Visual representations, such as diagrams, are known to be valuable tools in problem solving and proof construction. However, previous studies have shown that simply having access to a diagram is not sufficient to improve students’ performance on mathematical tasks. Rather, students must actively extract information about the problem scenario from their diagrams for them to be useful. Furthermore, several studies have described the behaviors of mathematicians and students when solving problems and writing proofs, but few have discussed students’ behaviors in the context of proof writing in introductory point-set topology. We present a case study of an undergraduate, Stacey, enrolled in a general topology course. Throughout a semester, we presented Stacey with several proof-related tasks and examined how and why Stacey used diagrams when working on these tasks. Based on our analysis, we concluded that Stacey’s diagram creation and subsequent use during the construction of a given proof was an effort to identify the key idea of the proof. We describe Stacey’s overall proving behaviors through the lens of a problem-solving framework and present Stacey’s use of diagrams as an aid to discovering the key ideas of proofs in topology.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate secondary mathematics teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking in the context of a professional development (PD) program utilizing modeling-based teacher investigations. The PD program was conducted with two groups of mathematics teachers from two public high schools. It included seven 1-month-long cycles, each consisting of an introductory meeting, the teachers’ classroom implementations of a model-eliciting activity (MEA), and a follow-up meeting focusing on the teachers’ collaborative investigation and discussion of students’ written work, including their strategies to solve the MEA. Findings suggested that participating in the PD program promoted the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking, albeit differently, over time. We elaborated on the components of the PD program that might have influenced the teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking. Implications of the findings on teachers’ noticing for researchers, PD leaders, and teacher educators are discussed in terms of potential directions for future research and practice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper concerns the relationship between research and governance policy in three Swedish major development projects in mathematics education: the New Math project (1960–1975), the PUMP project (1970–1980), and the Boost for Mathematics project in (2012–2016). All three projects were driven or financed by the Swedish central school authorities. Using a historical comparative method, this study deepens the understanding of how research co-exists with governance policy when preparing innovations in mathematics education. The main historical sources are official reports and governmental decisions concerning the three projects. The analysis is focused on the nature of the innovations of each project and the role of researchers in the process of creating the innovations. The analysis highlights the theories and the methods involved in those processes. The three projects are also positioned in a context of school governance policy. In Sweden, the prevailing school governing policy changed from a highly centralised governance in the 1960s to a highly decentralised governance in the 2010s. The paper concludes by discussing to what degree the researchers adhered to principles of research or school governance; in particular, the Boost for Mathematics project is considered in this regard. The relevance of the paper in relation to the emerging field of implementation research in mathematics education concerns how historical studies can give new insights about contemporary development projects in mathematics education.</p>

For each of them, the research base is empirically established by design research and intervention studies. The personnel strategy focuses on preparing teachers for innovative teaching approaches and on preparing PD facilitators for conducting PDs on the content involved. The empirical research required for creating a research base for the personnel strategy investigates what teachers and facilitators need to know about their learners (students on the classroom level, teachers on the PD level) with regard to a specific (PD) content. The main focus of the material strategy is to provide support for teachers and facilitators by adaptable curriculum materials for classrooms and PD sessions. The empirical research on the material strategies focuses on how such material needs to be constructed to ensure both flexibility and fidelity for impactful quality implementation. The systemic strategy involves considering the systemic contexts on each level and cooperating with the respective stakeholders (e.g., school principals or regional PD authorities). The corresponding empirical research focuses on the interplay of processes and systemic conditions. In this paper, we present the implementation strategies on different levels, and typical research approaches and results for strengthening their empirical and theoretical bases.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper builds on a range of traditions in educational research and design to argue, with empirical evidence, that constructing powerful instructional materials and approaches that work at scale requires a grounding in theory and a commitment to engineering practice, including rapid prototyping and multiple development cycles. Specifically, we claim that improving practice within a reasonable timescale requires replicable materials that integrate: (1) grounding in robust aspects of theory from prior research, (2) design tactics that combine these core ideas with a design team’s creativity, along with (3) flexibility in the draft materials that affords adaptation across contexts, (4) rapid prototyping, followed by iterative refinement cycles in increasingly realistic circumstances, with (5) feedback from each round of trials that is rich and detailed enough to inform revision, and (6) continued refinement on the basis of post-implementation feedback ‘from the field’. Examples of successful implementation are analysed and related to the various roles that research-based theory and programmatic research-based methods of development can and should play in the complex process of turning insights from research into improvements in practice. In contrast, we shall argue that materials which are written and published without the development processes (4) to (6)—still the great majority—lack research validity for use at scale.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Inquiry into the teaching and learning of mathematics is a central aspect of the work of both the mathematics teacher and the mathematics education researcher, yet there are profound differences between the practices and processes underlying educational inquiries within each community. These differences are known to hinder implementation of research, yet they can also become a valuable resource. This paper explores a particular model of implementation of research: mathematics teachers adopt and adapt practices and processes of disciplined educational inquiry in a co-learning partnership with mathematics education researchers. We present a narrative inquiry of a teacher–researcher community that designed and studied classroom activities aimed at encouraging students to ask meaningful mathematical questions. The data analysis, informed by the literature on boundary objects and boundary crossing, highlights how the teachers and researchers leveraged their different processes and practices of educational inquiry as a resource in their collaborative inquiry. We conclude by suggesting that informed and thoughtful attention to the differences between teacher inquiry and disciplined inquiry may support and enhance mathematics education research implementation.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>With this article, we aim to spur a conversation on research implementation in the context of collaborations of mathematics teachers and educational researchers, with a special interest in projects situated in university mathematics education. Implementation has been often discussed in relation to the education of school teachers, and we suggest that the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical apparatus that has been developed in this research area can be re-purposed to study implementation. Specifically, we propose that in collaborative projects, implementation can be construed as an interactive change-oriented process, in which teachers and researchers develop their praxeologies through interaction and joint work on boundary objects. We illustrate the usefulness of this proposal with a teacher-mathematician and a mathematics education researcher who joined forces to introduce scriptwriting activities into an undergraduate mathematics course. Drawing on the theoretical analysis and illustration, we make suggestions for future implementation studies in the context of teacher-researcher collaborations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper I explore the question of what counts as successful implementation of a mathematics professional development (PD) project at scale. Two kinds of upscale are presented and differentiated from one another: upscale of settings and upscale of values, and the link between this differentiation and how success may be defined is discussed. As part of the discussion, three models of taking a PD project to scale are described, namely replication, adaptation and reproduction, and these are tied to the degree of professional autonomy of teachers within the PD. The examination of these ideas draws on data from two PD projects for secondary mathematics teachers in Israel, that are now years after their pilot phase and still being implemented. The first project is aimed at supporting mathematics teachers in teaching mathematically at-risk students and in helping these students to succeed in high-stakes exams. The second project is aimed at enhancing mathematics teachers' reflection on their teaching practices, using classroom video as a tool. Both projects were implemented at scale across Israel, and reviewing results from these implementations enables some general insights to be gained regarding the success of scaled-up PD projects. The crucial role of PD facilitators in successful implementations is highlighted.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Implementation support strategies such as professional development (PD) are pivotal in guaranteeing the assistance that teachers need to enact mathematics teaching innovations and to secure lasting change. Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven’s (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177–211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator’s process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices. Recommendations for the education of PD facilitators in large-scale initiatives are provided.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Students’ negative affective performance in mathematics learning is a global problem, and the situation is especially challenging in high-achieving East Asian countries. Taiwan’s Just Do Math (JDM) program was launched to resolve this problem and to serve as an example of successful scaling up with regard to implementation of innovation. We developed a framework consisting of a synthesis of the literature on essentials for successful implementation and for scaling up, and applied this framework for the purpose of identification of the factors contributing to the success of the JDM program. The identified factors include the following: the development of low-complexity sources for teachers’ use and the low degree of adaptation required to sustain fidelity; the consideration of characteristics of adopters to promote innovation outside schools; construction of communication channels to ensure the dissemination of the core ideas of JDM; the feedback mechanism through which participating teachers can acknowledge the relative advantages of innovation as realized in the program; the consideration of the influence of historical, social, political, and economic factors on program implementation; and the efforts to ensure teachers’ in-depth learning, acknowledgment of the promoted principles, and the sustainability of implementation through implementation of JDM activities in regular mathematics classes.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The purpose of this study is to present the need for stakeholders to share an agreed-on Theory of Change (ToC) during the various phases of an implementation process. To this end, we draw on the Swedish Boost for Mathematics (BM), a large-scale national educational initiative, and its intrinsic ‘algebra’ instructional module. More precisely, we analyze a cohort of official evaluation reports on the BM from the perspective of a critical case study. The BM’s embedded algebra module and its associated material offer an instrumental example. This analysis relies on a selection of theoretical constructs related to Implementation Research (IR), such as (educational) innovation, value, stakeholders, degree of merit, policy dimension, theory-driven evaluation, and ToC. These theoretical constructs derive from both general IR and mathematics education research. We identify four phases of implementation, based on the analyses of the BM, namely, policy and organization, development, implementation, and evaluation. The analyses illustrate the need for alignment among these phases, associated with the endorsed, enacted, recognized and applied ToC of stakeholders. As a critical example, BM illustrates the many pitfalls of large-scale, scaled-up educational innovations—one of these being the potential failure of evaluations—owing to lack of an agreed-on ToC.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, I report the results of a study of a large-scale implementation of an evidence-based, objective-oriented approach to teaching via digital platforms among mathematics teachers in Denmark. The aim of the study was to investigate how these platforms affect the work of mathematics teachers and how emergent problems in this process can be addressed from an implementation perspective. This objective was achieved by applying concepts from the theory of instrumental genesis to analyze ethnographical data of teachers’ platform usage and data from participatory workshops. The results of the study indicate that the design of platforms is likely to conflict with the needs of mathematics teachers and thus I argue for the need of addressing such issues by supporting teachers in enacting innovations rather than by redesigning them. Furthermore, in the paper I suggest that future workshop is an adequate format to support such enactments.</p>

                  <p>In this survey paper we aim to provide an overview of research on mathematics textbooks and, more broadly, curriculum resources as instruments for change related to mathematical content, instructional goals and practices, and student learning of mathematics. In particular, we elaborate on the following themes: (1) The role of curriculum resources as instruments for change from a theoretical perspective; (2) The design of curriculum resources to mediate the implementation of reform ideas and innovative practice; (3) Teachers’ influence on the implementation of change through curriculum resources; (4) Students’ influence on the implementation of change through curriculum resources; and (5) Evidence of curriculum resources yielding changes in student-related factors or variables. We claim that, whilst textbooks and curriculum resources are influential, they alone cannot change teachers’ teaching nor students’ learning practices in times of curricular change. Moreover, more knowledge is needed about features of curriculum resources that support the implementation of change. We contend that curriculum innovations are likely to be successful, if teachers and students are supported to co- and re-design the relevant curriculum trajectories and materials in line with the reform efforts and their own individual needs.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Divergent thinking (DT), which involves finding new possibilities and seeing the familiar from a new perspective, has been stressed in mathematical creativity education. However, convergent thinking (CT), which involves searching for a correct single answer, has been relatively understudied in relation to developing mathematical creativity. Moreover, how to relate the two thinking modes when facilitating mathematical creativity in daily teaching has rarely been studied. In this study, we propose a framework of dynamic interplay between DT and CT, which we call DT/CT dynamics, that characterizes the creative learning process in the classroom, and to provide an example we analyze research results from two classes from our 3-year longitudinal study with an experienced teacher, in order to demonstrate the framework. Findings indicate that there were significant differences between the two classes in how DT/CT dynamics worked with respect to three aspects, namely, authority distribution, micro-level transition, and macro-level goals. This paper provides a new integrative framework that combines extant work on the psychology of DT/CT with ongoing research in mathematics education, which offers a meaningful lens to capture the way mathematical creativity is pursued effectively in everyday mathematics classrooms. In particular, the study provides a reinterpretation of the theoretical perspectives of Tan and Sriraman (2017) on creativity and provides an analytical tool that enables an understanding of creative learning processes in everyday mathematics classrooms in relation to DT/CT dynamics.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Students’ self-determined motivation (acting out of interest, curiosity, and abiding values) is associated with higher academic well-being, persistence, and achievement. Self-determination theory posits that self-determined motivation is dependent on the satisfaction of three psychological needs (relatedness, competence, and autonomy), which are in turn facilitated through need-supportive behaviors from notable others. In this meta-analysis, conducted over 144 studies and more than 79,000 students, we sought to overview pathways to student motivation in order to verify (1) how do psychological needs rank in the strength of their prediction of self-determined motivation and (2) which autonomy-support providers (parents or teachers) are the most relevant for psychological need satisfaction in students and self-determined motivation. Results show that teacher autonomy support predicts students’ need satisfaction and self-determined motivation more strongly than parental autonomy support. In addition, competence is the most positive predictor of self-determined motivation, followed by autonomy and then by relatedness.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we report on a survey study of teachers’ perceptions of how mathematics textbooks, including broadly student books, teacher manuals, and exercise books, facilitate or hinder teachers’ teaching in Shanghai educational settings. For the study we established a conceptual framework about teachers’ teaching, partly drawing on Shulman’s model of pedagogical reasoning and action of teachers. The data were collected from a stratified random sample of 133 mathematics teachers in 13 secondary schools through a questionnaire, and follow-up interviews with 24 of them. The results revealed the following: the textbooks were highly regarded and used by the Shanghai mathematics teachers as facilitators rather than barriers for their teaching and instructional change, and the facilitation was most evident in the process of transformation and comprehension, and least evident in evaluation in teachers’ pedagogical reasoning and action; compared with student books and exercise books, teacher manuals played a larger facilitating role in teachers’ teaching; and finally, compared with teacher characteristics, school characteristics had a greater influence on the extent to which textbooks played a role of facilitation or hindrance for teachers’ instructional practice. Implications and suggestions are given at the end of the paper.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Within a global context of more standardization of teacher preparation, programs in the USA are increasingly using standardized teacher performance assessments such as edTPA to evaluate prospective teachers’ instructional effectiveness and readiness for their own classroom. This study was conducted in a state recently requiring successful completion of edTPA for initial teacher certification. Phenomenological methodology was used to examine the lived experiences of six elementary prospective teachers completing Elementary Education edTPA: Assessing Students’ Mathematics Learning (i.e., Math Task 4) during student teaching. Data were collected via 24 individual, phenomenological interviews at specific phases during the student teaching semester. Whole-Part-Whole analysis revealed the prospective teachers found themselves in a state of elusiveness as they engaged in Math Task 4. Three themes provide the structure for elusiveness, including juggling Math Task 4 in student teaching classrooms, from relying on experts to standing alone, and navigating edTPA processes. Understanding prospective teachers’ lived experiences with Math Task 4 provides insights into both needed supports for their successful completion of the task and some of the issues with a high stakes teacher performance assessment embedded in the student teaching semester.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examined elementary and secondary prospective teachers’ (PTs’) abilities to analyze a classroom lesson in order to make claims about student thinking around specific mathematical learning goals based on relevant and revealing evidence. Previous research suggests PTs have some skills in analyzing evidence but apply them inconsistently. Our goal was to describe in more detail the strengths and weaknesses in PTs’ ability to analyze evidence of student thinking. Results indicate that PTs can make some appropriate claims about student learning in a lesson transcript, but more often make overly broad and general claims. PTs were able to support their claims with specific student work but often used poorly aligned evidence. PTs also often explicitly recognized the shortcomings of evidence from the lesson transcript, but then relied on that evidence to make claims about student thinking. Finally, PTs’ background, such as number of teacher education courses completed, does not appear to strongly influence their ability to make claims and support them with evidence, though secondary PTs were more likely to recognize the limitations of evidence than elementary PTs. These results have implications for teacher educators, pointing to the importance of designing interventions to help PTs look beyond the most visible and salient features of a lesson when analyzing student thinking.

  Abstract
                    <p>Given the scarcity of studies explicitly exploring the often tacit assumption that teachers’ content knowledge (CK) is pre-requisite of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), in this study, we draw on Shulman’s conceptualization of these notions to examine their relation by content-aligning the CK and PCK measures. Toward this end, we analyzed data from a paper-and-pencil survey gauging primary schoolteachers’ CK and PCK on fractions. The data of 373 completed teacher surveys were analyzed using two different complementary approaches, with the one compensating for the limitations of the other: item response theory analysis and statistical implicative analysis. Both analyses suggested that CK could be considered pre-requisite of PCK: when the CK and PCK items were placed on the same item response theory scale in most of the CK–PCK pairs, the PCK items were more difficult than their aligned CK items; additionally, in most of the quasi-implication paths of the statistical implicative analysis, answering the CK items was found to be pre-requisite of answering their aligned PCK items. We discuss the study findings, considering their theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.</p>
