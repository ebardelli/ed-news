  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>With increased tensions and political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States, schools are facing greater challenges in ensuring support for their students of immigrant and Latinx origin. This study examined the associations between county-level immigration arrests and academic achievement, absenteeism, and measures of school climate and safety for students in the California CORE districts. Using ordinary least squares regression analyses with year, grade, school, and student fixed effects, we found that immigration arrests corresponded to declines in academic achievement, attendance, and various measures of school climate and safety for Latinx students and Latinx students who were English learners. We also find small declines in measures of school climate and safety for students who ever received special education services via an Individualized Education Program. Associations were strongest for arrests that occurred during the Trump administration compared with those that occurred during the second term of the Obama administration. Policy implications are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>The Peruvian basic education and its curriculum have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, certain trends and phenomena have emerged, which shape the new normality in society and have generated many effects on the mathematics curriculum. For this reason, it is necessary to pose the problem of sketching the orientations of mathematics curriculum for the new situation. In this position paper, I developed an outline based on a description of the problem situation, the demands that the world of work had already been making on the curriculum at the international level, and the research carried out by mathematics education. From these factors, I assert the significant role of critical mathematics education, particularly the motto of reading and writing the world with mathematics. I propose that orientations for the mathematics curriculum in basic education in the new normality should include ethical and political issues, statistical and financial literacy, digital skills as a part of a STEM approach, ethnomathematics from native people, and, finally, a problem-posing and problem-solving approach. In this list, ethical and political issues have primacy.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Maturity and citizenship in a democracy require that laypersons are able to critically evaluate experts’ use of mathematics. Learning to critically reflect on the use of mathematics, including the acquisition of the mathematical knowledge and skills required to that end, has been repeatedly postulated as an indispensable goal of compulsory education in mathematics. However, it remained unclear in how far such reflection is possible, even for the well-educated layperson in mathematics. We use different discussions in German mass media on the pandemic policy in the SARS-CoV-2 crisis in 2020 as examples with far-reaching individual and social consequences. The selected discussions build heavily on mathematical concepts such as mortality rates, casualty numbers, reproduction numbers, and exponential growth. We identify the concepts and discuss how far they can be understood by laypersons. On the one hand, we found that some mathematical models are inappropriate, which can also be determined by laypersons. On the other hand, we found uses of mathematics where ideal concepts are intermingled with complex statistical concepts. While only the ideal concepts can be understood by laypersons, only the statistical concepts lead to actual data. The identification of both types of concepts leads to a situation where the use of mathematics evades social control and opens spaces for misconceptions and manipulation. We conclude that the evaluation of experts’ use of mathematics by laypersons is not possible in all relevant cases, and we discuss possible implications of this result.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This article is a synthesis of the historical account of the ongoing suppression of Māori indigeneity (language and cultural knowledge) in mathematics education for over 100 years. During that time, Māori, the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, have been ravaged by the effects of globalisation as an outcome of colonisation, resulting in loss of property, linguistic, and cultural rights, that have been compounded by the damaging effects of diseases that have cumulatively sustained negative socioeconomic and education outcomes to this day. The COVID-19 pandemic, which arrived on Aotearoa New Zealand shores in February 2020, exposed and further exacerbated the deep inequities that already existed due to the legacy of assimilation policies. This article draws on Bourdieu’s notions of capital, habitus, and field to frame our analysis of the capacity and potential for Māori to act as agents within, and against, multiple cultural and structural pressures that have impacted the historical development of Māori-medium mathematics education, and the capacity of the Māori-medium mathematics community to cope while schools were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article reveals that despite some recent positive structural changes in response to the emergence of Māori-medium schooling in the 1980s, and partly due to the high status of mathematics educationally, many structural challenges remain. In 2020, in response to having to deliver mathematics education remotely, the Māori-medium community, including parents, teachers, and associates, used their individual and collective agency to overcome the structural barriers created by physical school closures.</p>

<div class='item-body'>

<div class='item-snippet'>

  Abstract
                  <p>We explore the responses of 26 prospective elementary-school teachers to the claim “1/6.5 is not a fraction” asserted by a hypothetical classroom student. The data comprise scripted dialogues that depict how the participants envisioned a classroom discussion of this claim to evolve, as well as an accompanying commentary where they described their personal understanding of the notion of a fraction. The analysis is presented from the perspective of productive ambiguity, where different types of ambiguity highlight the prospective teachers’ mathematical interpretations and pedagogical choices. In particular, we focus on the ambiguity inherent in the aforementioned unconventional representation and how the teachers reconciled it by invoking various models and interpretations of a fraction. We conclude with a description of how the perspective of productive ambiguity can enrich teacher education and classroom discourse.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Self-efficacy is a subject of ongoing intense research in cognitive psychology. Studies within this tradition are focused on how this agentic aspect of human functioning fits within and contributes to a network of other sociocognitive functionalities. From a mathematics education perspective, we seek a theoretical re-framing of self-efficacy that accounts for and advances thinking in students’ (lack of) learning of mathematics in the classroom. This study takes this perspective by starting with a student’s actual experiences in switches of self-efficacy states. Through a case study of a student who has a profile that matches one with low mathematics self-efficacy, I examine the contours of self-efficacy across nested mathematical domains. This nuanced view provides an alternative to static presumptions of self-efficacy models common in research reports in this area, and is in keeping with the dynamic ebb and flow of actual classroom experiences.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Narrative, first-person accounts of a collective, traumatic event preserve the authenticity of the experience and defend against inaccurate retrospective idealizations. Such artifacts allow us time to process the event, extract the lessons it has for us, and to bring these lessons to bear on our practices. I offer my own narrative here, as a practitioner and researcher, of daily experiences of teaching mathematics in the USA during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sudden perturbations to our regular educational practices expose ways in which those practices are incomplete or outright unstable. This, in turn, troubles the theories underpinning our practices. I offer my narrative as a point of communal reflection on what we do and know, and how we might do and know it better.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Using a dis/ability critical race theory (DisCrit) and critical quantitative (QuantCrit) lens, we examine disproportionate application of exclusionary discipline on multiply marginalized youth, foregrounding systemic injustice and institutionalized racism. In doing so, we examined temporal-, student-, and school-level factors that may result in exclusion and othering (i.e., placing into special education and punishing with out-of-school suspensions) within one school district. We frame this study in DisCrit and QuantCrit frameworks to connect data-based decision making to sociocultural understandings of the ways in which schools use both special education and discipline to simultaneously provide and limit opportunities for different student groups. Results showed a complex interconnectedness between student sociodemographic labels (e.g., gender, race, and socioeconomic status) and factors associated with both special education identification and exclusionary discipline. Our findings suggest that quantitative studies lacking in-depth theoretical justification may perpetuate deficit understandings of the racialization of disability and intersections with exclusionary discipline.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We evaluate the feasibility of estimating test-score growth for schools and districts with a gap year in test data. Our research design uses a simulated gap year in testing when a true test gap did not occur, which facilitates comparisons of district- and school-level growth estimates with and without a gap year. We find that growth estimates based on the full data and gap-year data are generally similar, establishing that useful growth measures can be constructed with a gap year in test data. Our findings apply most directly to testing disruptions that occur in the absence of other disruptions to the school system. They also provide insights about the test stoppage induced by COVID-19, although our work is just a first step toward producing informative school- and district-level growth measures from the pandemic period.

Guided by theories of critical data literacies and data justice, a historicized and future-oriented participatory methodological approach is used to center the lived lives and communities of participants through dialogic interviews and experience sampling method. Data were co-analyzed with participants using critical grounded theory. Findings illustrate how youth not only aimed to reveal the dynamic and human aspects of and relationships with data as they engage with/in the world as people who matter but also offered alternative infrastructures for counter data production and aggregation toward justice in the here and now and desired possible futures. Implications for studies of learning with/through data practices in everyday life in relation to issues of justice are discussed.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Drawing from a context of reception framework, this article asks the following questions: How do educators describe issues of safety and belonging in the context of a charged immigration policy climate? What practices have educators developed to support immigrant-origin youth? And, what are the relationships between educators’ perceptions of safety and belonging and educator practices? We analyze educators’ survey responses administered across six school districts in different contexts across the United States, including the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. We synthesize four domains of educator practice: signaling affirmation, building shared knowledge and capacity, finding and mobilizing resources, and creating space for conversation. Through this work, we connect the domain of safety as a perennial theme to safety as a practice. We discuss the implications of this and the need for future work that critically analyzes educators’ practice in relation to immigrant-origin youth for more generative contexts—contexts of development, not merely reception.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Student evaluations of teaching are widely used to assess instructors and courses. Using a model-based approach and Bayesian methods, we examine how the direction of the scale, labels on scales, and the number of options affect the ratings. We conduct a within-participants experiment in which respondents evaluate instructors and lectures using different scales. We find that people tend to give positive ratings, especially when using letter scales compared with number scales. Furthermore, people tend to use the end-points less often when a scale is presented in reverse. Our model-based analysis allows us to infer how the features of scales shift responses to higher or lower ratings and how they compress scale use to make end-point responses more or less likely. The model also makes predictions about equivalent ratings across scales, which we demonstrate using real-world evaluation data. Our study has implications for the design of scales and for their use in assessment.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article suggests two approaches for sharing education research based on a model of research dissemination for Twitter pioneered by the medical community. The first approach is the visual abstract that reflects a visual summary of a study’s textual abstract. Evidence demonstrates that compared with a text-alone approach, the visual abstract yields eight times as many shares on Twitter and three times as many people clicking to access the full article. The second strategy is the translational visual abstract that is designed for sharing education research with nonscientific audiences. I provide a general overview of using Twitter for research dissemination, describe each visual approach and share step-by-step design guidelines, offer recommendations for using these visuals for dissemination purposes, and conclude with future directions for investigating the effectiveness of visual abstracts and translational visual abstracts for communicating education research.

This brief uses survey data from Tennessee to investigate the underlying reasons explaining administrators’ decisions to retain low-performing teachers. The presented analysis suggests that administrators largely retain low-performing teachers due to a persistent belief that these teachers will improve with time; further analysis presents some evidence regarding observable improvement among low-performing teachers. The brief concludes with a brief discussion of implications for policy and practice.

This study explores teachers’ values as they choose one task from among three that they believe will have the most potential to occasion mathematical creativity in the classroom. Participants’ analyses of each task, as well as their reasons for choosing one task as most preferred, were analyzed in terms of task features and cognitive demands, as well as their explicit reference to fluency, flexibility, and originality. Two values shared by most participants were having several solution paths and a task that would challenge students. Of particular interest are task features and cognitive demands that were associated with a task at the initial stage of analysis but were not mentioned as a reason for choosing that task as occasioning mathematical creativity. Dilemmas and challenges regarding the study of values are discussed.</p>

As schools increasingly use student surveys to drive local policy making, respondents’ (lack of) motivation to provide quality responses may threaten the wisdom of using questionnaires for data-based decision making. To better understand student satisficing—the practice of suboptimal responding on surveys—and its impact on data quality, we examined its pervasiveness and impact on a large-scale social–emotional learning survey administered to 409,721 elementary and secondary students. Findings indicated that despite the prevalence of satisficing, its impact on data quality appeared more modest than anticipated. We conclude by outlining an accessible approach for defining and calculating satisficing for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.
