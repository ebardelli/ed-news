  Abstract
      
                  <p>Finding opportunities for elementary preservice teachers to engage in mathematics for themselves and to collaborate in their enquiries was the focus of this study, carried out at two English Universities. Preservice teachers on 1-year postgraduate programmes engaged in shared mathematics enquiry, with a focus on growing patterns. We conducted interviews with 15 preservice teachers and analysed the interview data alongside their subsequent lesson plans and lesson evaluations. We explored the awarenesses that emerged through deliberate retrospective analysis of sharing what others were seeing and how this influenced their prospective thinking about their own teaching. Our findings indicate that even when preservice teachers struggle to make sense of what others are seeing, they recognise that some approaches may be more efficient or insightful than others, and that listening to others’ ideas is a powerful learning opportunity for teachers and children. This has implications for initial teacher education programmes internationally. There is value in providing preservice teachers with opportunities to engage with mathematics as a shared experience, and in enabling and supporting deliberate retrospective and prospective reflection of this activity.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>A case study of calculus instructional material (comprising of lecture notes and tutorial practice worksheets) designed by teachers from a Singapore pre-university is presented in this paper. As textbooks have not been available for mathematics at the pre-university levels, the instructional material was a product of the teachers’ collaborative work based on their interpretation of the school mathematics curriculum. Through a study of the instructional material, the teachers’ instructional goals and their alignment to the curriculum were examined. It was clear that the instructional material was more than a mere compilation of resources for the instruction; the teachers’ effort was also in building the close connection within and across the concepts and sub-topics. The discrete parts of the content were organized under a “big idea” in the lecture notes. Anchor questions were used in the tutorial practice worksheets to facilitate students to recognize the similarity of the underlying structures of seemingly different questions. In addition to the teachers’ articulated instructional goals such as covering all the key concepts, reducing students’ cognitive load, or developing their algorithmic mastery, the study revealed the unarticulated goal as to raise the students’ cognitive growth, which could be explained by the APOS cognitive growth model. In aligning to the school curriculum, it was observed that the teachers made judgement to tap on the advantage of the spiral curriculum to advance their students’ understanding of calculus from the secondary level using a higher perspective, and to better their students’ understanding of calculus concepts in addition to focusing on algorithmic mastery. The effort to engage their students in problem-solving and the use of technology to develop higher order thinking or enhance conceptual understanding remained implicit.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many states use high-school exit examinations to assess students’ career and college readiness in core subjects. We find meaningful consequences of barely passing the mathematics examination in Massachusetts, as opposed to just failing it. However, these impacts operate at different educational attainment margins for low-income and higher-income students. As in previous work, we find that barely passing increases the probability of graduating from high school for low-income (particularly urban low-income) students, but not for higher-income students. However, this pattern is reversed for 4-year college graduation. For higher-income students only, just passing the examination increases the probability of completing a 4-year college degree by 2.1 percentage points, a sizable effect given that only 13% of these students near the cutoff graduate.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In the face of today’s urgent societal challenges, there are constant calls for regional governments to respond to them. Yet, policies, including those developed through action research, appear to be transforming too slowly. This paper focuses on love as a methodological dimension of action research that can energize these responses. One of the main features of love is that it requires mastering the interplay between reason and emotion, and I use art-based action research as a vehicle to explore this interplay. More specifically, my data in this paper are the poems I wrote when I participated in an experiment led by an artist on social media. The discussion of the case focuses on how we can use the lessons learnt in the experiment to integrate love in action research for territorial development.

  Abstract
                  <p>TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources (TRIUMPHS) is a multi-year, multi-institution collaborative project funded by the US National Science Foundation aimed at developing and testing student projects based on primary historical sources related to the original or subsequent development of core topics in today’s tertiary mathematics curriculum. In addition to developing a broad range of projects and supporting their site testing by instructors across the US and Canada, TRIUMPHS includes a major Evaluation-with-Research component that is studying the effects of their classroom use on students and instructors. Our goal in this article is to share an overview of our research efforts related to the student learning experience—and as importantly, the tale of how we arrived at them—with others engaged in the effort to transform instruction in the field of undergraduate mathematics education. We provide a summary of three research initiatives undertaken by TRIUMPHS: a metadiscursive rules investigation based on Sfard’s theory of commognition, an exploratory study of the concepts of transgressive actions and boundary crossings (first put forth by Polish psychologist Jozef Kozielecki) within the context of student learning of mathematics, and an examination of the different views students hold regarding the nature of mathematics. Additionally, we offer methodological reflections on how we revised our research questions and analytic tools based on theoretical constructs from mathematics education and beyond as the project unfolded over the first 6 years.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this survey paper we focus on mathematics learning in Chinese contexts, as a way to contribute to broader discussions about mathematical learning. We first review the features of Chinese students’ mathematical learning depicted in the literature, followed by a review of student mathematical learning in recent Chinese research journals. This leads to an introduction of the papers on Chinese students’ learning in this issue. For Chinese students’ learning contexts, we discuss four aspects, namely, classroom instruction, teachers’ professional learning, curriculum materials, and learning outside of school. For each context, we review the literature findings on the identified features, introduce emerged practices and most recent policies under the reformed era, and discuss the relevant papers in this special issue. Whenever possible, we connect findings on Chinese students’ learning with the associated contexts and relate these findings in the Chinese contexts to findings in the broader world context. We conclude this survey paper with possible lessons learned from Chinese students’ learning features and from the varied Chinese contexts. In particular, we discuss these aspects from culturally contextualized and semantically decontextualized dimensions, which is expected to facilitate broad international discourse centering on the three questions proposed at the end of this paper.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Regression discontinuity is popular in finding treatment/policy effects when the treatment is determined by a continuous variable crossing a cutoff. Typically, a local linear regression (LLR) estimator is used to find the effects. For binary response, however, LLR is not suitable in extrapolating the treatment, as in doubling/tripling the treatment dose/intensity. The reason is that doubling/tripling the LLR estimate can give a number out of the bound [math], despite that the effect should be a change in probability. We propose local maximum likelihood estimators which overcome these shortcomings, while giving almost the same estimates as the LLR estimator does for the original treatment. A simulation study and an empirical analysis for effects of an income subsidy program on religion demonstrate these points.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The schooling disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to reverberate across the K-12 educational system more than a year after schools closed for in-person instruction. In this study, we examined the aftermath of these disruptions by modeling student achievement trends prior to and during the pandemic, with particular focus on growth in 2020-2021. The data included test scores from 4.9 million U.S. students in Grades 3 through 8. Although the average student demonstrated positive gains in math and reading during the 2020-2021 school year, students were still behind typical (prepandemic) averages by spring 2021 (0.16 to 0.26 standard deviations behind in math and 0.06 to 0.11 standard deviations behind in reading). Furthermore, growth in math was more variable than in prior years, and much of the gains occurred among initially high-performing students pulling further ahead. Findings support the theory that the pandemic left students behind academically across the board while also worsening existing educational inequities.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The authors investigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk factors, suitability of online instruction, politics, and institutions’ finances as rationales guiding instructional delivery decisions for fall 2020, after COVID-19’s emergence. Contributions include estimating multinomial logit regressions with mode of delivery as a categorical variable, integrating resource dependence and crisis response as theoretical frames, and introducing new predictor variables, including a measure of local residential access to broadband Internet. Findings suggest that county populations, local political preferences, and the percentage of revenue derived from auxiliary enterprises were consistent predictors of delivery mode. Political parties of an institution’s governor and congressional representative were predictive of delivery mode for institutions in the lowest tercile of endowment per student but not for institutions in the highest tercile. Bottom-tercile institutions substituted from online to in-person reopening as reliance on revenue from auxiliary enterprises increased, but top-tercile institutions appeared only to substitute from hybrid to in-person or from online to hybrid delivery as revenue from auxiliary enterprises or tuition and fees increased.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This evaluation of faculty hiring examines how eight faculty search chairs at a border Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) discuss how they enact an HSI consciousness when making hiring decisions. Using a combined phenomenological case study approach, the author examines hiring through a conceptual framework that brings together organizational culture and Borderlands theory to understand how committee decisions on hiring are informed by their campus’s HSI designation and cultural identity. Through analysis of faculty search chair interviews, faculty search chairs at a borderland HSI are committed to hiring with their student population in mind by enacting a Latinx-serving consciousness. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to a broader conversation on servingness as well as scholarship on how educators and administrators can embrace the cultural values that their Latinx students possess to make decisions in hiring.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Harnessing a cluster randomized controlled trial, we estimated the impact on students’ advanced placement (AP) examination performance of a project-based learning (PBL) approach to AP compared with a lecture-based AP approach. Through PBL, teachers primarily play a facilitator role, while students work on complex tasks organized around central questions leading to a final product. We estimated positive and significant treatment effects on AP exam performance for the overall sample, within both AP courses studied, and within low- and high-income student groups. Results support teacher-driven adoption of the PBL AP approach within both courses studied, among districts with open-enrollment AP policies and supportive of PBL, for students from low- and high-income households.

                  <p>In mathematics education research, proofs are often conceptualized as sequences of mathematical assertions. We argue that this ignores proofs that contain instructions to perform mathematical actions, often in the form of imperatives, which are common both in mathematical practice and in undergraduate mathematics textbooks. We consider in detail a specific type of proof which we call a recipe proof, which is comprised of sequence of instructions that direct the reader to produce mathematical objects with desirable properties. We present a model of what it means to understand a recipe proof and use this model in conjunction with process-object theories from mathematics education research, to explain why recipe proofs are inherently difficult for students to understand.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Undergraduate calculus instruction is a contributor to racialized and gendered trends of STEM persistence and disidentification with mathematics. However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students’ perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices – instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) – were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants’ perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students’ experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked. We conclude with implications for practice and research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As attention grows towards the disparities and underrepresentation of minoritized groups within undergraduate STEM education, there is a need for understanding how university calculus program stakeholders perceive the issue of increasing diversity. Calculus is a subject crucial to many STEM disciplines, and thus can play an outsized role in facilitating necessary change across STEM fields. We present a research-driven framework from a thematic analysis of interviews and focus groups with calculus program stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, and administrators) at two universities in the United States. The framework juxtaposes various stakeholders’ motivations for diversifying STEM fields along critical and dominant axes with four primary recipients that benefit from diversifying STEM. This framework prompts critical analysis of increasing access and achievement within the current system while also attending to the need to fundamentally change mathematical structures to bolster individual identities and increase the power of marginalized individuals in STEM disciplines.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aims to address the teaching of integrals in multivariable calculus concerning the role taken by geometry, specifically, geometrical content dealing with boundaries in integrals that appear as curves and surfaces in R2 and R3. Adopting the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, we approached the problem by performing a praxeological analysis of typical tasks in a multivariable calculus course to describe the geometry involved, and to support the transition from textbook knowledge where geometry seems to be hidden. Our analysis reveals a collection of geometrical praxeologies that are used in the tasks but are not explicitly taught. Interviews with students show that we cannot consider that students are equipped with these praxeologies prior to taking the course on multivariable calculus.
