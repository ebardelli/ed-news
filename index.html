  Abstract
                    <p>Modelling competencies are currently included in numerous curricula worldwide and are generally accepted as a complex, process-oriented construct. Therefore, effective measurement should include multiple dimensions, like the sub-competencies required throughout the modelling process. Departing from the characteristics of modelling problems as open and often underdetermined real-world problems, we propose to enrich the current conceptualisation of mathematical modelling competencies by including creativity, which plays an important role in numerous phases of the mathematical modelling process but has scarcely been considered in modelling discourse. In the study described in this paper, a new instrument for the evaluation of this enriched construct has been developed and implemented. The modelling competencies incorporating creativity of the students were evaluated based on the adequacy of the models and the modelling processes proposed, and the appropriateness and completeness of the approaches were evaluated in detail. Adapting measurement approaches for creativity that have been developed in the problem-solving discourse, certain criteria of creativity were selected to evaluate the creativity of the students’ approaches in tackling modelling problems—namely, usefulness, fluency, and originality. The empirical study was conducted among 107 Chinese students at the upper secondary school level, who attended a modelling camp and independently solved three complex modelling problems. The results reveal significant correlations between fluency and originality in students’ performances across all tasks; however, the relationships between usefulness and the other two creativity aspects were not consistent. Overall, the results of the study support the importance of the inclusion of creativity in the construct of modelling competencies.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examined how expert and novice (preservice) teachers solved mathematical modelling tasks as well as how they noticed written artifacts of student thinking that were in response to the mathematical modelling tasks. Some teachers in both groups were aware of the openness and underdetermination of the modelling tasks and that these characteristics implied that underlying assumptions needed to be made in order to solve the tasks. Indeed, nearly all of the expert teachers addressed the need to make assumptions for the Seashell Task. When examining student work, both expert and preservice teachers interpreted positive aspects in the students’ solutions and provided feedback to students. However, almost all of the expert teachers responded by asking questions, whereas around a third of preservice teachers directly corrected students’ mistakes and another third pointed out mistakes without correcting them. This study provides a new angle to study teachers’ mathematical competencies, the assessment of modelling competencies, and considerations for the development of teachers’ modelling competencies.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Although mathematical modeling plays an important role in many curricula worldwide, significant discrepancies persist in the importance of mathematical modeling in ordinary mathematics classrooms and teacher education. This paper compares pre-service mathematics teachers’ professional mathematical modeling competencies in three different regions—Germany, Mainland China, and Hong Kong—where educational and cultural traditions differ, including the role of mathematical modeling. In total, 232 pre-service mathematics teachers from the three regions completed a modeling task covering mathematics content knowledge (MCK) of modeling and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) of modeling. The results show that pre-service teachers from Germany demonstrated the strongest MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling; by contrast, pre-service mathematics teachers from Mainland China and Hong Kong demonstrated relatively weaker MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling. MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling were also found to be unevenly developed at different competence levels for the three regions. These differences may be attributed to the history of mathematical modeling in mathematics curricula, teacher education, and teaching culture in these three regions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The article deals with the pedagogical content knowledge of mathematical modelling as part of the professional competence of pre-service teachers. With the help of a test developed for this purpose from a conceptual model, we examine whether this pedagogical content knowledge can be promoted in its different facets—especially knowledge about modelling tasks and about interventions—by suitable university seminars. For this purpose, the test was administered to three groups in a seminar for the teaching of mathematical modelling: (1) to those respondents who created their own modelling tasks for use with students, (2) to those trained to intervene in mathematical modelling processes, and (3) participating students who are not required to address mathematical modelling. The findings of the study—based on variance analysis—indicate that certain facets (knowledge of modelling tasks, modelling processes, and interventions) have increased significantly in both experimental groups but to varying degrees. By contrast, pre-service teachers in the control group demonstrated no significant change to their level of pedagogical content knowledge.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper reports on empirical results about the influence of two different teaching designs on the development of tertiary students’ modelling competency and attitudes towards modelling. A total of 144 first year engineering students were exposed to a diagnostic entrance test, a modelling unit consisting of five lessons with ten tasks, enframed by a pre- and a post-test, and at the end a questionnaire on attitudes towards mathematical modelling. Similar to the German DISUM study, in the modelling unit, one group of participants followed an independence-oriented teaching style, aiming at a balance between students’ independent work and teacher’s guidance, while two other groups were taught according to a more traditional teacher-guided style. Linear mixed regression models were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The results show that all groups had significant learning progress, although there is much room for further improvement, and that the group taught according to the independence-oriented design had the biggest competency growth. In addition, this group exhibited more positive attitudes than the other groups in five of six attitudinal aspects.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Though there is an extensive research literature on understanding and assessing individual modeling competencies, less attention has been given to characterizing the social context of the classroom in which modeling occurs. Yet a classroom’s culture of modeling—its negotiated system of beliefs and values about the nature of modeling and what constitutes a complete, satisfactory solution to a modeling problem—has a shaping influence on its members’ participation in modeling activities. Devising a means of assessing classroom modeling cultures is thus a crucial task for both research and praxis. In this article, we present an approach to operationally defining and assessing classroom modeling cultures, which is (a) based in quantitative analyses of discourse during whole-class presentations of modeling solutions, and (b) grounded in research in individual modeling competencies. We show how our assessment distinguishes the classroom modeling cultures of different classrooms and how it captures shifts over time in the modeling culture of a given classroom. Finally, we accompany our quantitative results with interpretive analyses of presentation discourse, to triangulate and to attribute meaning to the patterns our assessment detects. Our primary data sources include video recorded presentation and Q&amp;A sessions for three modeling activities in each of two US middle school (Grades 5–8) classrooms. Our assessment approach is a significant contribution because it operationalizes the construct of a classroom’s modeling culture, in terms that highlight potential connections with the research literature of individual modeling competencies. It therefore invites modeling research that coordinates learning and development across individual and social levels.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>To solve mathematical modelling problems, students must translate real-world situations, which are typically presented in text form, into mathematical models. To complete the translation process, the problem-solver must first understand the real-world situation. Therefore, reading comprehension can be considered an essential part of solving modelling problems, and fostering reading comprehension might lead to better modelling competence. Further, ease of comprehension and involvement have been found to increase interest in the learning material, and thus, improving reading comprehension might also increase interest in modelling. The aims of this study were to (a) determine whether providing students with reading comprehension prompts would improve the modelling sub-competencies needed to construct a model of the real-world situation and their interest in modelling and (b) analyze the hypothesized effects in two different educational environments (Germany and Taiwan). We conducted an experimental study of 495 ninth graders (201 German and 294 Taiwanese students). The results unexpectedly revealed that providing reading comprehension prompts did not affect the construction of a real-world model. Further, providing reading comprehension prompts improved students’ situational interest. The effects of providing reading comprehension prompts on the construction of a real-world model were similar in Germany and Taiwan. Students’ interest in modelling improved more in Germany. An in-depth quantitative analysis of students’ responses to reading prompts, their solutions, and their interest in the experimental group confirmed the positive relation between reading comprehension and modelling and indicated that the reading comprehension prompts were not sufficient for improving reading comprehension. Implications for future research are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this article, we describe the generation of a Design and Implementation Framework for Mathematical Modelling Tasks (DIFMT) through a researcher-teacher collaboration. The purpose of the framework is to support holistic approaches to instructional modelling competency. This framework is underpinned by principles drawn from theory and praxis which are informed by the anticipatory capabilities that teachers require for the design and effective implementation of quality modelling tasks in secondary classrooms. A draft DIFMT was developed from a synthesis of research literature and was refined through an iterative process of task development, implementation and observation, reflection through teacher/student interviews, and revision of the framework. Each iteration made use of the most recent refinement of the co-constructed DIFMT, building theory while simultaneously addressing a problem in educational practice, consistent with a design-based methodology. Thus, the DIMFT developed organically throughout the project. While initial modelling exemplars were researcher-designed, the locus of responsibility moved to teachers as the project progressed. The DIFMT consists of two major components—principles for modelling task design and pedagogical architecture—each of which is structured around dimensions that include elaborations which detail the knowledge required for modelling as well as teacher and student capabilities.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This qualitative study examined how prospective mathematics teachers attend to, interpret, and respond to student misconceptions through providing them a video-case-based professional development environment. A sample of 30 prospective teachers attending an elective course was asked to watch video cases about student misconceptions related to the concept of measurement. Then, class discussions were held on the misconceptions, reasons, and suggestions to remedy the misconceptions. Thereafter they individually wrote down their response to an open-ended question asking them how to remedy the misconceptions. Data obtained from the discussions and individual reports were analyzed using the content analysis technique with the framework of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking. Findings indicated that the professional development environment provided prospective teachers with an opportunity to attend to, interpret, and then decide how to respond to student misconceptions. We found that while prospective teachers generally understand how students think and why misconceptions arise, they mostly provided partial evidence for interpreting. Moreover, their suggestions for addressing mathematical misconceptions were generally based on conceptual understanding. Our findings suggested that in order to acquire skills in noticing student thinking, it is important that prospective teachers have sufficient opportunity to reflect on likely misconceptions in a professional context.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The current study is part of a comprehensive research on linking visualization, students’ construction of geometrical concepts and their definitions, and students’ ability to prove. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of learners’ understanding of definitions of geometrical concepts on their understanding of the essence of geometrical proofs and their ways of proving. By “understanding” (geometrical definitions and/or proofs), we mean knowing the definition’s and/or proof’s meaning and their role within the logic structure of geometry and also the ability to define and/or prove in “geometrically correct” ways. Ninety grade 11 students from an Arab high school in Israel participated in the comprehensive study in geometry of which the current study forms a part. Research tasks for the investigation of the current study’s aim were designed, constructed, and used in a questionnaire to the whole research population and in interviews with about 10% of the population. The findings point clearly to effects of elements within the students’ understanding of definitions on their understanding of proofs and on their ability to prove. These elements are as follows: (a) The difficulty to internalize that an incomplete definition is an incorrect definition and may lead to an incomplete proof. (b) The difficulty to deal with non-economical definitions forms the basis to non-economical proofs. (c) Students have difficulties to accept equivalent definitions to the same geometrical concept. (d) The students’ lack of understanding the origin of a constructive definition of geometrical concept.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Relationships between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity have been widely studied, but few studies are available for primary school age. For an investigation in this age group, it seems appropriate to use a content area that not only has high relevance for mathematics and special potentials for creativity, but also requires only a little knowledge and is easily accessible. We therefore investigated whether mathematically gifted primary school students differ from non-gifted ones in high creativity in dealing with mathematical patterns and structures. This question was explored in an interview study in which 24 third graders were asked to invent as many different figural patterns as possible, which enabled creative mathematical activity also by combining arithmetic and geometric aspects. A detailed qualitative analysis of the data revealed among other results several types of flexibility concerning the invention of patterns. The selection of students ensured that all participants performed well to very well in regular mathematics classes and that 14 of them could additionally be assumed to be mathematically gifted based on a specific test. This allowed a comparison of both subgroups. Results indicate a high correspondence between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity concerning the invention of figural patterns.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Emotions play an essential role in pre-service teachers’ competence development, particularly in mathematics. However, the emotion of shame in mathematics has been largely neglected so far. This article deals with shameful experiences of pre-service primary school teachers during their mathematical education at school and the various effects of shame on their decision to study mathematics as a subject at university. The research consists of a qualitative and a quantitative study with 311 prospective primary school teachers who responded to a survey about their experiences of shame in mathematics at school when they were students. Results of the qualitative study emphasize the different experiences in mathematics during the school years and reveal the characteristics of these situations, for example, social exposure or competition games. In the quantitative study, pre-service primary teachers’ subject choice was analyzed in relation to their experienced shame in mathematics at school. Results reveal that shame experienced at school has effects on the initial choice in favor of mathematics at university. Implications for primary teacher education are finally discussed.</p>
