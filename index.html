  Abstract
                  <p>Prior studies have identified the impact beliefs have on mathematics instructors’ instructional practice, such as their choice to (or not to) lecture. However, the role of instructional context role in influencing beliefs and instruction has not been thoroughly researched. This paper explores how course context and beliefs could impact mathematics instructors’ propensity to lecture by investigating two very different instructional contexts in undergraduate mathematics in the United States: Calculus and Abstract Algebra. The results of our regression analyses were significant in both data sets and, we did find beliefs in each context that predicted the amount of time spent lecturing. For instance, the more calculus instructors believed in the effectiveness of teacher-centered instructional practices, the more likely they were to lecture. Whereas the more abstract algebra instructors believed in their student’s capacity to learn the less likely they were to lecture. However, while the regression model for the abstract algebra instructors accounted for 37.8% of the variability in the reported amount of time spent lecturing, the model for Calculus instructors only accounted for 2.7% of the variability. Thus our analyses indicate that there are contextual differences, such as course coordination, student demographics, and the job security of the instructors, that may be mitigating the extent to which beliefs impact instructional practice.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Volume 58, Issue 6, Page 1107-1141, December 2021. <br>This critical race ethnography examines a secondary-level dual-language (DL) program, a bilingual-education model thought to provide Latinxs educational equity. Drawing from a three-stage recursive analytic approach, I present evidence that a DL program’s policies and practices valued offering Latinx youth biliterate schooling only so long as DL was available and advantageous to Whites—which ultimately excluded some Latinx students from bilingual education and/or accessing its benefits. I theorize DL functions as white property when DL perpetuates racial hierarchies and preserves the value of a white racial identity, thereby maintaining Whites’ inequitable material accumulation. I problematize the logic of DL—highlighting that DL has the elitist tendencies of world-language education—and assess DL’s potential to deliver educational justice to Latinxs.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>To investigate how prompts shape preservice teachers’ reflections, we examined, in this exploratory case study, the written reflections responding to three types of prompts (standard-based, concept-based, and task-based) of 21 preservice teachers in an online technology integration class. We analyzed these reflections at the sentence level (total 1,503 comments), both quantitatively and qualitatively, using a framework comprising descriptive, rationalistic, and anticipatory dimensions to understand the compositions of reflections generated from each type of prompt and the kinds of teacher abilities demonstrated in each dimension. We found quantitative patterns between prompt types and the reflections generated and emergent themes in each dimension of reflection relating to teacher abilities. We conclude by discussing three prompt design features that appeared to have played an important role in shaping the reflections and suggesting implications and future research directions.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Participating in discussions of classroom video can support teachers to attend to student thinking. Central to the success of these discussions is how teachers interpret the activity they are engaged in—how teachers frame what they are doing. In asynchronous online environments, negotiating framing poses challenges, given that interactions are not in real time and often require written text. We present findings from an online course designed to support teachers to frame video discussions as making sense of student thinking. In an engineering pedagogy course designed to emphasize responsiveness to students’ thinking, we documented shifts in teachers’ framing, with teachers more frequently making sense of, rather than evaluating, student thinking later in the course. These findings show that it is possible to design an asynchronous online course to productively engage teachers in video discussions and inform theory development in online teacher education.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent innovations in professional development are rife with a wide array of efforts focused on teacher collaboration. In this essay, we address some of the unexamined assumptions about the nature and significance of interactions in teacher professional collaboration, drawing on the concept of the “fourth wall” from theater and film studies. The fourth wall is a term used to describe the invisible wall that separates actors from their audience. We use this metaphor to interrogate the function of the fourth wall in professional learning and argue that it reflects a culture of professional learning that, despite innovations that tout teacher collaboration, upholds isolation in teaching and teacher learning and deep embedded norms of noninterference in one another’s practice. We also attend to the possibilities for supporting teacher learning that breaching the fourth wall affords when shared enactments of practice are used as a context for teachers’ sensemaking and collaboration.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study, hypothetical samples of students’ work on a task involving pattern generalizations were used to examine the characteristics of the ways in which 154 elementary prospective teachers (PSTs) paid attention to students’ work in mathematics. The analysis included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their suggestions for supporting students’ further learning. While the findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of mathematical learning, their analyses of students’ thinking and their ideas for supporting students’ learning lacked sophistication. Also, there was considerable divergence between the students’ thinking as evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs’ suggested support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The literature on proof by contradiction (PBC) is nearly unanimous in claiming that this proof technique is “more difficult” for students than direct proof, and offers multiple hypotheses as to why this might be the case. To examine this claim and to evaluate some of the hypotheses, we analyzed student work on proof construction problems from homework and examinations in a university “Introduction to Proof” course taught by one of the authors. We also conducted stimulated-recall interviews with student volunteers probing their thought processes while solving these problems, and their views about PBC in general. Our results suggest that the knowledge resources students bring to bear on proof problems, and how these resources are activated, explain more of their “difficulties” than does the logical structure of the proof technique, at least for this population of students.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics teaching in a 21st-century educational context requires a shift to active learning. The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers’ self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers’ self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers’ report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher’s professional development.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The article introduces a mathematics education measure in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China and explores students’ degree of approval and perception of digital equity towards the response. After the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Chinese New Century Primary School Mathematics Textbook (NCPM) committee had developed a series of micro classes (abbreviated as NCPM micro classes), and more than 25 million teachers and students in China watched the NCPM micro classes during the 3 months social isolation. Then, students’ degree of approval towards the NCPM micro classes and perception of digital equity were examined after social isolation. A total of 132,740 pieces of data were collected from Chinese primary school students. Quantitative analysis of student’s degree of approval towards different parts of NCPM micro classes indicated that the introduction, interaction, summary and consolidation, curriculum characteristics, and goal achievement parts of the NCPM micro classes have received high approval from students, and students with higher former achievement perceived a higher degree of approval towards the NCPM micro classes. Furthermore, we found that gender, socioeconomic status, school location, and learning location had no significant impact on students’ degree of approval, indicating a digital equity exists. This study helps researchers or educators understand the mathematics education response to the COVID-19 outbreak in China and extends our understanding of primary students’ degree of approval and perception of digital equity with these online classes.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The theoretical reflection on the nature of school algebra and the development of algebraic thinking from the first educational levels is a relevant topic in mathematics education. In this paper, we first summarize and clarify the positions held on this topic by two theoretical frameworks: the Theory of Objectification and the Onto-semiotic Approach. We identify concordances and complementarities in the respective conceptions of algebra and of the processes of developing algebraic thinking, as a result of applying these frameworks to analyse some students’ responses to a task on numerical patterns. We also analyse and compare the didactic models proposed in both theoretical frameworks for developing algebraic thinking. The analysis of the algebraic thinking and learning episodes is also used to illustrate a general discussion on the identity and boundaries of these theoretical frameworks and the possibilities of coordination and integration.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Our research involves interacting with students and teachers through Teaching Experiments conducted in mathematics classes. The core scientific objectives of our work are to study the mathematical strategies used by students and the meaning they associate with the concepts at stake. Our interest in students’ comprehension of and approaches to their mathematics work requires that we continuously take into account the mathematics they produce in class so we can understand their methods and discover their underlying meanings. During a recent project carried out over the course of a school year, teachers from the primary and secondary classes that participated in the study spontaneously and repeatedly commented on the positive impact of our work on class dynamics: it created an environment that stimulated students’ mathematical work and fostered their sustained engagement. Although this was initially outside the scientific scope of our study, the significance and frequency of these comments from teachers caught our attention. This article describes the impact, or collateral outcomes, that our Teaching Experiments had on students and the classroom environment. Following a description of the scientific parameters guiding our research, we identify the scientific and epistemological foundations grounding our work. We then provide a detailed analysis of the collateral outcomes of our approach as expressed in the teachers’ statements. From this analysis emerges the theoretical concept of kindness, which offers a conceptualization of how our Teaching Experiments impact students, the classroom environment and the mathematics performed therein. Studying outcomes through the lens of kindness leads us to propose the notion of didactic kindness, as one that focuses on students’ progress in their mathematic abilities in class.</p>

We conducted a study among primary and secondary teachers in Quebec (n = 626) where we asked them to describe the practices they use for teaching probability. We performed both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis on the results. The independent variables in the study were the level of education and the subject area of probability. The dependent variables were the participants’ self-reported levels of mathematical proficiency, instructional confidence, use of probabilistic approaches, and use of manipulatives in probability teaching. The results show variations according to the subject area of probability and the level of education being taught.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past decade, initiatives around the world have introduced computing into K–12 education under the umbrella of computational thinking. While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K–12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K–12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.

  Abstract
                  <p>Models-and-modeling perspective (MMP) is a problem-solving and learning perspective in mathematics education. Although modeling processes have been addressed widely in the international discussion on mathematical modeling, a homogeneous understanding has not been established yet. Hence, the field needs studies addressing the epistemological grounds of model development. Therefore, in this study, I aimed to scrutinize the latent aspects of modeling in MMP-based research. Based on the analysis of 143 chapter-sized documents, I aimed to articulate the characteristics of the modeling process and the models. The thematic analysis that was incorporated in document analysis revealed four latent aspects, namely, modeling (1) is a subjective and also inter- and intra-subjective process, (2) encompasses both structural and systematic properties, (3) produces models that are both implicit and explicit to a certain degree, and (4) culminates in an incomplete — but not inadequate — model. These aspects of model development led me to reconceptualize what a model conveys in MMP-based research and articulate the potential and limits of the models. This is particularly important for teachers and researchers in understanding what models indicate in relation to students’ ways of thinking, and such a systematic and analytical investigation can contribute to the scholarly conversation about modeling in the field of mathematics education.</p>

Many hypotheses have been offered to support or explain this belief, yet they span a disorientingly wide swath of journal articles, conference papers, dissertations, book chapters, etc. In addition, few attempts have been made to organize these hypotheses or carefully test them. In this paper, we conduct a thorough literature review on PBC, organize existing hypotheses about challenges with PBC into a Hypothesis Framework for (Students’ Difficulty with) Proof By Contradiction (HFPBC), discuss the state of research related to each hypothesis, and offer thoughts on the future study of these hypotheses.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Proficiency in oral communication is an important skill to develop in science. Central to its development is self-efficacy. In this study we examine two aspects of self-efficacy: first, standards and content, and second, showmanship. We looked at these aspects among students enrolled in a natural sciences program at the Quebec collège level (a two-year post-secondary program in which students are usually between the ages of 17 and 19) in relation to their experiences of oral communication on scientific subjects. A sample of students responded to a questionnaire developed as part of this study on perceptions and attitudes towards communicating orally in the sciences (PACOS), first at the start of their program (n = 1292) and then at the end (n = 179). A subsample of this group (n = 26) also participated in an interview for deeper analysis. The results, coupled with those from a previous study, show that the two aforementioned aspects of self-efficacy are distinct but complementary. Moreover, we observed that they are linked to other subcomponents of one’s attitude towards scientific oral communication—namely anxiety, pleasure, perception of relevance, and context. Finally, we noted that the standards and content aspect of self-efficacy remained consistent over time, while the sense of showmanship increased among participants between the start and end of their studies.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>With the recent escalation in interior immigration enforcement across the United States, immigrant and U.S.-born children are increasingly exposed to coercive measures that have been shown to disrupt their development. This study examines the relationship between immigration-related arrests and the educational outcomes of Hispanics—a group that is overwhelmingly targeted by immigration authorities. Using data on the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, we estimate the impact of immigration enforcement on Hispanics’ school enrollment. We find that increases in the arrest rate are accompanied by substantial declines in enrollment among Hispanic youth, including U.S.-born, foreign-born, and individuals in mixed-status families. Additionally, we do not find evidence of this relationship among other racial/ethnic groups, suggesting that the impact is concentrated among Hispanic individuals. Our results advance our understanding of the unintended consequences of immigration enforcement on educational outcomes and show that ethnicity is a crucial factor in this process.
