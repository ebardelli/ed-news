          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to investors in the crude oil market. Furthermore, investors have an increasing need to find a safe haven in their investment portfolios when facing unprecedented risks in crude oil markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a review of the literature, there are contradictory findings on which investment is the safer haven for the oil market. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate whether bitcoin is a safer haven for the crude oil market than the commonly used gold during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three spillover measurements based on the time, and frequency domains, and a network framework are employed to quantify the return spillover effects among bitcoin, gold and three major crude oil futures markets. We divide the sample into two periods, pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19. The results show that bitcoin has a weak safe-haven effect on the crude oil market only over a short period, while gold maintains a good safe-haven ability for crude oil futures across various time horizons (frequencies), both before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study have important implications for policy-makers, crude oil producers and global investors. In particularly, investors cannot ignore the importance of bitcoin and gold in selecting more profitable portfolio policies when searching for safe-haven assets.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>University faculty have the talent, creativity, and training to tackle the serious challenges confronting our education system today, but the incentive structure in universities is often at odds with real-world contributions. What tensions are experienced by faculty who may be interested in partnership-oriented, engaged scholarship? How can these tensions be addressed? This chapter explores the tensions, particularly in the context of education research-practice partnerships, and provide examples from universities that are taking steps to lessen the tensions and encourage faculty participation in partnerships. By adopting new structures and incentives, these universities are providing a pathway to engaged scholarship that may ultimately increase the power of research to address the problems that educators face each day. However, university leaders who are implementing institutional change must grapple with long-established norms and traditions, and show how new ways of assessing the value of research will benefit universities as well as their communities.

          Abstract
                  <p>A persistent problem in teaching introductory statistics has been helping students overcome their fears and the abstract nature of what they need to learn. Students’ own contextualised stories are argued to present an opportunity for humanising the abstract, helping reduce student fears to complement traditional teaching approaches. This paper applies Bruner (Actual minds, possible worlds, Harvard University Press, 1986) theoretical perspectives on narrative mode of thought to understand how students’ own contextualised stories might support them in making sense of university introductory statistics. An exploratory, design research study was undertaken where 31 student participants were interviewed across a two-year period. All participants had completed an introductory statistics course where they wrote contextualised children’s stories about normal distributions and sampling distributions of the mean. Using an assumption-based, conjecture-driven, reflective analysis, participant interview data was analysed to generate preliminary research findings. Two preliminary findings are detailed in this paper. One revealed that participants initially don’t seem to naturally make connections with statistics using their own stories, while another showed that once they did so, their stories helped initiate pathways of access for making sense of their statistical learning. To test the preliminary findings, Bruner (Actual minds, possible worlds, Harvard University Press, 1986) theoretical perspectives on narrative mode of thought—presupposition, subjectification, and multiple perspectives—were used to develop an analytical tool. The methodology in the study provides new insights for understanding how students’ own contextualised stories might help them make sense of their learning. The implications of the study are relevant for statistics education, particularly in the areas of statistical thinking processes.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Community colleges are essential for United States higher education, but their students have low retention and graduation rates. Community college students assigned to mathematics remediation are particularly unlikely to graduate. Corequisite remediation (college-level coursework with additional support) has shown short-term increased student success. The current study examined the 7-year results of a randomized controlled trial of corequisite remediation with college-level statistics. Students assigned to the corequisite group were 50 percent more likely to complete associate’s degrees within 3 years, and 100 percent more likely to complete bachelor’s degrees within 5 years. Corequisite students also earned, on average, $3,000–$4,500 more in years 5 to 7. Mediation analysis further suggests that the wage treatment effect was due to shortened time to degree.

          Abstract
      
                  <p>This work reports the results of an investigation that aimed to know the informal reasoning of high school students with and about the frequency approach of probability and the law of large numbers when they were faced with a problem about random intervals. The research question was as follows: What features of students’ reasoning about the frequency approach of probability are revealed when they solve a task on random intervals? To advance the answer, an activity was carried out involving students between ages 16 and 17 who built random intervals through manipulative and computational simulations, the latter with the software Fathom. In addition, they were provided with a worksheet with questions for them to express their reasoning. Their responses were coded and ranked. At the end, we summarize the results and highlight prediction and variability as essential features to understand the frequency approach to probability.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The multiple-choice (MC) item format has been widely used in educational assessments across diverse content domains. MC items purportedly allow for collecting richer diagnostic information. The effectiveness and economy of administering MC items may have further contributed to their popularity not just in educational assessment. The MC item format has also been adapted to the cognitive diagnosis (CD) framework. Early approaches simply dichotomized the responses and analyzed them with a CD model for binary responses. Obviously, this strategy cannot exploit the additional diagnostic information provided by MC items. De la Torre’s MC Deterministic Inputs, Noisy “And” Gate (MC-DINA) model was the first for the explicit analysis of items having MC response format. However, as a drawback, the attribute vectors of the distractors are restricted to be nested within the key and each other. The method presented in this article for the CD of DINA items having MC response format does not require such constraints. Another contribution of the proposed method concerns its implementation using a nonparametric classification algorithm, which predestines it for use especially in small-sample settings like classrooms, where CD is most needed for monitoring instruction and student learning. In contrast, default parametric CD estimation routines that rely on EM- or MCMC-based algorithms cannot guarantee stable and reliable estimates—despite their effectiveness and efficiency when samples are large—due to computational feasibility issues caused by insufficient sample sizes. Results of simulation studies and a real-world application are also reported.

Frasier left K-12 teaching to return to high education, she received an email stating that her students’ end-of-year assessments were in. When she looked at the scores, she was pleased to see they had done so well, even though she questions the value of standardized accountability measures and didn’t learn anything new from the results. Frasier discusses why these scores are not helpful and advocates more meaningful measures.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 4, Page 23-27, December 2022/January 2023. <br> T. Philip Nichols and Alexander Monea explore the spread of data-driven surveillance (i.e., dataveillance) technologies in schools, which are increasingly used as a strategy for mitigating safety risks. They argue that the sense of security schools derive from these technologies often comes at the cost of students’ actual well-being and privacy. Drawing on research with teachers and administrators, they highlight several ethical challenges dataveillance technologies raise as they are incorporated into classrooms. They conclude with suggestions for how educators might de-escalate their dependence on dataveillance without compromising students’ safety.

Restorative practice (RP) is a powerful approach for achieving these goals as it elevates student voice and can strengthen school climate. Annie M. White and John Kenneth Weiss share findings from an initiative through which high school student-faculty teams learned strategies to use RP practices and incorporate student voice to improve school climate. After two years, students gained the confidence to work for school change. They offer implementation recommendations, including prioritizing relationship-building, reaching a critical mass, and providing structure for engagement. Ultimately, they found that student voice and engagement may be key to improving school climate.

Charles Bell interviewed Black students from urban and suburban schools across Michigan and learned that they did not feel safe at school. The absence of reliable safety measures at school leads students to rely on a “code” that provides protection in school by encouraging students to fight to demonstrate their toughness, win respect, and form alliances to ensure group safety. Among other things, the code of the school transforms suspension into a status symbol that undermines school authority, potentially increases school violence, and leads to the criminalization of Black students.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 4, Page 42-47, December 2022/January 2023. <br> There is a cultural mismatch between teachers and students in classrooms across the U.S. that, despite teachers’ best intentions, too often leads to student harm. Mentors are uniquely positioned to interrupt conscious and unconscious bias that leads to inequitable practices but often have difficulty holding the necessary hard conversations. Among the reasons for this is socialized niceness, particularly in women, which prioritizes comfort and avoids conflict at all costs. Nina F. Weisling and Wendy Gardiner provide insights for recognizing, naming, and working through socialized niceness in mentoring to ensure all students have opportunities to learn in safe and rigorous classrooms.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 4, Page 34-40, December 2022/January 2023. <br> Public schooling in the 19th century cultivated in students a shared sense of identity as citizens with a common culture. However, posits David Labaree, U.S. schools are less effective than they used to be at serving this purpose, making their value to the nation-state open to questioning. Labaree considers three common functions that public schools serve for the state — legitimacy, economic productivity, and civic community — and questions how well schools serve, or even undermine, these purposes. Schools rely on the state for support, but that support is in danger if systems of schooling promote division and are not perceived as promoting a common good.
