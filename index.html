  Abstract
                  <p>Most research has focused solely on understanding high school or college students’ mathematical creative thinking abilities while understanding younger students’ creative thinking in mathematics was ignored. These studies of older students have focused mainly on students’ creative products rather than creative processes. The authors of the present study investigated four young elementary school students’ creative processes through eye-tracking (ET) and stimulated recall interview (SRI) techniques while they engaged in multiple representations (MRs) of mathematical problems. Our qualitative case study revealed what phases four elementary school students’ creative processes in MRs involve and how they achieve original ideas. The results revealed that neither Wallas’ (1926) creative process of mathematicians nor  Schindler and Lilienthal’s (2020) creative process of a high school student could fully explain the creative processes of four young elementary school students in the present study. The findings from the present study emphasize that four young students’ creative processes are difficult to predict as it is non-linear compared to professional mathematicians’ creative process, but young students’ creative processes can be demystified through ET and SRI techniques. The present study also emphasizes the importance of external factors (e.g., teachers, peers, environment) for the four elementary school students to get different perspectives to achieve creative ideas in mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this commentary, we explore tensions between engaging students in authentic disciplinary mathematical activity and insights from critical theorists who analyze equity in mathematics education. The tensions arise as engaging students in authentic mathematical activity usually involve having students adopt the language and norms of another community. We suggest these tensions can be mitigated (but not eliminated) by (i) focusing on expanding students’ authentic mathematical practices while giving less concern towards eliminating inauthentic mathematical practices, (ii) not restricting authentic mathematical activity to the creation of new mathematics, and (iii) including activities that allow students to make mathematics personal.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>One typical challenge in algebra education is that many students justify the equivalence of expressions only by referring to transformation rules that they perceive as arbitrary without being able to justify these rules. A good algebraic understanding involves connecting the transformation rules to other characterizations of equivalence of expressions (e.g., description equivalence that both expressions describe the same situation or figure). In order to overcome this disconnection even before variables are introduced, a design research study was conducted in Grade 5 to design and investigate an early algebra learning environment to establish stronger connections between different mental models and representations of equivalence of expressions. The qualitative analysis of design experiments with 14 fifth graders revealed deep insights into complexities of connecting representations. It confirmed that many students first relate the representations in ways that are too superficial without establishing deep connections. Analyzing successful students’ processes helped to identify an additional characterization that can support students in bridging the connection between other characterizations, which we call restructuring equivalence. By including learning opportunities for restructuring equivalence, students can be supported to compare expressions in graphical and symbolic representation simultaneously and dynamically. The design research study disentangles the complex requirements for realizing the design principle of connecting multiple representations, which should be of relevance beyond the specific concept of equivalence and applicable to other mathematical topics.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Inquiry-Based learning (IBL) is a fairly well-known term in the United States (US) describing a range of student-centered or active pedagogical approaches in mathematics. However, the ‘big tent’ definitions of IBL mean that there is much variation in IBL users’ instructional practices, variation which we set out to codify. Cluster analysis of self-reported data from a survey of postsecondary calculus instructors across the US reveals three instructional profiles among self-declared users of IBL: (a) heavy users of group work; (b) users of a variety of mixed approaches; and (c) heavy users of didactic lecture. The instructional profile of this third group is indistinguishable from that of calculus instructors who report never having heard of IBL. We further investigate the relationship of these instructional profiles to certain beliefs about teaching and learning. All groups agree that inquiry supports learning; the groups who spend a minority of time in didactic lecture disagree with statements that there are benefits to lecturing. Implications for research and adoption of IBL are discussed.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: The Indonesian government has evaluated the research performance of universities, whose measurement process is projected into resources, management, outputs, and revenues to determine the provision of incentives, grants, and program funding to universities. However, efficiency calculations have shown that the outputs and competition-based incentives that drive scientific productivity are more complex. The most competitive systems must also be the most productive when considering resources. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the research efficiency in the Indonesian higher education system. Research Designs: The efficiency was analyzed by maximizing the 13 product outputs from the research budget and university staff. The result was then compared with the existing performance measurement analysis. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to evaluate the efficiency based on the data of 47 universities in the Mandiri cluster and 144 in the Utama cluster for the 2014–2018 period. Results: These findings showed that about 68% of universities have an efficiency value of 1 for the Mandiri group, almost 40% in the Utama group, and 41% for the two groups combined. Additionally, this study compared the efficiency analysis and the impact of the performance evaluation. Conclusions: The comparison showed that adding efficiency or productivity factors in the performance evaluation assessment produced a more accurate result.

  Abstract
                  <p>Given the significance of functional thinking as one of the main routes to foster early algebraic thinking, in this paper we describe how a current elementary mathematics textbook’s unit titled “Pattern and Correspondence” was developed in the Korean context. The following four key instructional elements for fostering functional thinking were extracted from the literature review: (a) correspondence relationships in real-life contexts; (b) various pattern tasks; (c) exploration for a correspondence relationship; and (d) symbol variables to represent a correspondence relationship. These elements were employed to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the unit covering pattern and correspondence in the previous mathematics textbook. Based on this analysis, a new draft for the pattern and correspondence unit was designed and implemented in an elementary school to test its appropriateness and ability to enhance students’ functional thinking. Students’ responses using the new draft were analyzed in terms of the four elements. Performance between the students with the new draft and their counterparts with the previous textbook was compared. The students with the new draft were more successful than their counterparts in exploring and representing the relationship between two quantities. The final version of the unit was developed and has been applied to all schools. The whole process of developing the unit can be an example of how to foster functional thinking through changes to curricular resources.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The nature of the area of mathematical competitions as a design science is considered, historical roots of mathematical problem-solving competitions are traced, the complementary aspects of mathematics as theory building and as problem solving are touched upon in relation to the practice of competitions. Two historical figures, Euler and Erdős, emerge, and the appropriateness of many of Euler’s mathematical ventures are seen as role models for competition mathematics as first put into practice in mathematical competitions towards the end of the nineteenth century. Distinctions and definitions are made, a venture into identifying competition syllabi and the principal types of reasoning employed in solving competition problems is explored, and a description of the many different types of competitions is considered. Interaction between the field of mathematics itself and problem-solving competitions is briefly explored, as are the possibilities that open when competitions and their access to huge amounts of data, both national and international, are taken into account in research belonging to mathematics education. Finally, the range of topics addressed in this special issue of ZDM is covered, along with some possible conclusions relating to the components of the overview.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Within the commognitive perspective, ritual and explorative routines are used in a very particular way to distinguish students’ routines according to whether they are driven by social reward or by generating a substantiated narrative. Explorative routines in this theorisation may refer not to inquiry-based activity but to the result of a student’s routine moving from being process-oriented to becoming outcome-oriented, a deritualisation. Choice of tasks as well as a teacher’s moves offer students different opportunities to engage in rituals, explorative routines and deritualisations. Through nuancing the space spanned by opportunities to engage in rituals and explorative routines respectively, we describe and contrast classroom practices in three lessons from three contexts. The lessons share a commonality in encouraging explorative routines as a starting point, yet being adapted towards ritual activity through decreased openings for student agentivity, fewer invitations for students’ own substantiations or both. We argue that such adaptations are driven by the teachers’ commitment to reach mathematical closure in a lesson, to balance considerations of the classroom community and individual students and to meet curricular requirements. Our model helps interrogate the nature and relevance of hybrids of explorative routines and rituals.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Mathematical objects are the outcomes of human discourse and come to life through the process of objectification. Primary and concrete discursive objects (d-objects) play an important role in this process, forming different realizations through the objectification process. In the present study, we analyze the written discourses about the derivative at a point in fourteen Year 11 and Year 12 Iranian calculus textbooks over 42 years (1979–2020) in terms of primary objects, concrete d-objects, and the realizations used in them, here based on Sfard’s commognitive theory. The research method is a qualitative content analysis in which the analysis units were texts, examples, activities, and exercises in the textbooks. The results show that out of the 14 textbooks, only five included primary and concrete d-objects. The other textbooks only used abstract objects in their written discourse about the derivative. The pictures (visual mediators) that were used as primary objects gradually changed from schematic to real colored photos, and locally developed technologies and cultural elements were included in the new textbook editions. Additionally, the number of concrete d-objects increased in the new editions. In terms of the realizations, the number of roots also increased over time; however, none of the textbooks had all five main realizations (i.e., symbolic, graphical, verbal, numerical, and physical) for the derivative at a point. The realization tree developed as part of this study can be used as an analytical framework to analyze calculus textbooks in other contexts and can be used by teachers and lecturers to help students have explorative participation in discourse on the derivative.</p>

                    <p>The transition from arithmetic to algebra in middle school can be critical for students having persistent difficulties in mathematics. The leading perception in our project is that holistic relational thinking is an effective problem-solving tool in both arithmetic and algebra. We worked in collaboration with two teachers of special classes to implement elements of this approach with Secondary I students. We implemented several problem-solving-related activities with students. We collected data through individual interviews with students before and after the intervention. Our data shows the positive effects of the intervention in students changing their strategies as well as overall success in solving word problems requiring relational analysis.</p>

                    <p>Le passage de l’arithmétique à l’algèbre à l’école intermédiaire peut s’avérer déterminant pour les élèves qui éprouvent des difficultés persistantes en mathématiques. Le principe qui oriente notre projet suppose que la pensée relationnelle holistique est un outil de résolution de problème efficace à la fois en arithmétique et en algèbre. Nous avons travaillé en collaboration avec deux enseignants de classes d’éducation spécialisée de première année de l’enseignement secondaire afin de mettre en œuvre des éléments de l’approche relationnelle holistique. Durant cette intervention, nous avons présenté aux élèves plusieurs activités liées à la résolution de problèmes puis nous avons recueilli des données par le biais d’entrevues individuelles avant et après l’intervention. Nos résultats indiquent que l’intervention a eu, dans l’ensemble des effets positifs sur la façon dont les élèves composent avec les problèmes écrits. Nous avons relevé des changements dans les stratégies adoptées par les élèves ainsi que dans leur taux global de réussite pour résoudre les problèmes écrits qui requièrent de l’analyse relationnelle.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The objective of this work is to show an educational path for combinatorics and graph theory that has the aim, on one hand, of helping students understand some discrete mathematics properties, and on the other, of developing modelling skills through a robust understanding. In particular, for the path proposed to middle-school students, we used a connection between k-permutations and colourings of graphs: we indicated a way to solve problems related to counting all the possible arrangements of given objects in a k-tuple under given constraints. We solve this kind of problem by associating a graph with the constraints related to the k-tuple and by using graphs’ colourings, in which every colour is associated with one of the objects. The number of arrangements is given by finding the number of colourings through an algorithm called the Connection-Contraction Algorithm. The educational path is set within the Teaching for Robust Understanding framework and the goal, from the mathematical skills perspective, is to enhance modelling, passing from real situations (the fish problem in our experiment) to mathematical problems (the graph’s colouring in our experiment) and vice versa through the use of technology (the Connection-Contraction Algorithm with yEd editor, in our experiment), by using an extended modelling cycle. The meetings with students were videotaped and some results of the experimentation are given.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Our research aimed to investigate the potential learning benefits to young children of implementing digital interactive multimodal technologies that provide both visual and haptic experiences in elementary mathematics classrooms. We studied the ways in which fourth-grade students collaboratively create collective strategies for solving mathematical problems utilizing dynamic geometry software with multi-touch interfaces, a combination we call a multi-touch Dynamic Geometry Environment. We examine in-depth two case studies each illustrating how mathematical strategies, collaboration, and socially mediated metacognition emerge in the small groups of children while working on an activity using the Geometer’s Sketchpad® on the iPad to make sense of an intuitive idea of covariation. We found that children’s interactions with their peers, the interviewer, and the mDGE favored the emergence of varied collaborative behaviors and socially mediated metacognitive processes that fostered the co-construction and development of mathematical strategies over a short period of time.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Technological innovation and its paradigm, that is, the Fourth Industrial Revolution-4IR, have shown strong impact on income levels of adopters across the globe. To this end, this analysis examines the impact of bank funding and institutional quality on technological advancement. Objectives: This study adds additional variables such as high-technology exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) as control variable. Our study period spans from 2000 to 2018 on an annual frequency for E7 economies (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, India, Turkey, Russia, and China). Research Design: This study leverages on cross-sectional ARDL, Augmented Mean Group (AMG), and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group Estimates (CCEMG) estimation techniques to examine long-run relationship between the outlined variables. Subjects: Empirical findings show that institution quality, bank finance, income, high-technology exports, and foreign direct investments exert a positive effect on advancements in technology. Furthermore, the interaction between bank finance and institution quality on technological advancement is also positive and statistically significant. Based on the findings, it is concluded that large-scale funding is crucial for businesses to leverage revolutionary technology. Likewise, access to large capital sources if made easier encourages technology affordance as well as innovation and operational excellence. Thus, economies with established legal and financial systems stand to offer businesses such security, which encourages business innovation. Conclusions: Consequently, E7 economies ought to improve their financial and legal systems to boost financial security, creativity, and competitiveness of businesses.

  Abstract
                  <p>Despite the challenges that primary historical sources present for students and instructors alike, engaging students with such sources as part of their mathematical learning experiences is an increasingly common instructional practice. Yet research on teaching and learning with primary sources remains a niche activity. It is thus reasonable to ask whether the use of primary sources merits broader attention from the mathematics education community. This article explores this question through the lens of Sfard’s commognitive theory of learning, which views mathematics as a discourse and mathematical learning as the process of becoming a participant in that discourse. Importantly, commognitive tenets apply to interpretations of mathematical development at both the historical and individual levels. I use these tenets to analyze a particular type of student project that adopts a guided reading approach to primary sources. Specifically, I examine examples of such projects that have been developed and used in the US to teach core mathematical topics at the university level since 2003, using commognitive theory to characterize the potential learning opportunities they afford. As with all instructional materials, these opportunities can be missed in classroom implementation. Nevertheless, the discourses represented in different instructional materials render some learning opportunities easier to offer students, while constraining the possibility of others. I thus also briefly examine some of the differences between these primary source projects and the standard textbooks that they are intended to replace.</p>
