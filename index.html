  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined Oregon’s early intervention (EI) and early childhood special education (ECSE) pipelines as a function of children’s intersecting ethnicity and home language(s) with a focus on children from Latino/a backgrounds with communication disorders. We found differences in children’s referral source and age of referral, likelihood of evaluation and placement, and type of placement for conditions related to communication, including autism spectrum disorder and hearing impairment. Results showed differences in EI and ECSE; however, disproportionality appeared greatest among Spanish-speaking Latino/a children and non-Latino/a children who spoke languages other than English compared to non-Latino/a English-speaking counterparts. Our findings suggest that attending to children’s intersecting ethnicity and language backgrounds in referral, evaluation, and placement add nuance to examinations of disproportionality. Results also indicate that practices related to characterizing children’s communication disorders likely make substantial contributions to inequities in EI and ECSE. Precise identification of differences in service provision can lead to targeted policy and practice solutions to reduce structural barriers to care in EI/ECSE systems and improve equity, particularly as related to placement for children of color with communication concerns.

  Abstract
                  <p>Given that early career elementary teachers face pressure to plan pedagogy that provides equitable opportunities to learn mathematics for understanding, it is important to consider their mathematics lesson planning practices. This study uses interview data to compare the planning practices of four early career teachers (ECTs) who consistently rated highly on an observational measure of high-quality mathematics instruction with those of three ECTs who consistently rated lower. ECTs who scored highly addressed planning challenges in interconnected ways that were responsive to students’ needs, demonstrated more agency in representing mathematics content in their planning, and were more likely to maintain curricular rigor when differentiating. We consider implications for efforts to help ECTs plan lessons that are likely to result in high-quality instruction.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The renewable energy consumption plays a significant role in achieving sustainable development, but a sectoral approach is necessary to design the better recommendations for each sector. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the use of this type of energy on economic growth in 23 European Union (EU) member states in the period 1990–2020. Besides overall renewable energy consumption, different utilisations of this energy are considered: in industry, transport, in commercial and public services, and for residential purposes. The methodological background is built around panel data models that start from a Cobb–Douglas function. The renewable energy consumption is considered an important factor that should generate economic growth. The panel data approach based on causality analysis and Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators suggests that renewable energy use in industry does not determine economic growth, but economic development is a cause for more utilisation of this energy in industry. In addition, more renewable energy consumption in transport enhances economic growth. A high level of economic development can promote the consumption of renewable energies in industrial sectors. In this way, industrial companies can allocate more financial funds to research in the field of renewable energies and can afford to adopt renewable energy sources. Investment in biofuels can contribute to achieving sustainable transport in the EU.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To improve the calibration accuracy and calibration efficiency of cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) for new items and, ultimately, contribute to the widespread application of CD-CAT in practice, the current article proposed a Gini-based online calibration method that can simultaneously calibrate the Q-matrix and item parameters of new items. Three simulation studies with simulated and real item banks were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the joint estimation algorithm (JEA) and the single-item estimation (SIE) methods. The results indicated that the proposed Gini-based online calibration method yielded higher calibration efficiency than those of the SIE method and outperformed the JEA method on item calibration tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency under most experimental conditions.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Recognizing the need for scientific fidelity and balanced representation in the evidence that informs public policy, this study investigates technical and issue bias in 43 policy briefs and state handbooks that provided information about the use of Student Learning Objectives to evaluate teachers’ performance. The author uses multiple qualitative methods to categorize the contributors to the focal documents, identify the evidence they drew upon, and determine how they represented the information to their targeted audiences. The study reinforces the findings of prior research by documenting the outsized impact of advocacy groups in a policy-related evidence base. The results make an important addition to the scholarly literature by cataloging an array of technical assistance providers that translated and disseminated evidence to decision makers and spotlighting the various ways biased information appeared in the publications. Throughout, the study reinforces how incentives and timing shape evidence production and use in policymaking.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines the effects of English Learner (EL) status on subsequent Special Education (SPED) placement. Through a research-practice partnership, we link student demographic data and initial English proficiency assessment data across seven cohorts of test takers and observe EL and SPED programmatic participation for these students over 7 years. Our regression discontinuity (RD) estimates at the English proficiency margin consistently differ substantively from positive associations generated through regression analyses. RD evidence indicates that EL status had no effect on SPED placement at the English proficiency threshold. Grade-by-grade and subgroup RD analyses at this margin suggest that ELs were modestly underidentified for SPED during Grade 5 and that ELs whose primary language was Spanish were underidentified for SPED.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Monetary policy changes have an irreplaceable impact on economic activity. Considering the close linkage among economic policies, we employ a bi-directional Granger causality test to investigate the potential linkages between monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) and other categorical economic policy uncertainty (CEPU) in the time and frequency domains. We consider all news-based U.S. categorical economic policy uncertainty indices (CEPU). All monthly CEPU indicators, covering January 1986 to January 2022, can be obtained from the website of Economic Policy Uncertainty. On an average, causality running from each CEPU to MPU is not apparent, while MPU can significantly affect six policy-related uncertainties: taxes, government spending, health care, national security, entitlement programs and regulation. A further frequency-domain study showed the dynamic changes in the relationship between them. For instance, we capture mid- and long-run causality running from tax uncertainty to MPU, while MPU has an impact on taxes in the medium run. Our findings provide policymakers with a better understanding of the nexus between MPU and other CEPU for formulating appropriate economic policies. Particularly, if a sectional government considers the long- and short-term effects of different policies when formulating strategies, risk transmission may be curbed to some extent.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics interest is highly relevant for students’ academical and emotional development in the domain of mathematics. Thus, it appears alarming that students’ mathematics interest decreases during the course of secondary school. Teacher self-efficacy is a central facet of teacher motivation and is assumed to be highly relevant for student mathematics interest. However, there is a paucity of research that investigates the longitudinal and indirect relations through which teacher self-efficacy relates to students’ interest through their teaching behaviors in mathematics classrooms. Therefore, in the present longitudinal study we aim to contribute to research by identifying how teacher self-efficacy for student engagement contributes to students’ mathematics interest in secondary classrooms through student- and teacher-reported support. We used a sample of mathematics teachers (n = 50) and their students (n = 959). Longitudinal data of three measurement waves collected from German ninth grade mathematics classrooms were included in the analysis. Results of latent-manifest multi-level analysis showed that teacher self-efficacy for student engagement at Time 1 (beginning of ninth grade) positively predicted student-perceived, but not teacher-perceived, teacher emotional support at Time 2 (beginning of tenth grade), which in turn positively predicted students’ mathematics interest at Time 3 (middle of tenth grade). A possible implication for mathematics teachers’ educational practice involves strengthening mathematics teachers’ self-efficacy for student engagement by means of direct interventions and in-servive training for mathematics teachers.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in community colleges. Yet, there is limited empirical information on the design parameters necessary to plan the sample size for RCTs in this context. We provide empirical estimates of key design parameters, discussing lessons based on the pattern of estimates across outcomes, semesters, and studies. Nearly all RCTs in community colleges use student random assignment within blocks (colleges or cohorts). Key design parameters for the minimum detectable true effect (MDTE) are the within-block outcome standard deviation [math] and the within-block outcome variance explained by baseline covariates like student characteristics [math]. The main analyses use student-level data from 8 to 14 RCTs including 5,649–7,099 students (depending on the outcome) with follow-up data for 3 years. A public database created for this paper includes parameter estimates for 30 RCTs including 65,637 students. Enrollment, credits earned, credential attainment, and grade point average. The within-block standard deviation [math] and therefore the MDTE can be much larger in later semesters for enrollment outcomes and cumulative credits earned. There is substantial variation across studies in [math] for degree attainment. Baseline covariates explain less than 10% of the variation in student outcomes. When planning the sample size for a study, researchers should be mindful of the follow-up period, use a range of values to calculate the MDTE for outcomes that vary across studies, and assume a value of [math] between 0 and 0.05.

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we consider mathematical competitions for pre-university students, such as the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) and many national and regional Olympiads following a similar model. The problems proposed in these contests must be solvable by ‘elementary’ methods (i.e., without using calculus) and belong traditionally to four areas, namely, algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. Usually there is no explicit curriculum prescribing what parts of these subjects may be involved in the problems, however there is a hidden curriculum (HC) that may be deduced from the problems proposed and from what is considered a complete solution. In this paper, we try to characterize this HC showing typical problems, subjects, solutions, and strategies for each of the main areas. We also make a comparison of the HC with the traditional secondary school curriculum (SSC), with the following two goals: (1) to identify the main points that should be addressed in the preparation of students aspiring to participate in mathematical competitions, and (2) to suggest possible changes to it and diminish the gap between school and contemporary mathematics.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Competitions and related activities are an essential part of mathematics education for gifted students. China has been one of the most successful countries in recent decades in the International Mathematical Olympiad. To illustrate the Chinese experience of mathematics competitions, in this paper we first present a historical sketch of Chinese mathematics competitions, then provide a comprehensive description of its pyramidal selection and training systems, including the introduction of main competitions for high school students, some examples of competition problems, and the training of students and tutors. Furthermore, to investigate the influence of mathematics competitions on contestants, an empirical study of 372 former contestants was conducted and is reported. The results showed that most of the contestants majored in mathematics or areas closely related to mathematics. Nearly half of the contestants intended to do mathematics research or work highly related to mathematics. A majority of the contestants held positive attitudes toward their mathematics competition experiences and affirmed the value of these experiences in cultivating personal interests and developing mathematics abilities. Some negative influences of competition experiences on contestants are also identified. Finally, problems existing in the development of Chinese mathematics competitions and future research directions are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics Challenge for Young Australians is a unique enrichment program that has been produced annually by the Australian Mathematics Trust since 1991. In its present form, it is divided into four levels and caters for talented students from years 3 to 10. In a typical year, it attracts over 15,000 entries. Individual schools arrange a period of up to four weeks in the first half of the academic year for students to work on their prescribed set of the problems and write full solutions. Limited collaboration among students is permitted and encouraged. There is a strong emphasis on articulating clearly the reasoning in solutions with sound and complete presentation. A guide containing marking schemes is provided for teachers to help them assess their students' work. It also includes discussion points and extension questions, which are relevant to each problem and may be used by the teacher for further enrichment activity. This paper discusses the history, aims, and structure of the program. It describes how problems are designed by the Challenge Committee to engage the students and develop their problem-solving skills. A range of past Challenge problems are presented to illustrate their construction, diversity, levels of difficulty, and relevance to educational objectives.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematical competitions feature in most developed countries as a part of the secondary school experience, but to a lesser extent in developing countries. In this paper we investigate how widespread these competitions are in Africa, both historically as well as currently, focussing both on national Olympiads and on the participation of African countries in competitions beyond their borders, such as the continent-wide Pan African Mathematical Olympiad and the global International Mathematical Olympiad. Since we could not find a consolidated source of information on African competitions, we include many details and links, hoping that this paper will serve as a valuable starting point for future investigators. Next, we present some survey findings on the attitudes towards and experiences of mathematical competitions, both from the perspective of teachers in secondary schools as well as from secondary school students, and whether these experiences have served to improve or degrade their perceptions of mathematics in general. Among other results, we find that teachers view their students’ participation in mathematics competitions as being important, with the biggest barrier to participation being that there are not enough competitions at appropriate levels available, and that students enjoy mathematics competitions and are more likely to pursue a STEM career because of them. Finally, we present some suggestions on how this research may be taken further, and on how the state of mathematical competition culture in Africa may be improved.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The Iberoamerican Mathematics Olympiad (IbMO) is one of the most successful and established regional Olympiads in the world with the participation of all Iberoamerican countries. Its origins are a confluence of two mayor events: on the one hand the organization of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the Americas for the very first time in 1981 and on the other hand a Latin American effort for the modernization and improvement of mathematics education embodied by the CIAEM—Comité Interamericano de Educación Matemática (or, alternately, the Congreso Interamericano de Educación Matemática). This localized Olympiad with a more homogeneous population proved very quickly to be an important steppingstone for Iberoamerican countries to prepare their participation in the IMO resulting in a collaborative effort to improve mathematics education in the region. Other very successful smaller regional mathematics Olympiads in Iberoamerica sprouted from this effort as well as from Iberoamerican efforts to establish similar experiences for other cohorts of students, such as younger students, university students and students of other sciences. In that same decade, other regional olympiads were born around the world, such as the Pan African Mathematics Olympiad (1987), the Asian Pacific (1989) or the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (1985). Their impact in the regions was appreciated, recognized and adapted to other regional Olympiads worldwide.</p>

                    <p>The nature of the area of mathematical competitions as a design science is considered, historical roots of mathematical problem-solving competitions are traced, the complementary aspects of mathematics as theory building and as problem solving are touched upon in relation to the practice of competitions. Two historical figures, Euler and Erdős, emerge, and the appropriateness of many of Euler’s mathematical ventures are seen as role models for competition mathematics as first put into practice in mathematical competitions towards the end of the nineteenth century. Distinctions and definitions are made, a venture into identifying competition syllabi and the principal types of reasoning employed in solving competition problems is explored, and a description of the many different types of competitions is considered. Interaction between the field of mathematics itself and problem-solving competitions is briefly explored, as are the possibilities that open when competitions and their access to huge amounts of data, both national and international, are taken into account in research belonging to mathematics education. Finally, the range of topics addressed in this special issue of ZDM is covered, along with some possible conclusions relating to the components of the overview.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions (WFNMC) was founded in 1984 as a professional organization that provides the possibility of international collaboration among mathematicians and mathematics educators working in the area of mathematics contests. Over the last decades the field, which has come to be called “competition mathematics for school students”, has developed new methods for two important activities in mathematics education, namely, problem posing and problem solving. Because of this development, competition mathematics has shaped itself into a separate branch of mathematics education with its particular features, trends and needs. It not only contains the seeds of many fields of contemporary mathematics, but has also stimulated rich contributions to important research areas of mathematics education, in the intersection of the interests of both professional communities. Mathematics competitions serve also to identify mathematical talent worldwide and to promote the attraction of young people of higher ability to professional careers in mathematics. In many cases, problems posed in mathematical contests inspire mathematical research and new methods of teaching mathematician. In this paper I briefly describe the history of WFNMC. I focus on the main activities of the Federation, including conferences, awards, publications, and research areas of the members. As the only international professional organization in this field, the WFNMC supports activities that have their own particular significance, which are discussed in the paper.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>For a century and a half, the scene of mathematics competitions underwent a remarkable transformation from isolated and geographically scattered events to a full-scale and a full-featured vibrant global ecosystem comprising an impressive variety of competitions, school students, university students, teachers, mentors, scientists, schools, universities, research institutions, journals, websites, civil society organizations, educational authorities, parents, etc. The evolution, the current state, the functioning of this ecosystem as well as its role for the identification and development of talent, its impact on the educational process, and the institutions involved with it, is briefly reflected on. Some relatively new online competitions are presented that cultivate the use of dynamic geometry software systems for a deeper understanding of mathematical facts and phenomena, and for finding approximate numerical solutions to problems that are not part of a typical school curriculum, but often arise from real-life practice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This article presents the results of a small-scale, comparative study on the perceived impact that having students enter Mathematics competitions has on Mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the UK and on their classroom practice. The study surveyed a small number of Mathematics teachers in the three countries who teach in both public and private schools and in both rural and urban regions. The perceived advantages and disadvantages to students from taking part in competitions and to teachers who have students taking part in competitions are discussed and the findings compared across the three countries. The effect that Mathematics competitions have on the identification and development of the mathematical talent of students is considered together with the contribution of these activities to the academic environment of the classroom. For the teachers who did have students taking Mathematics competitions, the limitations of entry and the different methods in which teachers prepare or assist students to prepare for the competitions are compared between countries. Since the study is small in scale, no firm conclusions are drawn but suggestions are made as to where future, larger scale, studies might be carried out to see if the classroom experiences of all could be positively influenced by exposure to Mathematics competitions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The International Mathematical Olympiad, now 62 years old, has catalyzed the formation of a remarkable international community that meets for 2 weeks each year to celebrate mathematical problem solving. It has influenced and expanded the greater global mathematical culture, and the value of problem-solving in numerous countries. It is time for the mathematics competition community to reach out and pose questions for serious inquiry. What is the extent of this influence? What are its effects? Reciprocally, what effects have different mathematical traditions had on the IMO? Some significant studies have been done to answer such questions, but several remain unanswered, and most remain unposed. We survey the work that has been done, then some anecdotal evidence, including case studies of the participation of individual countries in the IMO. We then suggest some topics needing a deeper inquiry. The intention of this article is to invite the research community to work with the IMO community in a serious investigation of the half-century of experience afforded us by the IMO.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In 2005, the Brazilian Public Schools Math Olympics (OBMEP) was created by the Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada. Since then, around 18 million students from the sixth to the twelfth grades have taken part in the competition annually. In each year of the competition, 6500 medals are distributed to public school students. In the following year these students receive a scholarship to participate in a training program disseminated in 225 centers across the country. Perceiving that the greatest impact of OBMEP has occurred in schools engaged with the Olympics, in either the preparation of their students for the competition or the promotion of award ceremonies for students classified as eligible for the second stage, in 2014 OBMEP launched a teacher training program. This article reviews the various OBMEP programs, their objectives and their impacts, and analyzes the obstacles faced. It also discusses the gender gap observed in the Math Olympics. In Brazil, the STEM areas of study, namely the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, attract fewer girls than boys. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the OBMEP. The performance of girls is inferior to that of boys. This distinction is accentuated with the age of the students and in the grades of students in the upper percentiles of the exam.</p>
