  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to the lockdown of schools in many countries, forcing teachers and students to carry out educational activities remotely. In the case of mathematics, developing remote instruction based on both synchronous and asynchronous technological solutions has proven to be an extremely complex challenge. Specifically, this was the case in topics such as word problem solving, as this domain requires intensive supervision and feedback from the teacher. In this piece of research, we present an evaluation of how technology is employed in the teaching of mathematics, with particular relevance to learning during the pandemic. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic review, revealing the almost complete absence of experiments in which the use of technology is not mediated by the teacher. These results reflect a pessimistic vision within the field of mathematics education about the possibilities of learning when the student uses technology autonomously. Bringing good outcomes out of a bad situation, the pandemic crisis may represent a turning point from which to start directing the research gaze towards technological environments such as those mediated by artificial intelligence. As an example, we provide a study illustrating to what extent intelligent tutoring systems can be cost-effective compared to one-to-one human tutoring and mathematic learning-oriented solutions for intensive supervision in the teaching of word problem solving, especially appropriate for remote settings. Despite the potential of these technologies, the experience also showed that student socioeconomic level was a determining factor in the participation rate with an intelligent tutoring system, regardless of whether or not the administration guaranteed students' access to technological resources during the COVID-19 situation.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we describe an experiment in using history to work on problem-solving and the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. The students involved attended the first year of the Italian upper secondary school (grade 9). The original sources we used are problems from Italian treatises on arithmetic and algebra that appeared in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. At the beginning, we present these treatises, which belong to a widespread mathematical tradition. We then describe the classroom experiment: we administered 14 problems from ancient treatises accompanied by the request to solve them and write impressions and comments. Data were collected through written protocols and interviews. The analysis of the results focused on the strategies implemented in solving the problems, with particular reference to the use of arithmetic and algebra, and on the perception of the cultural aspect introduced by these problems in the students’ approach to mathematics. The findings show the difficulties of some students on topics, such as fractions and direct proportionality, which should have been acquired in earlier school years. Combining the use of history with aspects of research in mathematics education allowed us to outline some teaching implications linked to the use of history.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This research investigates how a lesson study (LS) on designing and implementing challenging tasks impacts Vietnamese high school mathematics teacher knowledge and beliefs. Its contribution highlights cultural considerations when adopting LS to the forefront to contextualize the impacts. The results show that the teachers developed their specialized content knowledge by attending to students’ mathematics and creating cognitive conflicts building on student responses. The teachers changed their curriculum knowledge from implementer to transformer, improved knowledge about content and students attending to difficulties and misconceptions, and enhanced their knowledge about content and teaching in ways they designed, sequenced, and evaluated approaches that fit student learning. Finally, they changed their beliefs about mathematics to a comprehensive view of knowledge, mathematical proficiency, and sophisticated beliefs of teaching and learning. Discussion about the essence of LS when adopting it to different cultures is included.

  Abstract
                  <p>While recovering from a major personal tipping point (see Part I), I was still able to keep on the lookout for Canadian mathematics education matters. After all, if Canadian mathematics education matters, Canadian mathematics education matters. In doing so, I ran into a number of other financial problems. Everywhere I turned was a financial problem: from tipping in the sharing (or platform) economy; to spending your way to savings with credit cards; the proliferation of sportsbooks and online casinos; trying to reconcile the Canadian cost of living with the seemingly high accepted standard level of consumption; and the outrageous fee to take $20 out of my very own bank account. Each taken on their own, I clearly have some financial problems. Taken together, I contend that ‘Egan’s Financial Problems’, albeit unconventional, could, one day, be the impetus for financial education and literacy leaving math class and becoming a class of its own in Canadian schools. Until then, I guess we go with the School of Hard Knocks for our financial education.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Since its introduction as an analytic and theoretical tool for the examination of racism in education, CRT scholarship has proliferated as the most visible critical theory of race in educational research. Whereas CRT’s popularity can be viewed as a welcome sign, scholars continually caution against its misappropriation and overuse, which dilute its criticality. We draw from the cautionary ethos of this canon of literature as the impetus for examining CRT’s terrain in social studies education research. Starting from Ladson-Billings’s watershed edited CRT text on race and social studies in 2003, this study provides a comprehensive theoretical review of scholarly literature in the social studies education field pertinent to the nexus of CRT, racialized citizenship, and race(ism). To guide our review, we asked how social studies education scholars have defined and used CRT as an analytic and theoretical framework in social studies education research from 2004 to 2019, as well as how scholars have positioned CRT within social studies education research to foreground the relationship between citizenship and race. Overall, findings from our theoretical review illustrated that contrary to the proliferation of CRT in educational research, CRT was slow to catch on as a theoretical and analytic framework in social studies education, as only seven of the articles in our analysis were published between 2004 and 2010. However, CRT emerged as a viable framework for the examination of race, racism, and racialized citizenship between 2011 and 2019, with a majority of these studies emphasizing (a) the centrality of race as a core tenet of CRT, (b) idealist interrogations of race, (c) the perspectives of teachers of color and White teachers in learning how to teach about race, and (d) the role of race and racism in curricular analyses that serve as counternarrative to the master script of the nation’s linear social progress in social studies education.

  Abstract
                  <p>Lockdowns imposed by many countries on their populations at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis forced teachers to adapt quickly and without adequate preparation to distance teaching. In this paper, we focus on one of the most formidable challenges that teachers faced during the lockdowns and even in the post-lockdown emergency period, namely, developing assessment that maintains the pedagogical continuity that educational institutions typically require. Based on the results of a previous study, focused on the analysis of answers to an open-ended questionnaire administered to a population of 700 teachers from France, Germany, Israel and Italy, a semi-structured interview series was designed and implemented by the authors of this paper with a small group of teachers. The transcripts of these interviews were analysed according to the interpretative phenomenological analysis methodology, with the aim of investigating teachers’ own perspectives on the following: (a) the difficulties with which they had to contend, with respect to the question of assessment; (b) the techniques adopted to deal with these difficulties; and (c) the ways in which the lockdown experience could affect the future evolution of teachers’ assessment practices. This analysis supported us in formulating hypotheses concerning the possible long-term effects of lockdown on modes of assessment in mathematics.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>We present results from a meta-analysis of 37 contemporary experimental and quasi-experimental studies of summer programs in mathematics for children in grades pre-K–12, examining what resources and characteristics predict stronger student achievement. Children who participated in summer programs that included mathematics activities experienced significantly better mathematics achievement outcomes compared to their control group counterparts. We find an average weighted impact estimate of +0.10 standard deviations on mathematics achievement outcomes. We find similar effects for programs conducted in higher- and lower-poverty settings. We undertook a secondary analysis exploring the effect of summer programs on noncognitive outcomes and found positive mean impacts. The results indicate that summer programs are a promising tool to strengthen children’s mathematical proficiency outside of school time.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP; e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1995) is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to serve culturally and linguistically diverse student learners. Although a large body of work describes its tenets and permutations, and its implications for students, less work has been done to outline the myriad barriers that teachers face when trying to implement CRP. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a race-conscious, multilevel, ecological framework to illuminate the societal, institutional, and individual obstacles that teachers must navigate in the pursuit of CRP. Implications for teacher training and development are discussed.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Differential item functioning (DIF) occurs when the probability of endorsing an item differs across groups for individuals with the same latent trait level. The presence of DIF items may jeopardize the validity of an instrument; therefore, it is crucial to identify DIF items in routine operations of educational assessment. While DIF detection procedures based on item response theory (IRT) have been widely used, a majority of IRT-based DIF tests assume predefined anchor (i.e., DIF-free) items. Not only is this assumption strong, but violations to it may also lead to erroneous inferences, for example, an inflated Type I error rate. We propose a general framework to define the effect sizes of DIF without a priori knowledge of anchor items. In particular, we quantify DIF by item-specific residuals from a regression model fitted to the true item parameters in respective groups. Moreover, the null distribution of the proposed test statistic using robust estimator can be derived analytically or approximated numerically even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, which yields asymptotically justified statistical inference. The Type I error rate and the power performance of the proposed procedure are evaluated and compared with the conventional likelihood-ratio DIF tests in a Monte Carlo experiment. Our simulation study has shown promising results in controlling Type I error rate and power of detecting DIF items. Even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, the true and false alarm rate can be well controlled when a robust regression estimator is used.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we provide an overall perspective on the teaching and learning of discrete mathematics. Our aim is to highlight what research has been conducted in this area and to connect it to existing research ideas for future work. We begin by characterizing discrete mathematics and its role in the school curriculum, highlighting themes, topics, and mathematical practices that distinguish discrete mathematics. We then present potential benefits of focusing on discrete mathematics topics for mathematics education; in particular, we discuss the accessibility of topics in discrete mathematics, the connection to mathematical processes and affect, and the relevance of discrete mathematics in our current society. We also emphasize discrete mathematics from an international perspective, highlighting studies from the US, Italy, France, Chile, and Germany, which are across all school levels–primary, middle, and secondary school, and with some implications for post-secondary education. We particularly discuss discrete topics including number theory, combinatorics, iteration and recursion, graph theory, and discrete games and puzzles; we describe and situate these topics within literature. We also suggest the additional topics of game theory and the mathematics of fairness that we hope to see addressed in future studies.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Teachers’ questioning plays an essential role in shaping collective argumentative discourse. This paper demonstrated that rationality dimensions in teacher questions can be assessed by adapting Habermas’ three components of rationality. By coordinating Habermas’ construct with Toulmin’s model for argumentation, this paper investigated how two secondary mathematics teachers used rational questioning to support student participation in collective argumentation. This paper identified various ways in which two participating teachers used rational questioning to support student participation in argumentation via contributions of argument components. The results establish a theoretical connection between the use of rational questions and students’ contributions of components of arguments. The results indicated that not all rational questions were associated with a component of argument, and rational questions may additionally support argumentation in general for the development of a culture of rationality. The study has implications in terms of theory and professional development of teachers.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>New York City’s school system is among the most diverse and segregated in the United States. Using difference-in-differences and placebo tests, we evaluate two desegregation policies in two geographic districts in New York City, District 3 and District 15. Both districts attempted to lower economic segregation within their district while maintaining school choice, prioritizing economically disadvantaged students for middle school seats in advance of the 2019–2020 school year. District 15, however, set more ambitious prioritization targets and also chose to eliminate academic screens from all middle schools. We find that District 15’s policy lowered economic segregation in sixth grade by 55% and racial segregation by 38%, while District 3’s policy led to no significant change in segregation.
