  Abstract
                  <p>Students’ attitudes can be influential in the emotions experienced in mathematics learning and achievement at school. Two important judgements, according to Control-Value Theory are degree of control a student has over, and the value attached to, learning activities or outcomes. Appraisals of control and value are believed to play a central role in the emotions experienced when learning, and subsequent achievement. Achievement, in turn, can strengthen or weaken control-value appraisals. In the present study we set out to examine the bidirectional relations between control-value appraisals and a key emotion experienced in the mathematics classroom, namely anxiety. In addition, we tested the proposition that control-value appraisals are indirectly linked to achievement, mediated by classroom-related anxiety. The participants were 1242 Year 5 students (49% female), with a mean of 9.3 years, from 24 English primary schools. Self-report data for anxiety, and control-value appraisals, were collected over two waves (separated by seven months) and mathematics achievement collected from a classroom test one week later. Results from a structural equation model showed bidirectional relations between higher anxiety and lower control. Although anxiety predicted lower value, value was unrelated to subsequent anxiety. Higher control at the first wave of measurement was related to higher mathematics achievement, mediated by lower anxiety, at the second wave. These results underscore the importance of reducing anxiety when learning mathematics and suggest that intervention could achieve this outcome by reducing anxiety directly or by strengthening control.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>From a teacher’s perspective, teacher learning happens through a complex web of learning experiences. However, research on teacher professional development (PD) typically focuses on the direct influence of single activities or programs. PD researchers less often acknowledge the interactive impacts on teacher learning of the multiple experiences teachers have in different contexts. This conceptual paper works toward a more thoroughgoing ecological framing of teacher PD by bringing forth three dimensions of teacher learning that are often overlooked: scope, interconnectedness, and temporality. The essay centers on the type of design that is widely considered high-quality PD—namely, experiences that are collaborative and situated in teachers’ instructional context—and considers those experiences from the perspective of these three dimensions. I illustrate this framework and its affordances with data from a 4-year research project rooted in video-based mathematics teacher conversations. The focus on scope allows researchers to name and distinguish contexts that are salient to their different studies. The focus on interconnectedness uncovers the interactive relationship between the immediate and broader PD contexts. Finally, the focus on temporality affords the understanding of different phases in learning and extends linear conceptions of progress. Together, these dimensions provide a rich conceptualization to better inform the work of teacher educators.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Nontraditional students seeking a teaching license are tasked with managing coursework and other responsibilities associated with teacher preparation programs; however, they are also likely navigating family dynamics, financial struggles, and other obligations that traditional undergraduate students do not face. We interviewed 19 preservice teacher candidates and report on their experiences when selecting their university of choice, the barriers they faced, and the supports they received. Participants reported coming to their university because of cost, location, and reputation. They reported common barriers such as inability to work, caring for children, and lack of support or access to other resources. However, participants reported professors and external funding as the major factors that had helped them succeed. Implications about this diverse group of students are discussed.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In the present study, we examine whether characteristics of student teaching sites and cooperating teachers predict teacher candidates’ edTPA scores. Using data from North Carolina, we find that candidates earn higher edTPA scores if they student-taught in a high value-added school and with a cooperating teacher earning higher evaluation ratings. Evidence also suggests that candidates earn higher scores when they are mentored by a cooperating teacher who is more familiar with performance assessments. Finally, we find that the relationships between student teaching environments and edTPA scores vary by characteristics of the candidate. This study reinforces prior work on the importance of learning environments to teacher development and the importance of preparation programs securing placements in high-quality learning environments. Our results may also have implications for the use of performance assessments by states and preparation programs.

The meanings of participation and reification and how their dialectical relation was applied and reflected in the MPDP design. Several related applications to participation and reification are discussed and three aspects are proposed for future studies.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>We set out to investigate preservice teachers’ beliefs about sources of teaching knowledge and their motivation to learn from practice and theory in teacher education in a longitudinal study (n = 96, at the beginning of the study). Participants placed more trust in experiential knowledge sources compared with formalized sources and participants’ beliefs about sources of teaching knowledge generally predicted their motivation to learn from different sources. Quantitative results were further supported and elaborated by qualitative interview data that suggested development of preservice teachers’ beliefs about sources of teaching knowledge and their understanding of the relation between theoretical and practical knowledge over time. The findings extend existing literature by providing a window on how (preservice) teachers may articulate their views about sources of teaching knowledge and relations between theory and practice, with expected consequences for teaching practice. Implications for teacher educators’ practice are also discussed.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Examining the connections among teacher characteristics, instructional decision-making, and student learning in social studies education are both complicated and contentious. In the current study, we shed light on middle grades social studies teaching and learning—a black hole of research in the subject area. Using data from the National Assessment for Education Progress (NAEP) eighth grade U.S. history assessment, we explore the intersections of eighth grade social studies teachers’ teacher education pathways, instructional, decision-making, and curricular structure on students’ knowledge of history. Results suggest that teachers identified as having a social studies-inclusive teacher education background and who only teach social studies (as opposed to multiple subjects) were associated with higher average student performance on the NAEP exam. Findings have implications for middle grades social studies teacher education and how the subject is organized within middle schools.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Chile is known for universal school choice policies and a high level of economic segregation. In part, segregation has been linked to selective school admission policies. Chile implemented a centralized school admission system (New School Admission System), where PK–12 schools must accept any applicant, and lottery assignment is used for oversubscription. We exploit a natural experiment due to the phased implementation across grades and regions to attempt to detect any effects of this policy on access for and representation of low-income students using grade-within-school and year fixed effects. Eliminating admissions barriers may contribute to increased educational opportunity, but the impact may be limited by the multiple structural factors shaping inequality in Chile. We find little short-term change in access for low-income students.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Scholars have called for promoting coherence in teacher education programs. Such coherence is often depicted as a state to be achieved. This article reconceptualizes coherence as a dynamic process affected by the simultaneous organizational realities of unity, conflict, and fragmentation; it also aims to clarify factors that can facilitate or challenge the work of enhancing teacher education program coherence. Drawing on a case study of program-wide redesign, we show that promoting coherence requires more than just maximizing unity (instructors’ agreement on means and ends). It also requires addressing conflict and recognizing fragmentation in ways that support what we term “pathway flexibility.” By highlighting the interplay of unity, conflict, and fragmentation, we offer a set of conceptual tools to understand and support the development of program coherence in teacher education.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>We used multivariate generalizability theory to examine the reliability of hand-scoring and automated essay scoring (AES) and to identify how these scoring methods could be used in conjunction to optimize writing assessment. Students (n = 113) included subsamples of struggling writers and non-struggling writers in Grades 3–5 drawn from a larger study. Students wrote six essays across three genres. All essays were hand-scored by four raters and an AES system called Project Essay Grade (PEG). Both scoring methods were highly reliable, but PEG was more reliable for non-struggling students, while hand-scoring was more reliable for struggling students. We provide recommendations regarding ways of optimizing writing assessment and blending hand-scoring with AES.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Although scholarship documenting the effects of racism on educational outcomes is extensive, less empirical research has been done on interventions designed to mitigate racism and racial bias in schools. Based on case studies of two elementary schools, we have found that educators participating in a yearlong racial justice program demonstrated a deeper understanding of their own racial biases, developed a shared language to identify and name different forms of racism, and reported greater confidence to disrupt racist incidents in their schools. In one site, however, inconsistent leadership and resistance from a vocal White minority limited the program’s potential to change schoolwide practice. In the other site, educators reported changes in curricular materials and changes to disciplinary decisions, but widespread organizational change will likely take longer than a single school year. Drawing on these findings, we discuss implications for anti-racist interventions in other educational contexts as well as recommendations for studying their efficacy.

  Abstract
                  <p>In mathematics education, translation of resources from one language to another occurs in a wide range of situations. This paper explores how conceptual and technical apparatus from contemporary translation studies may be of use in guiding and analysing such translation. Key concepts—including those of source, target and intermediate text, of paradigms of equivalence, purpose, uncertainty and localisation, and of semantic, syntactic and epistemological equivalence—are introduced and illustrated, primarily with reference to translation of a series of school mathematics workbooks. Significant types of tool to assist translation—translation protocols and machine translation—are examined. A more detailed case study illustrates techniques (and associated tools) for analysing translation shifts and terminological translatability, applying them to examine translation of documentation of a framework for researching teachers’ interaction with resources—the Documentational Approach to Didactics. Specific insights that emerge are how translation is shaped by attention not just to fidelity to the source text but to the audience for, and function of, the target text; and how challenging it can be to formulate terms translatable across languages in such a way as to consistently anchor meaning in existing wordforms.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The introduction of programming activities in the classroom has given rise to a variety of teaching methods. Some methods focus on learning to code while others take a creative programming approach (Resnick &amp; Rusk, 2020). This study looks at creative programming as an opportunity for students to develop their reasoning skills. Drawing from both mathematics teaching and creative programming practices, we identify the elements of informatics thinking and use them to analyze the behaviour of students during a programming task in educational robotics. We also apply certain conceptual tools from both the field of mathematics teaching and the framework of informatics thinking in the course of our study. Creative programming practices provide six factors for analyzing how the students approached situational problems, framed the problems, learned the code, and developed the programs. From a didactics perspective, we use the components of DeBlois’ model (2001, 2003) for interpreting cognitive activities to analyze elements in the knowledge-building process. Our article ends with a comparison of the benefits of each analytical framework, which could have implications for teacher training on programming in the classroom.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To address response style or bias in rating scales, forced-choice items are often used to request that respondents rank their attitudes or preferences among a limited set of options. The rating scales used by raters to render judgments on ratees’ performance also contribute to rater bias or errors; consequently, forced-choice items have recently been employed for raters to rate how a ratee performs in certain defined traits. This study develops forced-choice ranking models (FCRMs) for data analysis when performance is evaluated by external raters or experts in a forced-choice ranking format. The proposed FCRMs consider different degrees of raters’ leniency/severity when modeling the selection probability in the generalized unfolding item response theory framework. They include an additional topic facet when multiple tasks are evaluated and incorporate variations in leniency parameters to capture the interactions between ratees and raters. The simulation results indicate that the parameters of the new models can be satisfactorily recovered and that better parameter recovery is associated with more item blocks, larger sample sizes, and a complete ranking design. A technological creativity assessment is presented as an empirical example with which to demonstrate the applicability and implications of the new models.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The important role of individual differences in affecting teachers’ involvement in and professional development through research has received little systematic attention in theoretical discussions and empirical studies on teacher research. Therefore, relying on the available literature and our proposed theoretical models, we investigated the possible links among language teachers’ Big Five personality traits, motivation to conduct research (through self-determination theory’s intrinsic and extrinsic motivations alongside the avoidance motivation construct), and teacher research involvement (TRI). Using a survey method, data were gathered from 253 Iranian school English teachers (SETs) and subjected to correlational and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses. Notably, SEM results demonstrated that Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism significantly predicted the motivational constructs which themselves predicted TRI. Moreover, the effects of these four traits on TRI were fully mediated through the motivational constructs. Implications for theory, policymaking, and professional development in the teacher research field are proposed.
