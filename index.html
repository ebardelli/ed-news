  Abstract
                  <p>According to expectancy-value models, two important motivational constructs are task value and self-efficacy expectations. As students work intensively on mathematical problems in the classroom, teachers need the competence to judge whether students value solving the problem and how confident they are that they will succeed. However, not much is known about the mechanisms behind teachers’ judgments concerning students’ motivation. The goal of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (a) How do preservice teachers rate their own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (b) Are there differences in preservice teachers’ diagnostic judgments concerning school students’ task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems? (c) Do preservice teachers’ own task value and self-efficacy for modelling, word, and intramathematical problems differ from preservice teachers’ judgments of school students’ task value and self-efficacy? A total of 182 preservice teachers were asked about the value of 12 problems, their confidence in solving the problems, and how hypothetical ninth graders would judge these constructs. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own perceptions regarding both constructs were lower for modelling problems than for other problems. When judging school students’ motivation, ratings of both constructs were higher for word problems. Preservice teachers’ ratings of their own motivation were significantly higher across all types of problems than their judgments of school students’ perspectives. A positive correlation between preservice teachers’ own motivation and their judgments of school students’ motivation indicates the importance of teachers’ perceptions of their own motivation to solve mathematical problems for diagnostic judgments.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the role and scope of historical knowledge in work on using history of mathematics in education. This work can come from three types of actors, namely, teachers, teacher trainers, and educational researchers. The texts written by these actors show that their objectives and practices can be different, as is the historical knowledge they deploy. We can read writings of teachers who seek to ‘give meaning’ to school knowledge, by integrating original texts into their teaching progression. We also can read writings of educational researchers who prepare ‘history capsules’ for teachers, which can be introduced into teaching from time to time. To carry out this research, I focus on analyzing the complex relationships between the following three poles: objectives, pedagogical practices, and historical knowledge. To this end, I use the notion of ideal types introduced and developed by the sociologist Max Weber. Section 1 is devoted to the construction of ideal types corresponding to my aim. Based on these ideal types, in Sect. 2, I elaborate on the role and scope of historical knowledge in concrete situations where the history of mathematics is used; specifically, on the one hand during the reading of original texts in an educational context, and on the other hand, in the particular context of teachers education. Some further comments are made in the third and last section.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we document the support provided by highly recognised journals in Mathematics Education in response to the challenges faced by English non-dominant language (EnDL) authors when they attempt to publish in English. To address this issue, we first conducted a synthesis of research literature related to those influences that direct EnDL authors’ publication efforts towards English language journals and the associated challenges that result. Second, we gathered survey and interview data from participant editors-in-chief of leading journals in Mathematics Education about the support, enacted and planned, provided by their journal for EnDL authors and associated challenges. Finally, we discuss the findings of the study from the perspective of heteroglossia. Findings indicate that while a range of initiatives have been employed to support EnDL authors, current journal policies lag somewhat behind the plans of editors-in-chief, which have been limited, to date, by available resources.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, China, all school classes were delivered through an online environment from February 24 to May 22, 2020. To support this transition, the Shanghai Education Commission led expert teachers and specialists to develop a series of online video lessons based on the Shanghai unified curriculum, and suggested students watch the online video lessons individually from home, followed by an online synchronous lesson supported by class teachers. This study investigated what primary mathematics teachers learned from addressing these challenges through a case study. By following two purposefully selected teachers over 2 weeks during the transition, multiple data sets including online video lessons, online synchronous lessons, daily reflections, and post-online teacher interviews were collected. A fine-grained analysis of the data from the lens of the documentational approach to didactics found that teachers adaptively used online video lessons as important resources for their online synchronous lessons and virtual Teaching Research Groups as a teachers’ collaboration mechanism supported them to develop online video lessons and address various technological constraints. Finally, implications of this case study for mathematics education globally are discussed.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The Every Student Succeeds Act builds on prior efforts to bridge the gap between research and practice through the imposition of evidence requirements. This article presents findings from a small-scale micro-process study of three districts in one state during their first year of implementing those requirements. Informed by past conceptualizations of the research-practice gap and sociocultural theory, I look closely at how these practitioners made use of the state’s highly elaborated implementation tools for research-based decision-making. I argue that these micro-processes point to possible new dimensions of the research-practice gap—namely, practitioners’ understandings of the purposes of evidence, the degree of confidence evidence should provide, and the commensurability of different forms of evidence

  Abstract
                  <p>According to situated expectancy-value models, motivational variables play an important role in students’ engagement in academic mathematics courses and achievement. However, for academic mathematical learning, only a few studies provide information regarding the fluctuation of task values on different occasions (situation-specificity, state) and the extent to which task values depend on individual characteristics (personal-specificity, trait). Thus, answering these questions provides information about the extent to which adequate situational characteristics, such as relevance interventions, can influence students’ motivation to engage in the learning process. To contribute to this discussion of the situation- and personal-specificity of task values, I surveyed 181 undergraduate students attending an advanced mathematics course. These students reported on their task values and effort three times in four different lessons during a course in linear algebra. I focused on the following three questions: (1) situation-specificity: to what extent do task values fluctuate between situations (and between persons)? (2) predictions of task values: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict task values? (3) predictions of effort: to what extent do personal characteristics and situational perceptions predict effort? These questions were answered by applying linear mixed models. The analysis results indicate that task values fluctuate only slightly in different situations and are strongly predicted by individual characteristics, such as interest in university mathematics, and task values predict effort. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Respondents’ problem-solving behaviors comprise behaviors that represent complicated cognitive processes that are frequently systematically tied to one another. Biometric data, such as visual fixation counts (FCs), which are an important eye-tracking indicator, can be combined with other types of variables that reflect different aspects of problem-solving behavior to quantify variability in problem-solving behavior. To provide comprehensive feedback and accurate diagnosis when using such multimodal data, the present study proposes a multimodal joint cognitive diagnosis model that accounts for latent attributes, latent ability, processing speed, and visual engagement by simultaneously modeling response accuracy (RA), response times, and FCs. We used two simulation studies to test the feasibility of the proposed model. Findings mainly suggest that the parameters of the proposed model can be well recovered and that modeling FCs, in addition to RA and response times, could increase the comprehensiveness of feedback on problem-solving-related cognitive characteristics as well as the accuracy of knowledge structure diagnosis. An empirical example is used to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the proposed model. We discuss the implications of our findings as they relate to research and practice.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Thirty-seven third graders and thirty-two first graders engaged in solving a tangram puzzle in the shape of a fox. They had five minutes to solve the puzzle, and after this time, they received guidance on the particular piece they had difficulties with. Through the lenses of navigating flexible abstraction, reinterpretation, combinations, and borrowing structure to expand upon the existing 2D shape composition and decomposition learning trajectory, we examined ways in which students’ puzzle-solving processes and their challenges related to the fox puzzle’s features. Students’ initial shape placements suggest that parts of the fox puzzle primed the use of particular pieces, which reduced the abstraction of the puzzle. The most challenging part of the puzzle for students was navigating reinterpretation to place the square and two small triangles on the fox’s head in nonstandard orientations. Even though students faced challenges at different steps, they overcame them similarly by trying new combinations and by borrowing structure. Some students did not complete the puzzle even though they used flips and turns (reinterpretation) strategically. The results suggest potential modifications of the current learning trajectory to account for differences between tangram and pattern block puzzles and differences due to tangram puzzles’ features. Because the puzzle’s features played a role in students’ challenges, future work needs to focus on the interaction between students’ puzzle-solving processes and puzzles’ features for a variety of tangram puzzles.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Offering explanations is a central part of teaching mathematics, and understanding those explanations is a vital activity for learners. Given this, it is natural to ask what makes a good mathematical explanation. This question has received surprisingly little attention in the mathematics education literature, perhaps because the field has no agreed method by which explanation quality can be reliably assessed. In this paper, we explore this issue by asking whether mathematicians and undergraduates agree with each other about explanation quality. A corpus of 10 explanations produced by 10 mathematicians was used. Using a comparative judgement method, we analysed 320 paired comparisons from 16 mathematicians and 320 from 32 undergraduate students. We found that both mathematicians and undergraduates were able to reliably assess the quality of a set of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the assessments were largely consistent across the two groups. Implications for theories of mathematical explanation are discussed. We conclude by arguing that comparative judgement is a promising technique for exploring explanation quality.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruption to mathematics teacher education worldwide. This paper is anchored in our learnings from the experiences of teacher educators at four major universities from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they dealt with changes in their programs’ delivery triggered by the pandemic, and raises challenges that remain for the futures of post-pandemic mathematics teacher education. Here, we use the two ethical constructs of responsiveness and responsibility to guide actions in response to a crisis, in order to discuss a range of decisions the participants made to respond to the crisis. Behind their initial response to the emergent conditions, the participants were concerned about maintaining the continuity of their students’ education. Further, we identify remaining challenges for mathematics teacher educators to re-imagine their curriculum, teaching, assessment, and equitable access towards a more relevant, productive, and equitable mathematics teacher education. This study adds to the rapidly increasing literature on the effect of the pandemic on mathematics education in the following three ways: (1) here we take a comprehensive view of the disruptions instigated by the pandemic;, (2) we pay special attention to issues of equity; and (3) we address concerns about possible and desirable post-pandemic futures.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Understanding of the equal sign is associated with early algebraic competence in the elementary grades and equation-solving success in middle school. Thus, it is important to find ways to build foundational understanding of the equal sign as a relational symbol. Past work promoted a conception of the equal sign as meaning “the same as”. However, recent work highlights another dimension of relational understanding—a substitutive conception, which emphasizes the idea that an expression can be substituted for another equivalent one. This work suggests a substitutive conception may support algebra performance above and beyond a sameness conception alone. In this paper, we share a subset of results from an online intervention designed to foster a relational understanding of the equal sign among fourth and fifth graders (n = 146). We compare lessons focused on a sameness conception alone and a dual sameness and substitutive conception to each other, and we compare both to a control condition. The lessons influenced students’ likelihood of producing and endorsing sameness and substitutive definitions of the equal sign. However, the impact of the lessons on students’ approaches to missing value equations was less clear. We discuss possible interpretations, and we argue that further research is needed to explore the roles of sameness and substitutive views of the equal sign in supporting structural approaches to algebraic equation solving.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Informational text—resources whose purpose is to inform—is essential to daily life and fundamental to literacy. Unfortunately, young children typically have limited exposure to informational text. Two 9-week randomized controlled trials with 263 first-grade children from low-income communities examined whether free educational videos and digital games supported children’s ability to use informational text to answer real-world questions. Participants received Internet-enabled tablets and were randomly assigned to condition. Study 1 found significant positive intervention impacts on child outcomes; Study 2 replicated these findings. Combined analyses demonstrated primary impact on children’s ability to identify and use structural and graphical features of informational text. Results are discussed in the context of the scalability of educational media to support informational text learning.
