  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States and broad-access colleges are rapidly scaling corequisite coursework—a model where students concurrently enroll in college-level and developmental coursework—in response to dismal completion rates in traditional “developmental” sequences. At community colleges, evidence suggests that corequisite reforms can dramatically improve students’ completion of required college-level courses, but colleges often implement new programing and sequences with limited information. We analyzed administrative data from Texas community colleges implementing a statewide corequisite mandate. Our results illustrate (a) how colleges structured corequisite courses in response to the statewide mandate and (b) how corequisite coursework characteristics predicted student outcomes. Our results suggest that some corequisite coursework elements—including mixed-ability college-level classes, higher credits for the developmental education (dev-ed) corequisite support course, and using the same instructor across both the college-level and dev-ed course—improve students’ probability of passing college-level math, though these course design elements do not appear to predict long-term outcomes like persistence in college.

  Abstract
                  <p>For a century and a half, the scene of mathematics competitions underwent a remarkable transformation from isolated and geographically scattered events to a full-scale and a full-featured vibrant global ecosystem comprising an impressive variety of competitions, school students, university students, teachers, mentors, scientists, schools, universities, research institutions, journals, websites, civil society organizations, educational authorities, parents, etc. The evolution, the current state, the functioning of this ecosystem as well as its role for the identification and development of talent, its impact on the educational process, and the institutions involved with it, is briefly reflected on. Some relatively new online competitions are presented that cultivate the use of dynamic geometry software systems for a deeper understanding of mathematical facts and phenomena, and for finding approximate numerical solutions to problems that are not part of a typical school curriculum, but often arise from real-life practice.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Disabled students have historically been dehumanized in education, generally, and in research and practice related to school mathematics (K–12), particularly. Typically, they are only offered access to low-rigor school mathematics emphasizing rote procedures and narrow skills, often segregated physically and socially from their nondisabled peers. Educators are crucial to the humanization of disabled students via anti-ableist and antiracist work toward systemic transformation. The purpose of this review is to take stock of the current knowledge base of educator and disability research concerning school mathematics, recommending directions for humanizing future research and practice. Through a humanizing mathematics education lens, we analyze 61 articles involving educators, disabilities, and school mathematics published during the decade between 2007 and 2016. Results of our analysis point to not only the continued perpetuation of dehumanizing approaches and positioning but also substantial shifts toward humanization in mathematics education for disabled students. Over half of the studies reflected humanizing shifts. Yet, overwhelmingly, studies continue to avoid meaningful intersectional considerations of race and disability.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Research in sociology demonstrates the way social connections shape access to information about job opportunities. In education, we understand less about how social networks impact the job process for marginalized teachers and teachers in nontraditional labor markets. This study examines how teachers in New Orleans and Detroit, cities with high concentrations of charter schools, use their networks to search for jobs, and how their experiences vary by race and gender. We find that in choice-rich environments, there was an extensive reliance on social networks in the hiring process, and teachers had different access to key social networks that can help to land jobs. Hiring decisions and unequal access to job opportunities among teacher candidates, in part due to the reliance on networks, created conditions where teachers who cultivated stronger networks, or with access to the “right” networks, had greater opportunity, with implications for racial and gender equity and diversity.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Gentrification is happening in cities all across the United States. Consequently, some Black communities that were intentionally segregated and under-resourced are experiencing capital investments and demographic changes. These gentrification-induced racial and socioeconomic shifts impact many local institutions, namely school districts. Given this, there is an emerging body of research on schools and gentrification. However, less research has examined the actions of school districts as institutional actors in gentrification. This study examines how two school districts’ actions mediate school gentrification. Using a theorization of gentrification as a process of racial capitalism, we draw on interviews with 26 principals across both districts. Our findings suggest that districts’ actions influence school gentrification by mediating the movement of Black and other youth of color to various schools through cycles of differential investments across the districts. We conclude with implications for future research.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Many researchers have considered recent and intergenerational immigrant children’s perspectives on immigration policies. Fewer have investigated nonimmigrant children’s views despite children’s sociopolitical identities forming long before they can vote. Drawing from data generated in spring 2017, the author illustrates how young children at an urban, midwestern school argued against the Republican administration’s (anti-)immigration policies. Framed as an ethnographic case study, the author focuses on how third graders enacted justice-oriented identities as they wrote to congressional representatives about contemporary immigration policies. By attuning to how children embedded multiple institutional and political contexts in their written rationale, the author explicates the tensions and possibilities for nonimmigrant children in writing policies and possibilities for tomorrow. Ultimately, the author argues adults must intentionally sustain children’s civic participation in ways beyond the niceties that plague early years classrooms.

  Abstract
                  <p>Children’s multiplicative thinking as the recognition of equal group structures and the enumeration of the composite units was the subject of this research. In this paper, we provide an overview of the Multiplication and Division Investigations project. The results were obtained from a small sample of Australian children (n = 21) in their first year of school (mean age 5 years 6 months) who participated in a teaching experiment of five lessons taught by their classroom teacher. The tasks introduced children to the “equal groups” aspect of multiplication. A theoretical framework of constructivist learning, together with research literature underpinning early multiplicative thinking, tasks, and children’s thinking, was used to design the research. Our findings indicate that young children could imagine equal group structures and, in doing so, recognise and enumerate composite units. As the children came to these tasks without any prior formal instruction, it seemed that they had intuitive understandings of equal group structures based on their life experiences. We argue that the implications for teaching include creating learning provocations that elicit children’s early ideas of multiplication, visualisation, and abstraction. The research has also shown the importance of observing children, listening to their explanations of their thinking, and using insights provided by their drawings.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Most institutions of higher learning offer undergraduate mathematics tutoring, yet little is known regarding the work tutors do or the knowledge needed to enact that work. We explore the mathematical knowledge needed for the work of undergraduate peer drop-in mathematics tutoring. The data consists of transcripts from eight stimulated recall interviews, two each from four tutors, during which each tutor reflected on six of their recorded tutor sessions per interview. We first summarize and synthesize different conceptualizations of mathematical knowledge for teaching, with particular attention to definitions of knowledge types and their use in teaching. We examine the applicability of conceptualizations of the mathematical knowledge of teaching to tutoring to answer the following research question: How do frameworks for mathematical knowledge for teaching appear in the undergraduate peer drop-in tutoring context? Our findings indicate aspects of mathematical knowledge for teaching frameworks apply to the tutoring context; however, it is not a perfect match. In particular, aspects of mathematical knowledge for teaching which are used in planning tasks are not relevant for the work of drop-in tutors. By understanding the knowledge required for tutoring, future research can explore how this knowledge develops. This understanding may ultimately lead to improved tutor training which focuses on both mathematical knowledge, different from content knowledge gained in the math classroom, and pedagogical knowledge specific to mathematics tutoring.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study presents an analysis of the incommensurability about the representations or models elaborated by children from an Indigenous community within three areas or cultural domains, namely, the ethnic, daily (domestic), and school domains and their implications in relation to science education. The children belong to an Indigenous Nahuatl community which is located in the Sierra Norte of Puebla, México. The analysis is based on the children’s model constructions concerning two scientific topics: (1) the mixture of colours and (2) the Earth’s shape and day-night cycle. Both topics belong to the school program. The children’s models are the result of previous investigations that are analysed within this work from an epistemological approach where non-translatability criteria are used to determine the incommensurability of the corresponding models to the different cultural areas. The results show that the models in each area are effectively incommensurable and are therefore coexistent without any integration or displacement process or the presence of conflict among the three cultural areas on a daily life basis. A brief discussion is showed on the implications of results on the difficulties of crossing border processes and the potential conceptual conflicts in young students.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Noticing is a skill that is not overtly observable yet is consequential to effective mathematics instruction. Researchers have found that prospective and practicing teachers can learn to notice, but little focus has been given to those who teach teachers to notice. The purpose of the study was to characterize mathematics teacher educators’ noticing and their ability to interpret students’ thinking and connect interpretations to evidence. Participants in the study included 16 mathematics teacher educators who took part in a course designed to support noticing. Results indicate the mathematics teacher educators noticed at varying degrees and improved their noticing and incidence of connections between interpretations and evidence. Findings indicated that 19% of participants had no shift in their noticing because they were at the highest level of noticing to begin with (Robust with Strong Evidence), which was considered advanced noticing. Twenty-five percent of the participants did not shift in their noticing at all and remained at Limited, which is considered an intermediate level of noticing. The remaining 56% of the participants improved their noticing. The results of the study reveal that at the end of the course a majority of the participants were able to connect interpretations with evidence. These findings are important because they describe mathematics teacher educators’ interpretations and evidence as they notice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this study, we sought to identify how feedback about classroom observations affected novice university mathematics instructors’ (UMIs) teaching practices. Specifically, we examined how a Red–Yellow–Green feedback system (RYG feedback) affected graduate student instructor (GSI) scores on an observation protocol (GSIOP). The protocol was developed specifically for this population, and both the GSIOP and RYG feedback were used within a peer mentoring program for GSIs, wherein novice GSIs were mentored by more experienced GSIs. Mentors observed novices’ classrooms using the GSIOP and provided RYG feedback as part of observation–feedback cycles. We analyzed 100 sets of scores, each collected over the course of a semester containing on average three observation–feedback cycles. Analyzing the semester-long datasets longitudinally provided insight into what types of feedback informed and influenced observed teaching. After qualitatively coding the feedback provided to the GSIs by their mentors along multiple dimensions, we found certain forms of feedback were more influential for observable changes in GSIs’ teaching. For example, pedagogical feedback that included contextualization (context and focal events) demonstrated a more positive change in GSIOP score than feedback that lacked contextualization. Our results suggest that contextual formative feedback has a positive change to student-focused and teacher-focused observations.

  Abstract
                    <p>The effective teaching and learning of mathematics through mathematical modeling and connecting mathematics to the real world has gained rapid growth at various educational levels all over the world. The growth in modeling practices in the United States of America (US) and the international community is the result of the development and implementation of new mathematics standards and curricula across the world. In this article, we report on the development and use of a quantitative instrument aimed at assessing teachers of mathematics attitudes toward mathematical modeling practices. Based on the responses of 310 practicing teachers of mathematics from the US, the mathematical modeling attitude scale was evaluated using item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and other psychometric properties. The scale isolated four dimensions: constructivism, understanding, relevance and real-life, and motivation and interest. These 4 factors accounted for 59% of the variation in the 28-item measure. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the overall scale was .96, and that for the subscales was .93 for constructivism, .81 for understanding, .88 for relevance and real-life, and .89 for motivation and interest. The findings suggest a psychometrically useable, reliable, and valid scale for studying teacher’s attitudes toward mathematical modeling. We discuss the instrument’s merit for research and teaching, and implications for teacher education, professional development, and future research.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we report an enquiry into elementary preservice teachers’ learning, as they engage in doing mathematics for themselves. As a group of researchers working in elementary Initial Teacher Education in English universities, we co-planned and taught sessions on growing pattern generalisation. Following the sessions, interviews of fifteen preservice teachers at two universities focused on their expressed awareness of their approach to the mathematical activity. Preservice teachers’ prospective planning and post-teaching evaluations of similar activities in their classrooms were also examined. We draw on aspects of enactivism and the notion of reflective “spection” in the context of teacher learning, tracing threads between preservice teachers’ retro-spection of learning and pro-spection of teaching. Our analysis indicates that increasing sensitivity to their own embodied processes of generalisation offers opportunities for novice teachers to respond deliberately, rather than to react impulsively, to different pedagogical possibilities. The paper contributes a new dimension to the discussion about the focus of novice elementary school teachers’ retrospective reflection by examining how deliberate retrospective analysis of doing mathematics, and not only of teaching actions, can develop awarenesses that underlie the growth of expertise in mathematics teaching. We argue that engaging preservice teachers in mathematics to support deliberate retrospective analysis of their mathematics learning and prospective consideration of the implications for teaching can enable more critical pedagogical choices.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Whether faculty research affects college student learning has long been the subject of debate. Previous studies use subjective measures of student learning; focus on correlation rather than causation; and typically focus on one college, thus lacking generalizability. Using unique, large-scale survey and assessment data that we collected from nationally representative samples of STEM undergraduates in China, India, and Russia, as well as a causal identification strategy that accounts for differential sorting of students to faculty, we present generalizable estimates of the effect of faculty research on objective, standardized measures of student learning. Results show that faculty research has a negative effect on student learning, suggesting direct trade-offs between the university’s dual mission of producing research and learning.
