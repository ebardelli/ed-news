          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Legislative professionalism is central to the politico-institutional context of postsecondary policy adoption in state governments. The core argument in existing research is that as legislative professionalism increases, structural capacity for decision-making increases. Evidence for this argument is mixed, exclusively quantitative, and assumes a bureaucratic logic. The goal of this study is to deepen understanding of legislative professionalism by examining how policy stakeholders perceive the postsecondary policy environment in a “citizen legislature.” The study draws on 26 in-depth interviews with higher education stakeholders in Nevada. The findings contribute empirically to the literature by demonstrating that legislative professionalism can be understood in terms of the meanings assigned distinctive legislative environments. The results also make a conceptual contribution to this literature by showing how loose coupling in interorganizational relations and bounded rationality shape the policy environment—in ways that yield benefits for some institutions and disadvantages for others.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Tourism is one of the important factors that can affect the environmental and economic situation of any economy. This study investigates the relationship between tourist arrivals and CO2 emission in the top 20 tourist destinations using data from quarterly observations from 1995 to 2018. A unique technique via quantile-on-quantile regression and Granger causality in quantiles was used. In particular, how the quantiles of tourist arrivals impact quantiles of CO2 emission was analyzed. The empirical results suggest a combination of both positive and negative effects of tourist arrivals and CO2 emission in most tourist destinations. Predominantly, at both high and low tails, in the USA, Spain, Hong Kong, and Austria, tourist arrival has a positive effect on CO2 emission, whereas in the case of Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and Malaysia, the association was negative. On the other hand, China, Greece, Russia, Japan, Italy, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey have both positive and negative effects of tourism on CO2 emissions at low and high tails. Tourism can be an important factor while formulating policy for environmental and climate aspects.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The prediction of dangerous and/or violent behavior is particularly important to the conduct of the U.S. criminal justice system when it makes decisions about restrictions of personal freedom, such as preventive detention, forensic commitment, parole, and in some states such as Texas, when to permit an execution to proceed of an individual found guilty of a capital crime. This article discusses the prediction of dangerous behavior both through clinical judgment and actuarial assessment. The general conclusion drawn is that for both clinical and actuarial prediction of dangerous behavior, we are far from a level of accuracy that could justify routine use. To support this later negative assessment, two topic areas are emphasized: (1) the MacArthur Study of Mental Disorder and Violence, including the actuarial instrument developed as part of this project (the Classification of Violence Risk), along with all the data collected that helped develop the instrument; and (2) the U.S. Supreme Court case of Barefoot v. Estelle (1983) and the American Psychiatric Association “friend of the court” brief on the (in)accuracy of clinical prediction for the commission of future violence. Although now three decades old, Barefoot v. Estelle is still the controlling Supreme Court opinion regarding the prediction of future dangerous behavior and the imposition of the death penalty in states, such as Texas; for example, see Coble v. Texas (2011) and the Supreme Court denial of certiorari in that case.

          Abstract
                  <p>In prior work, we fit the mixture Rasch model to item responses from a fractions survey administered to a nationwide sample of middle grades mathematics teachers in the United States. The mixture Rasch model located teachers on a continuous, unidimensional scale and fit best with 3 latent classes. We used item response data to generate initial interpretations of the reasoning characteristic of each latent class. Our results suggested increasing facility reasoning about fraction arithmetic from one class to the next. The present study contributes two further arguments for the validity of our initial interpretations. First, we administered the same survey to a new sample of future middle grades mathematics teachers before and after 20 weeks of instruction on multiplication, division, and fractions, and we found that from pretest to posttest future teachers transitioned from one latent class to another in ways consistent with increased proficiency in fraction arithmetic. Second, we interviewed 8 of the future teachers before and after the instruction and found that future teachers’ reasoning during interviews was largely consistent with our original interpretation of the 3 latent classes. These results provide further support for our original interpretation of the mixture Rasch analysis, demonstrate the utility of our approach for capturing growth and change in future teachers’ reasoning during teacher education coursework, and contribute innovative applications of psychometric models for surveying teachers’ reasoning at scale.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the performances of university students’ using dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra in argumentations and proving processes. A task related to the limit involving sin
                    
                    \(x\)
                    
                  /x was designed and 18 university students worked on the task during the collaborative learning, scientific debate, and self-reflection stages. Students’ argumentations and proofs were analyzed based on Toulmin’s model and Habermas’ construct of rationality. The results revealed that the rationality components can be used to explain the implicit features of warrant in Toulmin’s model. It was found that the semiotic mediation opportunities offered by GeoGebra and the teamwork and debate stages in the teaching method enabled the students to create geometrically the ranking relation between the value of an angle and the sine and tangent values of this angle. They also facilitated using the various kinds of representation and enhanced the transformations within and/or between the representations. GeoGebra tools as instruments of semiotic mediation helped the students to construct productive arguments, validate them, be productive by providing backing and rebuttal to the collective arguments put forward during the teamwork stage, and reach consensus thanks to scientific debate.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This brief describes how several commonly used per-pupil funding measures derived from federal data include passthrough funding in the numerator but exclude students attached to this funding from the denominator, artificially inflating per-pupil ratios. Three forms of passthrough funding for students not educated by the school district where they reside are included in district-level funding totals: payments to private schools (V91), payments to charter schools (V92), and payments to other school systems (Q11). We illustrate this error in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and use data from all 46 impacted states to show how racial and economic funding gaps are understated as a result.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Educator mental health sits at the intersection of multiple pressing educational issues. We are among the first to provide estimates of school system employee (SSE) stress, anxiety, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most participants reported clinically meaningful anxiety and depressive symptoms (77.96% and 53.65%, respectively). Being in the lowest strata of family income was associated with higher stress, a greater likelihood of clinically significant depressive symptoms, and reduced intentions to continue in the same job, portending the current staffing shortages affecting schools. Supporting SSE mental health should become a policy priority.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>We used a situated approach to examine the aftermath of citations for racial disparities in special education and discipline. The study was conducted in one suburban school district and examined staff’s interpretations and responses to multiple disproportionality citations. We found that historical, spatial, and sociocultural contexts mediated stakeholders’ interpretations and reactions to citations and the consequences of their responses. Our findings demonstrate how a history of race relations in the district and the community as well as spatial opportunity structures shaped disability and discipline racial disparities; the consequences of a damaged imagery for multiply marginalized youth and their families in explanations of disproportionality citations; and the shortcomings of the district’s symbolic and predominately color-evasive responses as a consequence of ambiguous federal and state policy mandates.

          Abstract
      
                  <p>The teaching of natural sciences and technology in primary schools presents an opportunity to use innovative approaches to teach STEM-based activities. The subject presents opportunities for learners to experience STEM-based instructional approaches in their early school years; therefore, it is essential that preservice primary school teachers are adequately prepared for the task. This study explored the perceptions of preservice teachers of STEM-based teaching in natural sciences and technology classrooms. Using a qualitative research approach and a single case study of a science and technology teaching methods course at a South African university, five participants were purposively selected from a group of 42 preservice teachers who had participated in a project to develop lesson plans and reflect on how to teach STEM. The data collected were analysed using thematic content analysis techniques. The findings indicate that the preservice teachers used natural sciences as an entry point to teach STEM and underestimated the technology component. The preservice teachers had the perception that STEM is taught through activity-based strategies while incorporating assessment for learning. Although they identified activities that could be used to teach STEM, they did not link the activities with developing specific skills in the lesson plans. The study recommends that preservice teachers be taught to link STEM activities with the development of specific STEM skills.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article is concerned with the statistical detection of copying on multiple-choice exams. As an alternative to existing permutation- and model-based copy-detection approaches, a simple randomization p-value (RP) test is proposed. The RP test, which is based on an intuitive match-score statistic, makes no assumptions about the distribution of examinees’ answer vectors and hence is broadly applicable. Especially important in this copy-detection setting, the RP test is shown to be exact in that its size is guaranteed to be no larger than a nominal α value. Additionally, simulation results suggest that the RP test is typically more powerful for copy detection than the existing approximate tests. The development of the RP test is based on the idea that the copy-detection problem can be recast as a causal inference and missing data problem. In particular, the observed data are viewed as a subset of a larger collection of potential values, or counterfactuals, and the null hypothesis of “no copying” is viewed as a “no causal effect” hypothesis and formally expressed in terms of constraints on potential variables.

      </h3>
      <p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This article examines the complex process of teachers’ care for students in contexts of inclusive refugee education in Jordan, where Syrian refugees and Jordanian students study together. I illustrate that while teachers’ caring practices represent efforts to support refugee students, they are limited by teachers’ inability to see the social, structural, and systemic power dynamics that restrict Syrian refugees, reifying unequal relations of power between refugees and nationals. National teachers are embedded in the social fabric of the societies in which they live and not impervious to the discriminatory attitudes towards refugees, thereby limiting the extent of their care. This article illuminates the complexity of inclusive refugee education and concludes with implications for teacher education and professional development.

          Abstract
                  <p>In 2019, the Ontario Ministry of Education announced a mandatory mathematics examination for all newly licensed teachers in the province. The following winter, after a brief pilot and a few months during COVID of testing, a court case declared the mathematics examination unconstitutional, and it has been paused since January 2021. This paper discusses the research-based evidence that has led to support from a mathematics standpoint for such an examination, as well as the court case that has changed the ability of the province to provide licensing guidelines. We provide our research conclusions on why such an examination might be needed and cautions for considering the reasons that led to the court overturning the proficiency test.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>In this paper, we investigate how teacher-student interactions taking place while using a technological resource inform teaching practices and how these interactions subsequently influence the integration of the resource into teaching. Using the documentational approach and the theory of instrumental orchestration as a framework, we look at this issue from a documentational genesis perspective. In our study, we examine the documentational work of a primary teacher who is using the technological resource GeoGebra to introduce the properties of parallelograms to grade 6 primary students (age 11–12). Our research reveals the importance of the adjustments the teacher makes to the lesson plan during in-class implementation. New practices begin to take shape, as shown through the emergence of two types of instrumental orchestrations, translating into more precise guidance of the students’ work and stemming from the interactions between the students and the teacher. Such interactions then become a resource for the teacher who is developing in-class practices.</p>

Leveraging 17 years of statewide student-level records from Tennessee, the authors examine the relationship between working while enrolled and degree completion, time to degree, credit accumulation, and grade point average. The authors aim to increase understanding of how the timing and intensity of work relate to student outcomes and to explore how these relationships differ by college sector, industry of employment, and student characteristics. The authors find consistent negative associations between work and academic success, especially at higher levels of work intensity. Working students attempt and earn fewer credits and are 4 to 7 percentage points less likely to complete college. Among completers, working students take longer to graduate, even though they earn similar grade point averages and complete their attempted credits at similar rates to nonworking students.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Persistent social inequities in the United States demand attention to culturally responsive (CR) teaching, which requires a specific disposition toward students and teaching. Using survey data of secondary teachers (N = 417) in seven urban districts across the country engaging in equity-oriented professional learning (PL) initiatives, we examine the relationship between teachers’ beliefs about, self-efficacy for, and engagement in PL around CR teaching and their self-reported CR teaching practices. We find correlational evidence that teacher-reported self-efficacy with CR teaching and engagement in PL focused on CR teaching are associated with higher self-reported frequency of CR teaching. We also find that teachers who have beliefs aligned with CR teaching have a stronger relationship between their CR teaching self-efficacy and self-reported CR teaching practices. Finally, we find evidence that changes in CR teaching self-efficacy are associated with changes in self-reported CR teaching—suggesting that CR teaching self-efficacy may drive changes in CR teaching.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we turn to the notion of networking theories with the aim of contrasting two theoretical mathematics education perspectives inspired by Vygotsky’s work, namely, the Theory of Objectification and the Documentational Approach to Didactics. We are interested in comparing/contrasting these theories in accordance with the following three main questions: (a) the role that the theories ascribe to language and resources; (b) the conceptions that the theories bring forward concerning the teacher, and (c) the understandings they offer of the mathematics classroom. In the first part of the paper, some basic concepts of each perspective are presented. The second part includes some episodes from a lesson on the teaching and learning of algebra in a Grade 1 class (6–7-year-old students). The episodes serve as background to carry out, in the third part of the paper, a dialogue between proponents of the theoretical perspectives around the identified main questions. The dialogue shows some theoretical complementarities and differences and reveals, in particular, different conceptions of the teacher and the limits and possibilities that language affords in teaching–learning mathematics.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a common measure used to gauge social, cultural, and financial capital in scientific literature. Over time, SES research has produced an extremely wide and inconsistently used variety of SES variables and components. This study will review research that estimates SES and will examine common components and trends from the inception of its measurement to present data. A systematic review protocol was used to gather literature related to SES, and a historical analysis was conducted to examine the SES variables and their components that were most commonly used in the literature. Results displayed varying trends by decade, with earlier SES measures including components on social capital and more recent measures incorporating aspects of cultural and economic capital. Subjective perspectives of social class became more common toward the turn of the century, and few measures included components from more asset-based frameworks. The Big 3 measures (parental education, parental occupation, and income) have been common measures across time.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>We study a decade of achievement gaps for fifth-, eighth-, and 10th-grade students in Norway using administrative population data. Norway is a wealthy and egalitarian country with a homogeneous educational system, yet achievement gaps between students at the 90th and 10th percentiles of parental income and between students whose parents have at least a master and at most a high school degree are found to be large (0.55–0.93 and 0.70–0.99 SD), equivalent to about 2 to 2.5 years of schooling, and increasing by grade level. Achievement gaps by parental income, but not by parental education, increased over the time period, underscoring the different ways these two socioeconomic status components relate to achievement and the potential for policy to alter gaps.
