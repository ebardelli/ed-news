  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 62-63, December 2021/January 2022. <br>As education leaders are making plans for how to use American Rescue Plan funds, Maria Ferguson considers what lessons they might learn from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009. Like the tranches of funding being provided to schools as COVID relief, the ARRA funds were meant to help schools grapple with a national crisis, in that case the Great Recession. To receive funds, states had to commit to certain reforms that aligned with President Barack Obama’s education agenda. However, the funds were not enough to enable state, district, and school leaders to accomplish the desired goals, and the political heat generated by the Common Core State Standards didn’t help. Today’s funds come with more flexibility than in the ARRA era, but, once again, money may not be enough to accomplish what’s needed.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 60-61, December 2021/January 2022. <br>School board meetings have become increasingly contentious in recent months, but, as Josh Starr explains, the tactics activists are using are not new. During his career as a district leader, he saw parents and other members of the public approach school boards with constant demands that their particular concerns receive attention. When these issues are on the fringe or outside the board’s purview, yet activists engage in increasingly outrageous behavior, leaders develop the habit of tuning out public voices, which serves no one.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 49-53, December 2021/January 2022. <br>Out-of-school programs can offer personalized and meaningful learning experiences that deepen students’ knowledge and cater to their passions and interests, but it has been a painful reality that many such programs have been available only to students and families with privilege and resources. Karen Hammerness, Anna MacPherson, Preeti Gupta, Tramia Jackson, and Rachel Chaffee describe how the Science Research Mentoring Consortium in New York City gives students from underserved communities opportunities to engage in STEM activities alongside researchers at sites throughout the city. Students with a strong interest in and aptitude for science take classes after school or on weekends and conduct their own research with the support of mentors. The authors share the principles that undergird the program and that can be applied to similar mentoring partnership programs in other disciplines.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 54-57, December 2021/January 2022. <br>The COVID-19 pandemic led states and districts to take a break from grading students and pause standardized testing. As part of an ongoing series of articles on how schools might reconceptualize their work, William Penuel considers what kinds of assessment practices should be carried forward, as schools attempt to become more equitable. He suggests that schools look to work students create as evidence of learning, that they ensure their assessment practices recognize students’ various cultures, and that they use student work to make connections with families and community members.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 44-48, December 2021/January 2022. <br>Student-directed projects are a promising approach to supporting powerful learning, yet uncertainty about how to assess these projects presents a barrier to widespread incorporation in K-12 classrooms. Drawing on interviews with computer science teachers and an interdisciplinary literature review, Karen Brennan, Sarah Blum-Smith, and Paulina Haduong offer four principles to guide assessment of student-directed projects: recognizing the individuality of the learner, illuminating process, engaging multiple perspectives, and cultivating capacity for personal judgment. They describe the research behind these principles and provide and example of what they look like in practice.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 31-36, December 2021/January 2022. <br>Sky Marietta, co-author of Rural Education in America: What Works for Our Students, Teachers, and Communities, talks with Kappan about her experiences as a rural student, teacher, and scholar. She describes some of the misconceptions about rural schools and communities and shares some of the assets of living and going to school in a rural environment. As an advocate for a more rural-centered approach to education improvement, she urges researchers, funders, policy makers to learn more about these communities and partner with them to develop leaders within the community.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 4, Page 37-43, December 2021/January 2022. <br>Indirect routes to strengthening research-practice connections, through intermediaries or knowledge brokers, have received little emphasis in discussions of education research and practice. Joel Malin compares direct and indirect approaches to making these connections and considers how indirect actors are situated in the education system and what roles and functions they perform. He describes some of the well-known intermediaries, assesses the effects of their efforts, and offers ideas for moving forward.

Michigan State University researchers surveyed and interviewed rural superintendents in Michigan to learn more about their situations. Superintendents identified teacher recruitment and retention, the need for mental health services, limited broadband access, and insufficient funding as their most pressing challenges. The researchers note that addressing these challenges will require state leaders to pay specific attention to rural needs and develop rural-conscious education policies.

However, students with potential in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) face specific obstacles to having their talents fully realized in rural schools. Joni Lakin, Tamra Stambaugh, Lori Ihrig, Duhita Mahatmya, and Susan G. Assouline describe the STEM Excellence and Leadership project from the University of Iowa, which seeks to equip rural teachers in grades 5-8 with the skills and knowledge to recognize and grow STEM talent in rural areas. Examples of success and lessons learned are shared.

Given the time and energy they must invest to successfully attract, recruit, and hire a new teacher, there is a significant need to adopt strategies that will help to retain those new teachers. Rural administrators can support new teachers so that they stay — and thrive — in rural districts by connecting teachers with the community, supporting place-based practices in the classroom, and helping new teachers build relationships both in and out of school.

Teresa Preston explains how the story of the community’s fight to keep this school open and under local control is illustrative of the dilemmas surrounding rural schools that have been covered in Kappan for a century. Articles have grappled with whether schools should focus on encouraging students to stay in rural communities, how to ensure that schools are large enough to provide adequate programs but small enough to reflect the immediate community, and what role parent and community preferences should play in improvement plans for rural schools.

Programs that attempt to fill gaps by promoting teaching among current high school students are helpful but cannot fill vacancies as quickly as is needed. Alan Mather of Golden Apple describes how their Accelerators program has begun inviting career changers and current college seniors who aren’t on an education track into their 15-month residency and licensure program. The program attracts professionals who are interested in teaching but lack the time or money for traditional preparation programs and puts them on a quicker path to teaching jobs in schools with high needs.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The public narrative surrounding efforts to improve low-performing K–12 schools in the United States has been notably gloomy. But what is known empirically about whether school improvement works, which policies are most effective, which contexts respond best to intervention, and how long it takes? We meta-analyze 141 estimates from 67 studies of post–No Child Left Behind Act turnaround policies. On average, policies had moderate positive effects on math and no effect on English Language Arts achievement on high-stakes exams. We find positive impacts on low-stakes exams and no evidence of harm on nontest outcomes. Extended learning time and teacher replacements predict greater effects. Contexts serving majority-Latina/o populations saw the largest improvements. We cannot rule out publication bias entirely but find no differences between peer-reviewed versus nonpeer-reviewed estimates.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Youth social movements for racial justice, especially against police violence, are on the rise. And this broader policy landscape is reflective of how youth are addressing racism in policing in their local context. Therefore, by drawing upon scholarship related to Black Radicalism, activism, and social movements, this study examines how youth of color activists are fighting against the overpolicing of their schools and communities in two specific contexts: Wake County, North Carolina and Chicago, Illinois. This study demonstrates how context shapes youth of color social movement building, that youth are strategic in how they employ activism, and ultimately adults can either impede or help advance youth’s demands for justice.

I share what I learned from students and how the power harnessed by the input of authentic student voice is now driving instructional change throughout the building and the district. I conclude with recommendations for other practitioners on ways they may begin to include students in school improvement efforts as co-leaders, co-researchers, and co-policy actors.
