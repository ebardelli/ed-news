  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Regression discontinuity is popular in finding treatment/policy effects when the treatment is determined by a continuous variable crossing a cutoff. Typically, a local linear regression (LLR) estimator is used to find the effects. For binary response, however, LLR is not suitable in extrapolating the treatment, as in doubling/tripling the treatment dose/intensity. The reason is that doubling/tripling the LLR estimate can give a number out of the bound [math], despite that the effect should be a change in probability. We propose local maximum likelihood estimators which overcome these shortcomings, while giving almost the same estimates as the LLR estimator does for the original treatment. A simulation study and an empirical analysis for effects of an income subsidy program on religion demonstrate these points.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Harnessing a cluster randomized controlled trial, we estimated the impact on students’ advanced placement (AP) examination performance of a project-based learning (PBL) approach to AP compared with a lecture-based AP approach. Through PBL, teachers primarily play a facilitator role, while students work on complex tasks organized around central questions leading to a final product. We estimated positive and significant treatment effects on AP exam performance for the overall sample, within both AP courses studied, and within low- and high-income student groups. Results support teacher-driven adoption of the PBL AP approach within both courses studied, among districts with open-enrollment AP policies and supportive of PBL, for students from low- and high-income households.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>In mathematics education research, proofs are often conceptualized as sequences of mathematical assertions. We argue that this ignores proofs that contain instructions to perform mathematical actions, often in the form of imperatives, which are common both in mathematical practice and in undergraduate mathematics textbooks. We consider in detail a specific type of proof which we call a recipe proof, which is comprised of sequence of instructions that direct the reader to produce mathematical objects with desirable properties. We present a model of what it means to understand a recipe proof and use this model in conjunction with process-object theories from mathematics education research, to explain why recipe proofs are inherently difficult for students to understand.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Undergraduate calculus instruction is a contributor to racialized and gendered trends of STEM persistence and disidentification with mathematics. However, the nature of instruction that promotes equitable learning opportunities for disrupting such negative outcomes and experiences among historically marginalized populations is underexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents an analysis of 34 undergraduate Black and Latina/o students’ perceptions of discouraging events and alternatives for supportive practices in calculus instruction to build theory of equitable practices. Our findings show how supportive-for-all practices – instructional practices supportive for all students (e.g., creating space for questions and mistakes, extending out-of-class support) – were perceived as necessary yet insufficient to cultivate equitable opportunities for classroom participation and access to content. Black and Latina/o participants’ perceptions of instruction addressed how, without challenging broader influences of racism and patriarchy (e.g., stereotypes of mathematical ability), historically marginalized students have limited access to learning opportunities afforded by supportive-for-all practices. The present study, therefore, demonstrates how equitable calculus instruction requires race- and gender-conscious enactment of supportive practices, which challenges colorblind and gender-neutral assumptions of uniformity in students’ experiences of instruction that leave structural forms of exclusion unchecked. We conclude with implications for practice and research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As attention grows towards the disparities and underrepresentation of minoritized groups within undergraduate STEM education, there is a need for understanding how university calculus program stakeholders perceive the issue of increasing diversity. Calculus is a subject crucial to many STEM disciplines, and thus can play an outsized role in facilitating necessary change across STEM fields. We present a research-driven framework from a thematic analysis of interviews and focus groups with calculus program stakeholders (students, faculty, staff, and administrators) at two universities in the United States. The framework juxtaposes various stakeholders’ motivations for diversifying STEM fields along critical and dominant axes with four primary recipients that benefit from diversifying STEM. This framework prompts critical analysis of increasing access and achievement within the current system while also attending to the need to fundamentally change mathematical structures to bolster individual identities and increase the power of marginalized individuals in STEM disciplines.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aims to address the teaching of integrals in multivariable calculus concerning the role taken by geometry, specifically, geometrical content dealing with boundaries in integrals that appear as curves and surfaces in R2 and R3. Adopting the framework of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, we approached the problem by performing a praxeological analysis of typical tasks in a multivariable calculus course to describe the geometry involved, and to support the transition from textbook knowledge where geometry seems to be hidden. Our analysis reveals a collection of geometrical praxeologies that are used in the tasks but are not explicitly taught. Interviews with students show that we cannot consider that students are equipped with these praxeologies prior to taking the course on multivariable calculus.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>We share school leaders’ perspectives on Zoom videos concerning the needs of immigrant and refugee families in Title I schools. In these videos, participants crafted and shared personal narratives about their leadership experiences during the COVID-19 era of education. Rooted in participatory design research methods, the process of designing these videos were both a research project and an intervention to assist families and school leaders to better understand each other. We present a close analysis of administrators’ perspectives and describe how our codesigned video methodology enabled participants to coconstruct new meanings of school-community relationships during the pandemic through a radical care framework. We conceptualize these reimaginings as aperturas—cracks in the dominant family engagement paradigm that allow us to collectively work towards transformative ends which we term community-centered school leadership. We conclude the article with recommendations for how both school leadership and research can approach and reimagine family engagement postpandemic.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The speed–accuracy trade-off (SAT) suggests that time constraints reduce response accuracy. Its relevance in observational settings—where response time (RT) may not be constrained but respondent speed may still vary—is unclear. Using 29 data sets containing data from cognitive tasks, we use a flexible method for identification of the SAT (which we test in extensive simulation studies) to probe whether the SAT holds. We find inconsistent relationships between time and accuracy; marginal increases in time use for an individual do not necessarily predict increases in accuracy. Additionally, the speed–accuracy relationship may depend on the underlying difficulty of the interaction. We also consider the analysis of items and individuals; of particular interest is the observation that respondents who exhibit more within-person variation in response speed are typically of lower ability. We further find that RT is typically a weak predictor of response accuracy. Our findings document a range of empirical phenomena that should inform future modeling of RTs collected in observational settings.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>It is expected that all students in the United States learn to read English well. This task is more complex for emergent bilinguals (EBs), the majority of whom speak Spanish, who are simultaneously developing their English language proficiency. Although several syntheses have documented the positive effects of shared book reading (SBR) in school settings on students’ language growth, the majority of these have either not included EBs or addressed their participants’ language learner status. In this review, we sought to identify all peer-reviewed experimental study reports examining the effects of SBR on language-related outcomes for Spanish-speaking EBs. We identified 17 relevant studies, 11 of which we determined met What Works Clearinghouse™ (WWC) quality standards with or without reservations. Of these, 10 also demonstrated statistically significant effects on at least one language-related outcome. Included studies primarily examined vocabulary outcomes, with mostly medium to large effect sizes found on researcher-designed (RD) measures. We reported on components found across different SBR interventions, and made recommendations for practice and future research.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The authors present a systematic review of elementary school universal school-based (USB) social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions from 2008 through 2020 for two groups of minoritized students in education research and practice: students with disabilities and/or minoritized racial identities. Completed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards, in this review the authors identified 269 studies for inclusion, which reflected 107 USB SEL interventions. Eleven studies explicitly excluded students with disabilities. Studies varied widely in how disability and racial identity were categorized within and across studies and provided limited evidence of effectiveness through the use of subgroup analyses to support meaningful assessment of how students with disabilities and racially minoritized elementary school age students are benefiting from USB SEL interventions. The authors discuss the limitations of findings, education research best practices, and the minimum reporting standards necessary to ensure ability and racially minoritized youth representation in future USB SEL research.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we consider implications of the current world-wide inclusion of computational thinking in relation to children’s development of algebraic thinking. Little is known about how newly developed visual programming environments such as Scratch could enhance early algebra learning. The study is based on examples of programming activities used by mathematics teachers in Sweden, teaching students aged 10–12 years during the first two years of implementing programming in the mathematics curriculum. Informed by Chevallard’s praxeology in terms of praxis and logos, we describe, unpack, discuss and expand these activities. Core issues related to algebra found in the three activities are as follows: making implicit variables explicit; using a counter variable; and identifying parameters as a specific type of variable. Our findings show that, in addition to already identified uses of variables in early algebra, programming activities in the early years bring in new aspects and new ways of treating variables that could, potentially, enhance students’ understanding of variables and generalization, provided that programming praxis is embedded in an appropriate algebra logos.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The International Mathematical Olympiad, now 62 years old, has catalyzed the formation of a remarkable international community that meets for 2 weeks each year to celebrate mathematical problem solving. It has influenced and expanded the greater global mathematical culture, and the value of problem-solving in numerous countries. It is time for the mathematics competition community to reach out and pose questions for serious inquiry. What is the extent of this influence? What are its effects? Reciprocally, what effects have different mathematical traditions had on the IMO? Some significant studies have been done to answer such questions, but several remain unanswered, and most remain unposed. We survey the work that has been done, then some anecdotal evidence, including case studies of the participation of individual countries in the IMO. We then suggest some topics needing a deeper inquiry. The intention of this article is to invite the research community to work with the IMO community in a serious investigation of the half-century of experience afforded us by the IMO.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>A key aspect of young children’s development of algebraic reasoning is the process of visualising and identifying structures to both abstract and generalise. There has been a growing body of research focused on how students form generalisations, this article adds to the existing body of research by examining how young culturally diverse students identify mathematical structures in contextual growing patterns and the teaching and learning actions that assist them to generalise. Data were collected from one classroom of 29 Year Two (6 years old) students in a low socio-economic school in New Zealand. Results from the analysis of lessons related to two tasks showed that the contextual tasks led students to notice different mathematical structures. Specific pedagogical actions were used to facilitate students’ engagement with the growing patterns. These included positioning students to engage with different representations (pictorial and numerical, tabular, and natural language) to represent thinking, the use of classroom discussions, noticing and responding to student thinking, and pressing students to find far terms. The findings highlight that both the contextual patterning tasks and teacher actions supported the young students to develop a range of sophisticated generalisations related to the underlying mathematical structure and functional relationships of the growing patterns.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence, attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary classrooms.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Social media is an increasingly prevalent informal learning site for mathematics teachers. These platforms offer an emotionally and philosophically supportive space for teachers who seek to address oppressive teaching practices within their school communities. In this paper, we examine interactions in a Facebook group with over 14,000 members to understand how a social media platform can be used by teachers to develop professionally. In our analysis of interactions within the Facebook group, we found teachers often use this space to seek support in combating the negative effects of tracking while also seeking support to better implement mixed ability learning opportunities. Through comments, community members encourage rehumanizing mathematics classrooms by promoting practices of creative insubordination (Gutiérrez in Teach Excell Equity
