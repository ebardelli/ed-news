  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the development of a guidance document titled the “Framework for Equitable Instruction” (Framework), which aims to support multilingual students’ content-area learning and language development. The Framework was developed by WIDA, a national consortium of states, as part of its system of language standards, assessments, and professional learning. The article discusses the Framework using a protocol originally created for the alignment of content-area and language standards. The protocol highlights the rigorous theoretical foundations of the Framework, the research-based rationale behind its conceptualization of language trajectories, and the tight linkages between the Framework, content-area standards, and classroom instruction. The systematic exploration of the Framework’s features in this article can inform the future design of language standards and related documents and serve as a foundation for the constructive critique of existing ones.

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of the paper is to show whether the systems of mathematics teacher education in two countries whose historical development may seem quite similar (the Czech Republic and Hungary were parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, and they were part of the Eastern European communist block) are also very similar, or whether each country follows its own, unique path. In this paper we build on the general need for more international comparative studies in the area of teacher education. We present a historical review of development of mathematics teacher education in both countries and analyse and compare current teacher education programs, their structure and organization, the demands on mathematics teachers and their qualifications for teaching at various levels. In the paper we pinpoint a number of aspects resulting in differences in the two systems, including historical development and traditions, (de)-centralization, globalization and international cooperation, etc. The comparison based on these aspects shows that the systems in both countries are very different. The analysis described in this paper could become the starting point for further research using the data from international surveys (e.g. PISA). Such research would enable us to make conjectures about the effects of various ways of organizing teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we discuss students’ opportunities to learn to pose mathematical problems, based on a historical analysis of problem posing in the area of number and algebra in six series of Chinese primary school mathematics textbooks published since the 1950s. We examine changes in the proportion and distribution of the problem-posing tasks, and in the presentation of the problem-posing tasks. Our results show a decreasing number of problem-posing tasks as grade level increases, even though problem posing has become more important in mathematics education in China during the last 70 years. This study also provides a variety of examples of problem-posing tasks which could serve as a reference for teachers in other countries in designing and employing problem-posing tasks in the classroom.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Levering change is hard, and an incremental process. In the education process it requires an interaction between teachers, resources and learners. Levering change with human resources—teachers themselves, is a long term, time-intensive process requiring investment and commitment. The teacher–resources relationship is complex and not always optimal, particularly in disadvantaged educational environments where resources are constrained, and the education system is centralized and highly regulated. This article posits a mathematics teaching framework developed in a low-income educational context to make more transparent the relationship between teachers and resources to the benefit of learning both of teachers and of learners.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The Race to the Top (RTTT) program incentivized states to use innovation for systemwide improvement of student outcomes, but little is known about how RTTT-funded innovation was sustained after the RTTT program ended. This mixed-methods study examined state and district approaches to sustaining an international innovation called lesson study, a teacher-driven, collaborative, inquiry-based teacher learning process imported from Japan and promoted statewide in Florida. While the state’s role in sustaining lesson study was limited, we found that districts that integrated lesson study into the district instructional system through a clear expectation and strategic adaptation, supported school and teacher ownership of lesson study practice, and provided necessary support and funding were more likely to sustain lesson study. In contrast, the districts that focused on implementation fidelity and district-led facilitation eventually phased out lesson study. Policy implications for sustaining federally funded professional development innovations are discussed.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines how school leaders working within schools serving immigrant English Learners negotiate teacher evaluation policies, including how they influence compliance with mandated policies, communicate those policies to teachers, and guide implementation within their professional communities. We explore how a leader in a school with positive outcomes negotiates external policies to support authentic professional growth and maximize learning opportunities for immigrant ELs. In addition, we draw on data from a comparison school that also serves a high proportion of ELs, but where policies have been enacted in ways that focus on compliance, increase anxiety, and add little value to EL students. In doing so, we show how leaders can mitigate the unintended consequences of mandated policies by addressing teachers’ uncertainty and anxieties, while reaffirming humanizing institutional practices that honor the local knowledge of teachers and deepen teachers’ collective responsibility for immigrant youth.

  Abstract
                  <p>Past studies have documented some pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) difficulties in reasoning about sampling variability. This study adds to the body of literature by investigating the ideas that PSTs employ in reasoning about sampling variability, and by conjecturing what is behind the difficulties especially during the contextuality episodes. This issue was studied in the context of a content course on statistics and probability for elementary and middle grade PSTs at a Midwestern American university. An analysis of a PST’s video and screen records of a task-based interview was guided by techniques of knowledge analysis (diSessa et al., 2016), and focused on two clear contextuality episodes that have caused disequilibrium in the PST’s knowledge system. The analysis described at a moment-by-moment level the cognitive dynamics of the transitions that occurred in the PST’s knowledge system and highlighted some of the difficulties that arise from the activation of less-productive knowledge elements over others. The significance of this study is in its use for the techniques of knowledge analysis from the field of cognitive science to provide a fine-grained description of PSTs’ difficulties in reasoning about sampling variability that went beyond the traditional description of these difficulties as misconceptions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper presents a praxeological analysis, based on ATD (Anthropological Theory of the Didactic), of the topic of Fourier series, as this topic is introduced and used in mathematics and in electrical engineering, more precisely in signal theory. The analysis is based mainly on one widely used textbook in mathematics for engineers, and a textbook and video lectures in signal theory. The aim of the analysis is to investigate possible differences in the motivation for introducing Fourier series in mathematics and in signal theory, as well as differences in the techniques used, and the justifications behind the techniques. This research is inspired by previous research showing lack of connection between mathematics courses and engineering courses applying mathematics. To get a wider perspective, the exposition in the textbook in mathematics for engineers is also compared to the exposition in more advanced books in mathematics. To add to the perspective, the historical origin of Fourier series is also discussed. The findings show that there are differences in the motivation for the topic both between mathematics and signal theory, but also between basic and more advanced mathematics. Within mathematics there are also differences in the underlying theories.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study explores how teachers’ unions are responding to the growing policy of dual enrollment (DE). I reviewed all available collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) of public schools in Ohio, using qualitative content analysis to look for ways that CBAs are addressing DE policy. Analysis revealed four themes. The first theme suggests that teachers’ unions are incrementally bargaining provisions addressing DE into their CBAs. Of the 586 CBAs analyzed, 160 included provisions regarding DE. The three remaining themes centered around working conditions for teachers, including provisions related to monetary compensation, existential protection of bargaining unit members, and the protection of teacher time. Additionally, district typography was explored, revealing that wealthier/smaller school districts have bargained more teacher protections for DE than larger districts with less wealth. This study provides information about what might be of interest to teachers and policymakers when reforming DE policy.
