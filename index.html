  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This review examines the concept of organizational routines and its potential for investigating educational initiatives in practice. The studies in our review revealed three different approaches to routines: (1) examining organizational routines as entities, (2) (also) examining conversational routines, and (3) examining the internal structure of organizational routines. Current definitions, operationalizations, and examinations can lack clarity and validity. At present, the concept of organizational routines not only holds potential but is also ambiguous. To bolster the potential of the concept, two working definitions of organizational routines are formalized that best allow researchers to investigate initiatives in practice. These working definitions are needed to create clarity regarding the concept and for it to be able to deliver on its promise for providing meaningful and relevant information on how new initiatives actually work and unfold in practice.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In the present meta-analysis, we systematically investigated the relative contributions of students’ initial mathematics, reading, and cognitive skills on subsequent mathematics performance measured at least 3 months later. With one-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling, we conducted analyses based on 580,437 students from 265 independent samples and 250 studies. Findings suggested fluency in both mathematics and reading, as well as working memory, yielded greater impacts on subsequent mathematics performance. Age emerged as a significant moderator in the model, such that the effects of comprehensive mathematics and working memory on subsequent mathematics increased with age, whereas attention and self-regulation’s impacts declined with age. Time lag between assessments also emerged as a significant moderator, such that the effects of word-problem solving and word recognition accuracy decreased as the time lag increased, whereas vocabulary, attention, and self-regulation’s effects increased as the time lag increased.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>In many school districts, the policies that regulate teaching personnel are governed by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). While there is significant policy attention that has affected the scope of these agreements, there is relatively little research on how CBAs vary over time, or whether they change in response to states’ legislative reforms. Using a panel data set of over 1,200 CBAs across three states, we compare CBA change before and after reforms in two states (Michigan and Washington) relative to a state with no statutory changes (California). We show that the state policy reforms lessened the restrictiveness of CBAs, as intended. The results suggest when reforms limit bargaining negotiations, unions are unable to compensate for the substantial reductions in working conditions.

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper belongs to a field of research that has appeared comparatively recently, namely, the study of mathematics competitions. The paper utilizes historical-theoretical methodology and is devoted to changes in the way in which mathematics competitions have been conducted in Russia in recent decades. Mathematics competitions, like mathematics education as a whole, are seen as part of a social process, and changes in them are seen as expressions of new social needs and possibilities. The analysis of the system of competitions, as it evolved in the USSR, and the literature devoted to them, makes it possible to identify certain challenges recognized by the mathematics community. In this paper I discuss examples of new competitions that have emerged to address these challenges. It is noted that new types of competitions have emerged, including team competitions and competitions involving mass participation by students. Also discussed is the emergence of new competitions with subject matter closer to that of ordinary school mathematics than that of old, traditional competitions. An analysis of the situation in Russia reveals the existence of a significant group of mathematics educators, parents, and children interested in the development of mathematics competitions. Also, in the paper I call attention to certain questions that I consider worthy of further study.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In Germany, the Abitur is the highest qualification granted at the end of secondary education after 12 or 13 years of schooling; it provides a general university entrance qualification. Traditionally, written and oral examinations are required to obtain the Abitur. Until 1990, there were mainly decentralized examinations in mathematics in West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany [FRG]), which were taken after 13 school years, and a centralized examination that students took after 12 years of school in East Germany (German Democratic Republic [GDR]). In the unified Germany, examinations are now increasingly set by the 16 individual federal states. This paper has a special focus on changes and permanent features in the written Abitur examination in mathematics in Germany in the context of the social changes caused by the German reunification in 1990. These changes since 1990 are described with regard to the initial situation and framing conditions for the written Abitur examination. Two time periods are considered: (1) the examination situation in the FRG and GDR before 1990 and (2) the changes in the five eastern German federal states (former GDR) under the system change and accession to the FRG after 1990 but before the PISA shock.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Russian culture developed under the burden of a series of totalitarian governments, a circumstance that, oddly, supported mathematics education. The Soviet period in particular saw a flowering of mathematical culture, the seeds of which have, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, been carried to the rest of Europe and America. A trickle of ideas, materials—and émigrés—has swollen to a powerful stream. Some of the heaviest influences have occurred in the field of extra-curricular education. We explore some of the ways that Russian and Soviet mathematical culture has fertilized this field. In particular, we look closely at the pivotal role of the professional mathematical communities, both in Russia and in America.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The political changes in the USSR and Russia almost coincided with the beginning of an unprecedented leap in the development of information technologies in the country (and to a certain extent spurred it). Gradually, many different initiatives emerged to apply these technologies in education in general, and in mathematics education. In the paper, we discuss several examples of didactical innovations in teaching and learning mathematics with technology, namely, LOGO-based microworlds, dynamic geometry and computer algebra systems, as well as verifiers. The examples we provide, along with the theoretical perspective of productive learning and thinking, seem to demonstrate the innovative potential of new tools to make learning more visual, dynamic, and interactive. However, the issues of aligning with curriculum and standard examinations, teacher professional development, and rapid changes in technologies, require more attention by mathematics educators. The presence of such opposite trends makes the task of analyzing the history of the development of mathematics teaching technologies and underlying pedagogies relevant and important for predicting the development of this field in the near (and far-extended) future, and eventually preventing the repetition of errors in this new direction for mathematics education. In the paper we focus primarily on problems and processes in Russia, but they are investigated in connection with and against the backdrop of global trends.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper we present a study of the most important Polish periodicals of the last 30 years that are related to mathematics education. Our research aim was to analyse how the changes in mathematics education that were caused by a new political situation in Poland were reflected in education journals. Journals that shaped Polish mathematics education varied significantly. We analysed both those journals that have a long history and those that arose spontaneously, thus reflecting the mood of this time of great change. Our analysis leads to the conclusion that journals, where the authors are mostly mathematics scientists or university lecturers, turned out to be in different to shifts in the educational system. A characteristic tendency reflecting the mood of times of change was the creation of new magazines, which were to be forums for sharing views on teaching mathematics. It turns out, however, that the journals created after 1990 had quite a short lifespan. Education journals that were directed to teachers for decades constituted a platform for discussion of new ideas and teaching styles, too. They offered a place to exchange opposing views. However, this situation slowly ceased to apply.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper is devoted to changes in the way in which mathematical assessment is conducted in Russia and Ukraine, the two largest states formed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Previously, in the USSR, there existed two parallel systems of examinations, as follows: exit exams, which were taken by schoolchildren graduating from high schools, and which were conducted using the same texts across the entire territory of each Soviet republic; and entrance exams, which each college conducted independently (with the approval of the Ministry). In the new states, a gradual transition occurred to conducting so-called uniform exams, in which exit and entrance exams were combined. This change reflected society’s quest for a fair and effective system, which could avoid corruption, unfairness toward different categories of students, and the like. In this paper, examinations are analyzed as an expression of society’s influence on the teaching of mathematics. Consequently, the paper analyzes, on the one hand, the stages in the appearance and formation of examination procedures, the problems offered on exams, and the influence of exams on the teaching of mathematics; and on the other hand, the attitude toward exams in society, discussion of them in the press, and other general issues. A necessary space in the paper is allocated to background information, with a discussion of how exams were conducted in the USSR and of the general changes that have taken place in both countries.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>For a long time, Soviet students learned ‘pure’ mathematics in their mathematics classrooms, while applications of mathematics were introduced in their science (mainly physics) classrooms. This approach was a part of a uniform and rigid national curriculum. Even when in the 1990s the world was moving towards including applications in school mathematics, Russian students continued to engage in pure mathematics learning in their mathematics classrooms. It was physics teachers’ responsibility to teach applications of mathematics; therefore, physics courses were highly mathematics-intensive, making extensive use of mathematics from algebra to calculus in the formulation of scientific laws and the investigation of their consequences. The collapse of the Soviet Union and some liberalization in educational policy led to changes in graduation requirements in mathematics and physics as well as diversity in mathematics and physics curricula in schools. Based on a review of textbooks, standards, curriculum documents, and other resources, in this paper we analyze changes that affected the teaching and learning of mathematics in physics classrooms in Russia from the Soviet period to the present.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The educational literature often includes debate over the nature and nurture of mathematical giftedness. The varied schools of thought reflect discrepancies between views, which are to a large extent functions of philosophical, political, and economic considerations. To address this debate, in the context of the current ZDM Special Issue, I attempt to analyze research and practices linked to mathematical giftedness in the Soviet Union in 1960–1980. I also look at the continuation of these Soviet-era practices, and to their influence on practices internationally. Particular attention is paid to the literature devoted to reaching a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of mathematical giftedness and of ways of nurturing this giftedness. The analysis starts with the discussion of domain-specific and domain-general characteristics of mathematical giftedness that have to be taken into account in educational environments for the mathematically gifted. It continues with a review of practices in special mathematical schools and classes in the Soviet Union, and a comparison to similar settings around the world in the twenty-first century. There is also an overview of enrichment mathematical activities, with a focus on mathematical circles, mathematical competitions and Olympiads, accompanied by a description of specificities of the mathematical content employed for the promotion of mathematical giftedness. Finally, the paper focuses on the question of what characterizes an excellent teacher of mathematically gifted students and on new educational technologies that are changing the education of these students worldwide. Following this analysis, I suggest some open questions for future research on the education of mathematically gifted students.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The aim of the paper is to show whether the systems of mathematics teacher education in two countries whose historical development may seem quite similar (the Czech Republic and Hungary were parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, and they were part of the Eastern European communist block) are also very similar, or whether each country follows its own, unique path. In this paper we build on the general need for more international comparative studies in the area of teacher education. We present a historical review of development of mathematics teacher education in both countries and analyse and compare current teacher education programs, their structure and organization, the demands on mathematics teachers and their qualifications for teaching at various levels. In the paper we pinpoint a number of aspects resulting in differences in the two systems, including historical development and traditions, (de)-centralization, globalization and international cooperation, etc. The comparison based on these aspects shows that the systems in both countries are very different. The analysis described in this paper could become the starting point for further research using the data from international surveys (e.g. PISA). Such research would enable us to make conjectures about the effects of various ways of organizing teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The aspiration of this paper is to develop a novel approach towards investigating the socio-political history of mathematics teaching in educational systems. Traditionally, historical studies are confined to just one country, the author’s country. Broader approaches address international developments by confronting and comparing global and local aspects—revealing general patterns and more specific ‘local’ structures and characteristics. Yet, already in antiquity and medieval times, the specific characteristic of mathematics teaching, namely to operate at the crossroads of general education and vocational training, proved to be intimately tied to the functioning of the particular political system. In pre-modern times, however, a truly international pattern emerged for the first time: European powers conquered, occupied and colonised overseas regions. Given that educational systems were emerging at the same time within these states, they often transmitted elements of these structures to their colonies. This phenomenon included mathematics, and the history of its teaching is analysed here as a part of coloniality. It is shown that this was not a uniform process, and the differences between the various colonial powers are discussed. The involvement of mathematics in the process of decolonisation is addressed, as well as its role in the tension between continued coloniality and movements of decoloniality. Finally, the general framework provided for studying socio-political processes connected with establishing mathematics teaching within public educational systems is applied, in order to analyse recent coloniality practices effected by international achievement studies.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and Russia, the largest of the countries formed in its place, has gone through notable changes in the period since then. This paper is devoted to the study of how (and whether) the mathematics curriculum has changed. At one time, before the revolution of 1917, Russian mathematics education was closely connected with Western European mathematics education (above all, German and French). Subsequently, their paths diverged, and later, Russian mathematics education became very highly regarded around the world. What, then, has happened over the last three decades? To what extent does the Russian curriculum today differ from the old Soviet curriculum and from contemporary curricula in other countries? The answers to these questions are of interest to an international audience already because they help in understanding the processes and distinctive characteristics of the development of mathematics education, including differences that might be concealed even behind identical terms. Based on a detailed analysis of Russian standards and textbooks, conclusions are drawn about the processes in the transformation of the curriculum that have occurred over thirty years, including the conclusion that the period of transition that began in the late 1980s is still not over. The Russian curriculum, of course, is not exactly the same as the curriculum of Soviet times, but the differences between them are by no means revolutionary. The paths of the development of mathematics education in Russia and in Western Europe and the United States, having at some point diverged, have still not come back together.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>We used an assessment platform to study the potential of rich student data obtained online to influence classroom instruction and help teachers respond to students’ needs. The article focuses on technology-based formative assessment in the course of teaching a unit on quadrilaterals. We studied example-eliciting tasks, requiring students to determine the truth of a given claim and to use interactive diagrams to construct examples to support their answer. Our aim was to teach the concept of parallelogram by exploring students’ concept images and responding adequately to their submissions. A group of 11-year-old students studied the unit as part of their geometry curriculum. We used an assessment platform, which provides tools designed to monitor examples produced by students interacting with a dynamic geometry environment and to characterize critical and non-critical attributes of the submitted constructions. We present the teaching decisions made by the teacher (the first author), who used automatic feedback on the characteristics of three assessment tasks.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers currently gain increasing attention, as their practices are crucial for the success of spreading mathematics educational ideas and innovations into schools and strengthening the professional expertise of teachers. So far, mainly two components of facilitation have been empirically researched: facilitators’ knowledge resources and facilitation moves. In this paper, we propose to develop a more comprehensive conceptual framework in order to explain facilitators’ practices and underlying decisions. For this purpose, we lift Schoenfeld’s ROG framework for teachers' decision-making (comprising resources, orientations, and goals) to the facilitator level, and add identity as a fourth component to obtain what we call the ROGI framework. We draw on data collected simultaneously in two PD projects for mathematics teachers in Germany and in Israel. Through three cases of facilitation, we illustrate how the adapted ROGI framework helps to understand processes of decision-making made by facilitators during mathematics professional development sessions.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Propensity score methods provide data preprocessing tools to remove selection bias and attain statistically comparable groups – the first requirement when attempting to estimate causal effects with observational data. Although guidelines exist on how to remove selection bias when groups in comparison are large, not much is known on how to proceed when one of the groups in comparison, for example, a treated group, is particularly small, or when the study also includes lots of observed covariates (relative to the treated group’s sample size). This article investigates whether propensity score methods can help us to remove selection bias in studies with small treated groups and large amount of observed covariates. We perform a series of simulation studies to study factors such as sample size ratio of control to treated units, number of observed covariates and initial imbalances in observed covariates between the groups of units in comparison, that is, selection bias. The results demonstrate that selection bias can be removed with small treated samples, but under different conditions than in studies with large treated samples. For example, a study design with 10 observed covariates and eight treated units will require the control group to be at least 10 times larger than the treated group, whereas a study with 500 treated units will require at least, only, two times bigger control group. To confirm the usefulness of simulation study results for practice, we carry out an empirical evaluation with real data. The study provides insights for practice and directions for future research.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Empirical data show that the COVID-19 pandemic deepened and exacerbated social inequalities, to the detriment of low-income communities of color. Using the law as a conceptual framework and legal research methodology, this study examines education law against the exacerbated social inequalities low-income students of color faced during the pandemic. Considering the bounds of the law against the exacerbated social inequalities surfaces the limitations of the law in a time of large-scale crisis and thereby exposes issues of educational inequity. In this context, policymakers bear the responsibility to adopt policies that promote educational equity. The study brings educational law and policy issues in the COVID-19 context to the fore of the educational equity discourse within the educational research community and has implications for policy and practice as well. The study is of import as educational researchers continue to examine the impact of COVID-19 across numerous social contexts and disciplines.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Many students suffer from motivational problems when doing homework. To investigate whether an intervention that effectively promoted value beliefs in mathematics promoted students’ homework motivation and behavior, we analyzed data from a cluster randomized controlled study with two classroom-based relevance interventions (writing a text or evaluating quotes from interviews) with 82 classrooms and 1,978 ninth-grade students. Students’ math-specific homework motivation and behavior were assessed with homework diaries over a period of 4 weeks after the intervention. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that students in the text condition reported higher triggered interest but also lower homework completion than students in the control condition in the first week after the intervention. Students in the quotations condition reported higher utility of homework for future life, and higher homework effort directly after the intervention. The study highlights the potential of classroom-based relevance interventions to foster homework-specific outcomes, when considering situational, behavior-related measures.
