  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundFinite mixture models cluster individuals into latent subgroups based on observed traits. However, inaccurate enumeration of clusters can have lasting implications on policy decisions and allocations of resources. Applied and methodological researchers accept no obvious best model fit statistic, and different measures could suggest different numbers of latent clusters.ObjectivesThe purpose of this article is to evaluate and compare different cluster enumeration techniques.Research DesignStudy I demonstrates how recently proposed resampling methods result in no precise number of clusters on which all fit statistics agree. We recommend the pre-processing method in Study II as an alternative. Both studies used nationally representative data on working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control.ConclusionsThe data plus priors method shows promise to address inconsistencies among fit measures and help applied researchers using finite mixture models in the future.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, we provide a comprehensive, empirical assessment of the hypothesis that the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) affected hospital readmissions. In doing so, we provide evidence as to the validity of prior empirical approaches used to evaluate the HRRP and we present results from a previously unused approach to study this research question—a regression-kink design. Results of our analysis document that the empirical approaches used in most prior research assessing the efficacy of the HRRP often lack internal validity. Therefore, results from these studies may not be informative about the causal consequences of the HRRP. Results from our regression-kink analysis, which we validate, suggest that the HRRP had little effect on hospital readmissions. This finding contrasts with the results of most prior studies, which report that the HRRP significantly reduced readmissions. Our finding is consistent with conceptual considerations related to the assumptions underlying HRRP penalty: in particular, the difficulty of identifying preventable readmissions, the highly imperfect risk adjustment that affects the penalty determination, and the absence of proven tools to reduce readmissions.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>The medical education system in the United States has gone through a rapid transition to emergency remote teaching as a consequence of the COVID 19 pandemic. For the Engineering Medicine (EnMed) track of the College of Medicine at Texas A&amp;M University, the most challenging aspects are the transition from in-class team-based learning (TBL) to online sessions and virtual facilitation with an interdisciplinary group of faculties. This article outlines the TBL format used in the EnMed curriculum, along with challenges in delivery, student perspective, and strategies for transitioning existing TBL online.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We conceptualize students’ opportunities to learn remotely during the initial school closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We conceptualize students’ opportunities to learn remotely during the initial school closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. We then examine variation in remote instruction using an original statewide survey of teachers in Tennessee, deployed just a few weeks into the closures. Using three-level logistic regression models, we explore potential predictors of regular remote instruction, including prepandemic measures of broadband access, the demographic composition of schools, and measures of district policy responses created from districts’ public COVID-19 plans. We find that teachers in schools serving more economically disadvantaged students and in rural districts are less likely to report regular remote instruction, especially via providing digital resources and holding virtual classes or tutoring. Fewer opportunities for Tennessee’s rural students appear driven in part by lower community access to high-speed broadband, but district policies to distribute technology may partially mitigate this gap in access.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this review, we explore economic imperialism, a concept that captures the phenomenon of a single discipline’s power over so many facets of social life and policy—including education. Through a systematic search, we examine how economic imperialism has been conceptualized and applied across fields. We uncovered three key, interconnected elements of economic imperialism that hold relevance for education research. First, economics has colonized other disciplines, narrowing the lens through which policymakers have designed education reforms. Second, an overreliance on economic rationales for human behavior neglects other explanations. Third, a focus on economic outcomes of education has subjugated other important aims of education. We share implications for researchers to use economic theory in ways that are interdisciplinary but not imperialist.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>In this qualitative case study, we employ 29 semistructured interviews and an array of supplemental data to explore why and how COVID-19 shaped school and community practices around student and family homelessness in Houston, Texas. Drawing on Small’s notion of organizational embeddedness, we find that COVID-19 fundamentally altered school and community practices, as educators and providers faced resource constraints, new concerns about safety, and evolving student and family needs. Providers struggled to meet the depth of need stemming from COVID-19; however, they also embraced innovation in adapting their practices to the pandemic era. We find that this adaptation occurred along a continuum, ranging from pausing or stopping existing practices to developing new practices from scratch. We conclude with implications for theory, research, policy, and practice.

Building on data of an ongoing longitudinal study, we studied the roles of children’s (N = 63) academic skills before the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany (March–June 2020) as predictors of individual differences in parental schoolwork support during the lockdown, and the contributions of parental and teacher support to students’ reading and mathematics skills after the lockdown. Findings indicated that children’s reading and mathematics skills before the lockdown predicted parental help, and reading skills predicted parental need-oriented support with schoolwork during the lockdown. Children who received more need-oriented support from parents showed a more favorable development of arithmetic skills across the lockdown. Indicators of teacher support did not explain individual differences in students’ academic skills after the lockdown period.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Teachers participate in professional learning activities to enhance their pedagogical knowledge and share best practices—and the increasing role of technologies in education, including social media, is shifting how this professional learning occurs. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to consider the role of social media for professional learning. Using intensive longitudinal methods, we repeatedly surveyed 14 teachers’ use of social media both before and during the pandemic (N = 386 total responses). We found patterns in social media platforms uptake and their purposes, but teachers’ use of social media was largely idiosyncratic. Also, teachers demonstrated notable shifts in social media use after the pandemic started; multilevel models indicated that teachers were more likely to use social media to connect and share, especially, as well as learn and follow, compared with before the pandemic. Higher levels of COVID-19-related family stress were also associated with more use of social media to find materials.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>In this time of global pandemic, there has been much adult discourse around what children need both academically and at home, emphasizing structure and continued learning across content areas. Missing from these discussions and recommendations are the perspectives of children themselves. Children, many of whom lack access to their own communication devices as well as social media and personal e-mail accounts, have felt the impact of separation from peers. This article examines ways in which a diverse group of 9- and 10-year-old children resisted the isolating circumstances early in the COVID-19 pandemic through creating and repurposing digital spaces to connect with friends, classmates, and family members.1

  Abstract
                  <p>Although strong references to expertise in different theoretical approaches to teacher noticing have been made in the last decades, empirical knowledge about the development of teacher noticing from novice to expert level is scarce. The present study aims to close this research gap by comparing three different groups of mathematics teachers with different degrees of professional teaching experience—pre-service teachers at the master’s level, early career teachers, and experienced teachers—using data sampled in the frame of the research program from the Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M). Furthermore, the construct of teacher noticing is assessed in a differentiated way by analyzing different noticing facets. Findings confirm that three facets of teacher noticing can be empirically distinguished—perception of important classroom events, their interpretation, and decisions regarding further developments. The results reveal a considerable increase in professional noticing between master’s students and practicing teachers. However, in contrast to other studies, among examples from East Asia, a stagnation or decrease in professional noticing between early career teachers and experienced teachers could be observed. Overall, the study highlights the cultural dependency of expertise development regarding teachers’ noticing.</p>

It includes camera movements to guide children’s visual attention through the pictures and the possibility to control page-turning and the pace at which the camera moves through pictures. There were 56 participants (Mage = 60.34 months, SD = 6.24) randomly assigned to three conditions: still images, camera movements (no control over pace), and camera movements (control over pace). For the 50% of children least proficient in language skills, sparingly adding well-chosen camera movements to the illustrations helps children understand the story. In addition, the camera movements’ effect can be enhanced by enabling control over the pace at which new information appears. Particularly the 50% low-language proficiency children benefited from camera movements and spending more time processing information.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Experimental evidence on strategies to support refugee children's integration into host-country public schools is needed. We employ a three-arm, site-randomized controlled trial to test the impact of short-term access to two versions of nonformal remedial programming infused with social-emotional learning (SEL) among Syrian refugee children in Lebanese public schools. Remedial programming with classroom climate-targeted SEL practices improved children's perceptions of public schools (effect sizes [ES] = 0.48–0.66) only. The remedial program with both classroom climate-targeted SEL and skill-targeted activities had positive impacts on children's perceptions of public schools (ES = 0.43–0.50) and on certain basic academic skills (ES = 0.08–0.14), and marginally significant positive and negative impacts on some SEL outcomes (ES = 0.16–0.31). We found no impacts of either version on children's global literacy or numeracy competence.
