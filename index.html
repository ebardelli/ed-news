  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Evaluation of public programs has undergone many changes over the past four decades since Peter Rossi coined his “Iron Law” of program evaluation: “The expected value of any net impact assessment of any large-scale social program is zero.” While that assessment may be somewhat overstated, the essence still holds. The failures far outnumber the successes, and the estimated favorable effects are rarely sizeable. Findings: Despite this grim assessment, much can be learned from “failed” experiments, and from ones that are successful in only some sites or subgroups. Advances in study design, statistical models, data, and how inferences are drawn from estimates have substantially improved our analyses and will continue to do so. However, the most actual learning about “what works” (and why, when, and where) is likely to come from gathering more detailed and comprehensive data on how the intervention was implemented and attempting to link that data to estimated impacts. Researchers need detailed data on the target population served, the content of the intervention, and the process by which it is delivered to participating service providers and individuals. Two examples presented here illustrate how researchers drew useful broader lessons from impact estimates for a set of related programs. Conclusion: Rossi posited three reasons most interventions fail—wrong question, wrong intervention, poor implementation. Speeding the accumulation of wisdom about how social programs can best help vulnerable populations will require that researchers work closely with program funders, developers, operators, and participants to gather and interpret these detailed data about program implementation.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Research on teacher churn has produced conflicting conclusions as to its impact on students and teachers. We bring clarity to this work by combining and expanding on analytical approaches used in earlier research to determine how and when different types of churn (i.e., grade, school) impact teacher effectiveness and attendance. Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, our results suggest differences based on analytical approach but ultimately show that changing schools and grades may be less of an issue than previously reported. In addition, in the case of school churn, a beneficial match in their new school sites may matter more for teacher outcomes than potential disruptive effects of churn. We conclude with implications for policy and future research.

Shelby Clark and Madora Soutter describe how growth mindsets are related to, yet distinct from, intellectual risk-taking and share strategies for fostering both in students. The strategies come from their yearlong research project observing classes and interviewing students and teachers at a high school that uses a discussion-based pedagogy known as the Harkness method.

When Nathan was overwhelmed, Carmen Torres, a bilingual science teacher, reassured her and became a model for how to lead her classroom. When Carmen died in April 2022, Nathan shared her story with other teachers and school leaders who have been inspired both to consider who their Carmens have been and to be Carmens for new teachers in their schools.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 1, Page 58-59, September 2022. <br> As new school leaders take over the district’s top jobs this fall, they and their communities face transitions. Joshua P. Starr explains that too many leaders focus on entry and fail to engage in a thoughtful and comprehensive transition process. Transition isn’t just about change; it’s also about loss. Organizational transition is about how people respond to these changed circumstances. Even if people are ready and eager to embrace the new beginning, they still lose their old way of doing business. For those who resist the new or are just unsure of what it means for them, their sense of loss can manifest in active opposition to a leader’s new ideas. A good transition process involves the creation of a transition team with committees made up of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and community members, who will be more likely to support plans that come from their work.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 1, Page 62-63, September 2022. <br> The biggest threat to an equitable and prosperous American society is not a particular educational policy, but the gravitational pull of politics, explains Jonathan Collins. Before educational policy can be developed and put into place, the politics that drive education must be acknowledged and addressed. Violence is erupting at school board meetings across the country over mask mandates, book bans, and critical race theory. Meanwhile, as has been the case throughout U.S. history, the political division and vitriol distract us from ensuring that our most vulnerable children are getting needed academic support. It is time, Collins says, for a politics of solutions that can defy the gravitational pull of politics that sidetrack leaders addressing the real problems students face.

Makin, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, if a state offers tuition assistance for students to attend private schools, then requiring that those private schools be nonsectarian violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Robert Kim discusses how this case aligns with other decisions related to the free exercise of religion as it applies to public schools and what it could mean for schools going forward. Carson v. Makin, he explains, is one of several cases that open the door for states to fund religious education. At the same time, recent cases show that these schools may be allowed to discriminate against students and teachers while continuing to receive state funds.

James responds to a March 2022 Kappan article in which high school student Colin McGrath warned his younger brother of the burden that pointless homework assignments will play in his life when he enters high school. James suggests that, although some teachers may assign work with little value, most assignments do serve to either reinforce or expand on what students have learned in class. She urges teachers and students to think of homework as opportunities for learning at home. Ideally, teachers will explain the purpose of any at-home learning and give students options for engaging in such learning, using their individual intelligences to master the content.

The September 2022 issue of Kappan explores the circumstances making education especially challenging and suggests solutions.

The pandemic likely will continue to exact a toll on the mental health of the teaching workforce. A silver lining from COVID-19 could come from teacher stress research conducted during the pandemic, which provides directions for how to improve the occupational lives of teachers. To this end, Christopher McCarthy, Madison Blaydes, Caroline H. Weppner, &amp; Richard G. Lambert briefly review how teacher stress is defined, how it was exacerbated by the pandemic, and what can be done to alleviate it and promote wellness going forward.

Marshall, Tim Pressley, Natalie M. Neugebauer, &amp; David M. Shannon review research from before and during the pandemic to learn what makes teachers likely to leave the profession and share results from their May 2022 survey of 830 teachers. Around three-fourths of teachers surveyed had considered leaving their positions during the 2022-23 school year, with more than half considering positions outside education. Teachers describe the increased workload, ongoing stress, and lack of support from administrators and parents as factors that led them to consider leaving.

The district’s progressive and anti-racist stance led many white educators to assume that their colleagues did not experience interpersonal or institutional racism. However, when Doris Santoro, Julia Hazel, and Alberto Morales interviewed educators throughout the district they found that experiences of racism were pervasive. Knowing that white educators might tend to deny that reality and not wanting to further burden the district’s educators of color with sharing their trauma or observing their colleagues’ ignorance, they undertook a deliberate process to share their findings in ways that considered the needs of all educators in the system.

The interviews depict both the anti-Blackness that Black teachers face and their freedom dreams for a better tomorrow for their students. Ultimately, Black teachers want schools to be transformed into healing-centered spaces where they can show up authentically to create a world in which Blackness is centered and affirmed.

Some teachers have reported that they have considered leaving the profession because of a lack of advancement opportunities. Jennifer Wu-Pope explains how research-practice partnerships can play a role in retaining these teachers while leveraging their expertise in educational improvement efforts. Participation in research-practice partnerships could be offered as a professional advancement track option for teachers. Providing that option as a hybrid position in which teachers remain in the classroom for part of their day while using the rest of their time for research can be one way to address dissatisfaction among high-performing teachers.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 1, Page 44-49, September 2022. <br> Social-emotional learning (SEL) programs have become one of the most popular tools that schools use to help students learn to manage their emotions and build better relationships. But Dennis Shirley and Andy Hargreaves argue that these programs are insufficient to help students face today’s challenges. It would be far better, they explain, for schools to focus on programs that enhance students’ well-being. A focus on well-being involves no longer relying on psychological solutions to solve societal problems. Instead, education leaders must look to the root causes that underlie student distress and seek to address those issues. They propose three places to start: (1) promoting a prosperity agenda, (2) encouraging ethnical technology use, and (3) embracing the restorative power of nature. Further, instead of teaching students to tamp down negative emotions, schools should empower them to marshal those emotions to bring about needed change in these areas and thus promote their own well-being.

  Abstract
                  <p>This article presents the results of a small-scale, comparative study on the perceived impact that having students enter Mathematics competitions has on Mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico, Switzerland and the UK and on their classroom practice. The study surveyed a small number of Mathematics teachers in the three countries who teach in both public and private schools and in both rural and urban regions. The perceived advantages and disadvantages to students from taking part in competitions and to teachers who have students taking part in competitions are discussed and the findings compared across the three countries. The effect that Mathematics competitions have on the identification and development of the mathematical talent of students is considered together with the contribution of these activities to the academic environment of the classroom. For the teachers who did have students taking Mathematics competitions, the limitations of entry and the different methods in which teachers prepare or assist students to prepare for the competitions are compared between countries. Since the study is small in scale, no firm conclusions are drawn but suggestions are made as to where future, larger scale, studies might be carried out to see if the classroom experiences of all could be positively influenced by exposure to Mathematics competitions.</p>
