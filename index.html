  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 37-42, May 2022. <br>Preparing students for postsecondary life is among the most important roles that a high school plays. And yet, how schools approach this work, what schools should be preparing students for, and who should be responsible for this work have long been contested. Jeremy Greenfield draws on an emerging body of psychological literature exploring purpose and offers a new way to conceive of postsecondary preparation. Rather than focusing solely on college or career preparation, high schools ought to support students to identify their interests and build an emergent set of long term goals as part of purpose-first model of postsecondary support.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 14-19, May 2022. <br>Recent stories raising the alarm about students’ poor reading skills and calling for greater attention to the “science of reading” represent the latest round in the ongoing “reading wars.” Going back at least as far as the 1950s, scholars, pundits and policy makers have debated which teaching strategies are most successful at helping students become proficient readers. However, Leah Durán and Michiko Hikida argue that these debates fail to get at the root issues behind students’ poor reading performance. Even when schools with the lowest reading scores implement science-backed pedagogical approaches, these shifts do not make up for structural inequalities in facilities, resources, and teacher quality. Reading scores reflect problems rooted in class and race inequalities that cannot be resolved through pedagogy alone.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 20-24, May 2022. <br>To make progress in improving students’ reading comprehension, we need to rethink the very nature of reading comprehension — it’s not a skill and it requires background knowledge. James Kim and Mary Burkhauser explain that, to help students apply what they learn from one reading task to another reading task, educators should consider developing thematic lessons that organize knowledge around a schema, help students connect new knowledge to a schema, and measure students’ ability to transfer knowledge to novel comprehension tasks. They encourage educators to consider how they might use their knowledge of the role of schemas in reading comprehension to improve children’s ability to read for understanding.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 25-31, May 2022. <br>Children’s development as readers is a complex and multifaceted process. Rather than emphasizing individual components of reading instruction, Melanie R. Kuhn and Katherine A. Dougherty Stahl argue that it is more effective to view the reading process as a reciprocal or interactive one in which readers’ development in one component of reading can support their growth in other components. Further, while some components need to be consistently emphasized (i.e., vocabulary, comprehension) across readers’ developmental path, others should be focused on at specific developmental moments (e.g., alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness). The authors present a general overview of how readers develop and discuss how to flexibly design instruction to meet students’ needs, enhance student learning, and better ensure all students become skilled readers.

The science of reading is a broad body of research, she explains, that includes not just alphabetics, phonics, and word reading, which receive the most attention in the media. Actual science of reading research also incorporates findings related to motivation, dyslexia, digital texts, and multilingualism. In addition, effective reading instruction does not follow a simple prescription but leaves room for teacher discretion.

Teresa Preston chronicles the history of the reading wars as they played out in Kappan. Researchers and scholars have debated the merits of phonics, wholeword, and whole-language approaches to reading, as well as the nature of research and instruction in general. But some have wondered how valuable the debate is to educators looking for guidance to help the children in their districts and schools.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 8-13, May 2022. <br>Much of the attention given to literacy, of late, has focused on ensuring that students can read, without consideration to what they are given to read. Kristin Conradi Smith &amp; Elfrieda H. Hiebert discuss four general aspects of the texts used in elementary classrooms – text complexity, text type (narrative versus informational), text format (paper versus screen), and diversity of people presented in the text. They review recent research on each of these text characteristics and then make suggestions for how to apply the research in the classroom.

Robert Kim discusses the precedents behind such third-party enforcement and considers whether educators’ fears of rampant litigation are overblown.

Tips for such conversations are helpful, but a more robust, research-based framework is needed. Rolland’s framework for rich talk suggests that conversations be adaptive, back-and-forth, and child-driven. Rick talk expands on children’s utterances, explores their thoughts and questions, and evaluates. Teachers can also benefit from conversations among themselves that use these strategies.

Jessica Minahan and Stuart Ablon combine their expertise as a behavior analyst and a psychologist to outline how best to support students whose anxiety leads to challenging behavior. They describe the role of anxiety in challenging behavior and introduce skill-building approaches that help students develop the skills they need to succeed. These approaches can help teachers analyze skill deficits in students with anxiety, identify strategies to prevent anxiety from escalating, and build skills by combining opportunities to practice problem solving with specific strategies to manage anxiety.

  Abstract
                    <p>Kyouzaikenkyuu (translated as instructional materials research) is said to be a crucial part of successful Japanese lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu is described as the planning portion of the research lesson during lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu is also said to be done on a daily basis by Japanese teachers; however, there is very little written about this process in the literature. This study takes an in-depth look into what Japanese junior high mathematics teachers do during their daily kyouzaikenkyuu, and why they do it. Through interviews, observations, and participation in kyouzaikenkyuu, we explain the process and key ideas that many Japanese mathematics teachers go through to prepare their lessons. We document two different approaches to kyouzaikenkyuu. We also found that for some teachers there is a large difference between what they do during kyouzaikenkyuu for a research lesson compared to the kyouzaikenkyuu of a daily lesson. If teachers outside of Japan wish to engage in kyouzaikenkyuu and lesson study, these approaches are a good place to start.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Instruments designed to measure teachers’ knowledge for teaching mathematics have been widely used to evaluate the impact of professional development and to investigate the role of teachers’ knowledge in teaching and student learning. These instruments assess a mixture of content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. However, little attention has been given to the content alignment between such instruments and curricular standards, particularly in regard to how content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge items are distributed across mathematical topics. This article provides content maps for two widely used teacher assessment instruments in the USA relative to the widely adopted Common Core State Standards. This common reference enables comparisons of content alignment both between the instruments and between parallel forms within each instrument. The findings indicate that only a small number of items on both instruments are designed to capture teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge and that the majority of these items are focused on curricular topics in the later grades rather than in the early grades. Furthermore, some forms designed for use as pre- and post-assessment of professional development or teacher education are not parallel in terms of curricular topics, so estimates of teachers’ knowledge growth based on these forms may not mean what users assume. The implications of these findings for teacher educators and researchers who use teacher knowledge instruments are discussed.</p>
