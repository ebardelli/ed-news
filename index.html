  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unanticipated, near-universal shift from in-person to virtual instruction in the spring of 2020. During the 2020–21 school year, schools began to reopen, and families were faced with decisions regarding the instructional mode for their children. We leverage administrative, survey, and virtual-learning data to examine the determinants of family learning-mode choice and associations between virtual education, student engagement, and academic achievement. Family preference for virtual (versus face-to-face) instruction was highly associated with subsequent school-level infection rates and appeared relatively uniform within schools. We find that students assigned to a higher proportion of instructional days in virtual mode experienced higher rates of attendance but negative achievement growth compared to students who were assigned a higher proportion of instructional days in face-to-face mode. Insights from this study can be used to better understand family preferences as well as to target and refine virtual learning in a post-COVID-19 society.

These tests allow for one or two structural breaks in deterministic components of the series and can be seen as panel-data counterparts of the tests by Zivot and Andrews (1992, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 10: 251–270) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997, Review of Economics and Statistics 79: 212–218). The dates of the breaks can be known or unknown. The tests allow for intercepts and linear trends, nonnormal errors, and cross-section heteroskedasticity and dependence. They have power against homogeneous and heterogeneous alternatives and can be applied to panels with small or large time-series dimensions.

After reviewing the method, we examine the finite-sample performance of the command using simulated data. We also illustrate the command with the National Longitudinal Survey Original Cohorts: Older Men, whose personal interviews took place in the unequally spaced years of 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1981, and 1990. The methods underlying xtusreg are those discussed by Sasaki and Xin (2017, Journal of Econometrics 196: 320–330).

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 3, Page 469-495, September 2022. <br>We discuss the ivcrc command, which implements an instrumental-variables (IV) estimator for the linear correlated random-coefficients model. The correlated random-coefficients model is a natural generalization of the standard linear IV model that allows for endogenous, multivalued treatments and unobserved heterogeneity in treatment effects. The estimator implemented by ivcrc uses recent semiparametric identification results that allow for flexible functional forms and permit instruments that may be binary, discrete, or continuous. The ivcrc command also allows for the estimation of varying-coefficient regressions, which are closely related in structure to the proposed IV estimator. We illustrate the use of ivcrc by estimating the returns to education in the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 3, Page 597-624, September 2022. <br>Typical censoring models have mass points at the upper or lower tails, or at both tails, of an otherwise continuous outcome distribution. In contrast, we consider a censoring model with a mass point in the interior of the outcome distribution. We refer to this mass point as “bunching” and use it to estimate model parameters. For example, economic theory suggests that, for increasing marginal income tax rates, many taxpayers will report income exactly at the threshold where the tax rate increases. This translates into a censoring model with bunching at the threshold. The size of this mass point of taxpayers can be used to estimate an elasticity parameter that summarizes taxpayers’ responses to taxes. In this article, we introduce the command bunching, which implements new nonparametric and semiparametric identification methods for estimating elasticities developed by Bertanha, McCallum, and Seegert (2021, Technical Report 2021-002, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). These methods rely on weaker assumptions than what are currently made in the literature and result in meaningfully different estimates of the elasticity.

When one fits flexible parametric survival models on the log-hazard scale, numerical integration is required in the log likelihood to fit the model. The use of numerical integration allows incorporation of arbitrary functions of time into the model and hence lends itself to the inclusion of multiple timescales in an appealing way. We describe and exemplify these methods and show how to use the command stmt , which implements these methods, alongside its postestimation commands.

The method uses a nonparametric retransformation of the error term and accounts for any scaling of the dependent variable. The inverse hyperbolic sine function is not invariant to scaling, which is known to shift marginal effects between those from an untransformed dependent variable to those of a logtransformed dependent variable, when all observations are positive.

In this article, we present the command dseg, which obtains all of them. It contributes to the stock of segregation commands in Stata by 1) implementing the decomposition in a single call, 2) providing the weights and local indices used in the computation of the within term, 3) facilitating the deployment of the decomposability properties of the eight indices in complex scenarios that demand tailor-made solutions, and 4) leveraging sample data with bootstrapping and approximate randomization tests. We analyze 2017 census data of public schools in the United States to illustrate the use of dseg. The subject topic is school racial segregation.

Moreover, xtsfkk uses Mata’s moptimize() functions for substantially faster execution and completion speeds. I also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations and examples demonstrating the performance and usage of xtsfkk.

We introduce a new command, swopit, that fits a mixture of ordered probit models with exogenous or endogenous switching between two latent classes (regimes). Switching is endogenous if unobservables in the classassignment model are correlated with unobservables in the outcome models. We provide a battery of postestimation commands; assess via Monte Carlo experiments the finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters, probabilities, and their standard errors (both the asymptotic and bootstrap ones); and apply the new command to model the monetary policy interest rates.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 3, Page 625-642, September 2022. <br>In modern multivariate statistics, where high-dimensional datasets are ubiquitous, learning large (inverse-) covariance matrices is imperative for data analysis. A popular approach to estimating a large inverse-covariance matrix is to regularize the Gaussian log-likelihood function by imposing a convex penalty function. In a seminal article, Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2008, Biostatistics 9: 432–441) proposed a graphical lasso (Glasso) algorithm to efficiently estimate sparse inverse-covariance matrices from the convex regularized log-likelihood function. In this article, I first explore the Glasso algorithm and then introduce a new graphiclasso command for the large inverse-covariance matrix estimation. Moreover, I provide a useful command for tuning parameter selection in the Glasso algorithm using the extended Bayesian information criterion, the Akaike information criterion, and cross-validation. I demonstrate the use of Glasso using simulation results and real-world data analysis.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To model growth over time, statistical techniques are available in both structural equation modeling (SEM) and random effects modeling frameworks. Liu et al. proposed a transformation and an inverse transformation for the linear–linear piecewise growth model with an unknown random knot, an intrinsically nonlinear function, in the SEM framework. This method allowed for the incorporation of time-invariant covariates. While the proposed method made novel contributions in this area of research, the use of transformations introduces some challenges to model estimation and dissemination. This commentary aims to illustrate the significant contributions of the authors’ proposed method in the SEM framework, along with presenting the challenges involved in implementing this method and opportunities available in an alternative framework.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined Oregon’s early intervention (EI) and early childhood special education (ECSE) pipelines as a function of children’s intersecting ethnicity and home language(s) with a focus on children from Latino/a backgrounds with communication disorders. We found differences in children’s referral source and age of referral, likelihood of evaluation and placement, and type of placement for conditions related to communication, including autism spectrum disorder and hearing impairment. Results showed differences in EI and ECSE; however, disproportionality appeared greatest among Spanish-speaking Latino/a children and non-Latino/a children who spoke languages other than English compared to non-Latino/a English-speaking counterparts. Our findings suggest that attending to children’s intersecting ethnicity and language backgrounds in referral, evaluation, and placement add nuance to examinations of disproportionality. Results also indicate that practices related to characterizing children’s communication disorders likely make substantial contributions to inequities in EI and ECSE. Precise identification of differences in service provision can lead to targeted policy and practice solutions to reduce structural barriers to care in EI/ECSE systems and improve equity, particularly as related to placement for children of color with communication concerns.

This study uses interview data to compare the planning practices of four early career teachers (ECTs) who consistently rated highly on an observational measure of high-quality mathematics instruction with those of three ECTs who consistently rated lower. ECTs who scored highly addressed planning challenges in interconnected ways that were responsive to students’ needs, demonstrated more agency in representing mathematics content in their planning, and were more likely to maintain curricular rigor when differentiating. We consider implications for efforts to help ECTs plan lessons that are likely to result in high-quality instruction.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The renewable energy consumption plays a significant role in achieving sustainable development, but a sectoral approach is necessary to design the better recommendations for each sector. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to assess the impact of the use of this type of energy on economic growth in 23 European Union (EU) member states in the period 1990–2020. Besides overall renewable energy consumption, different utilisations of this energy are considered: in industry, transport, in commercial and public services, and for residential purposes. The methodological background is built around panel data models that start from a Cobb–Douglas function. The renewable energy consumption is considered an important factor that should generate economic growth. The panel data approach based on causality analysis and Augmented Mean Group and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group estimators suggests that renewable energy use in industry does not determine economic growth, but economic development is a cause for more utilisation of this energy in industry. In addition, more renewable energy consumption in transport enhances economic growth. A high level of economic development can promote the consumption of renewable energies in industrial sectors. In this way, industrial companies can allocate more financial funds to research in the field of renewable energies and can afford to adopt renewable energy sources. Investment in biofuels can contribute to achieving sustainable transport in the EU.

Three simulation studies with simulated and real item banks were conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the joint estimation algorithm (JEA) and the single-item estimation (SIE) methods. The results indicated that the proposed Gini-based online calibration method yielded higher calibration efficiency than those of the SIE method and outperformed the JEA method on item calibration tasks in terms of both accuracy and efficiency under most experimental conditions.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Recognizing the need for scientific fidelity and balanced representation in the evidence that informs public policy, this study investigates technical and issue bias in 43 policy briefs and state handbooks that provided information about the use of Student Learning Objectives to evaluate teachers’ performance. The author uses multiple qualitative methods to categorize the contributors to the focal documents, identify the evidence they drew upon, and determine how they represented the information to their targeted audiences. The study reinforces the findings of prior research by documenting the outsized impact of advocacy groups in a policy-related evidence base. The results make an important addition to the scholarly literature by cataloging an array of technical assistance providers that translated and disseminated evidence to decision makers and spotlighting the various ways biased information appeared in the publications. Throughout, the study reinforces how incentives and timing shape evidence production and use in policymaking.
