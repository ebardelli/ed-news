          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 18-23, March 2023. <br>Over the past year, debates over the prevalence, distribution, and effects of teacher vacancy and underqualification have dominated many education narratives. Authors J. Cameron Anglum, Andrew R. Diemer, Walter G. Ecton, and Tuan D. Nguyen consider these debates in the context of growing interest in career and technical education (CTE) in high school settings. Research on secondary CTE teachers, including the quantification of teacher shortages in specific CTE content areas, remains insufficient to inform effective recruitment and retention policies. This dearth of scholarship on CTE teachers undermines the improvement of CTE programs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 24-28, March 2023. <br>A majority of students in career and technical education teacher academies indicate that they do not want to be educators. Recognizing this, Skyline High School propelled its teacher academy program in a new direction and redesigned it in a way that is mutually beneficial to the teacher academy students, preK-12 learners, and the education workforce. R. Lennon Audrain and Gregory Mendez recount how, working in close partnership with its district human resources department and Arizona State University, Skyline’s teacher academy students develop pedagogical content knowledge about the science of reading, apply it tutoring experiences at a local elementary school, and earn industry credentials that signal specialized knowledge and skills.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 29-33, March 2023. <br>Career exploration traditionally starts in middle school. However, there are advantages to starting discussions about career and preference in the early grades. California’s Cajon Valley Union School District is using the World of Work curriculum systemically from kindergarten to high school. Children learn about their personality types, do activities related to professions, and hear from professionals. Ed Hidalgo, who developed the curriculum and helped put it into practice at Cajon Valley, talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the advantages of starting in the early grades, as well as the importance of encourage students to understand and explore their strengths and preferences.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 34-39, March 2023. <br>Those asked to make valid decisions with data don’t have the technical knowledge to understand nuance around data quality, assessment aims, and statistical limitations that influence how they should interpret the data. This reality is what Greg Thompson, Leslie Rutkowski, and David Rutkowski call the validity paradox. Educators can surmount this paradox by following a five-step model in which they make a claim, make the opposite claim, and then determine how well both claims are supported by the available evidence. This process can enable practicing educators to make more valid decisions based on data.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 40-43, March 2023. <br>School leaders juggle the often-inconsistent goals of maintaining support of middle- and upper-income families for public education and, at the same time, implementing policies to strengthen equity for low-income students. Author Iris C. Rotberg describes how these tradeoffs play out in different communities, the role of concentrated poverty and segregation, and potential options for making equity gains while maintaining widespread support for public education.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 6-11, March 2023. <br>Policy makers have taken more interest in career and technical education (CTE) in recent years, but evidence regarding what kinds of programs produce the most important outcomes is still emerging. Shaun M. Dougherty summarizes what recent research tells us about the impact of these programs. Evidence has shown that CTE-dedicated schools, career academies, and programs linked to workforce needs can improve high school graduation rates and workforce earnings, but research is still emerging on how well CTE programs prepare students for postsecondary education. Most of the recent research has not focused on equity in CTE programs, and educators must remain vigilant to ensure equitable access and outcomes.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 12-17, March 2023. <br>Industry-recognized certifications (IRCs) are designed by businesses, industrial groups, and state agencies to enable students to demonstrate their skills related to a specific profession and to enable industries to know whether potential employees are qualified for specific jobs. To understand the value of these certifications, Matt Giani analyzed data from more than a million Texas public high school graduates. The data showed some positive relationships between IRCs and students’ future earnings and college enrollment and persistence, but the links are sometimes weak and vary depending on the IRC earned. And most students earning an IRC did not move on to work or postsecondary study in areas aligned with their credentials.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 54-55, March 2023. <br>Events of recent years have led many students and parents alike to question why schools work the way that they do. Students have asked why they should have to come to class when they can do the work at home. Community members have questioned why students are having to learn about contentious issues. While not all of questions are equally valid, education leaders have a responsibility to provide some kind of answer. Joshua P. Starr suggests that the answer comes down to ensuring that the value proposition for schools is clear. And in this new era, the development of community may be among the most important value propositions for public schools.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 56-57, March 2023. <br>The forces against school integration are relentless. Societal and marketplace decisions create segregated schools even in racially integrated areas in the suburbs. Jonathan E. Collins suggests creating a federal designation for public schools called the Black-serving institution (BSI), similar to historically Black colleges and universities. Schools that serve a majority Black student population would receive incentives that would help the school, students, staff, and the community. The BSI is a strategic initiative for supporting the schools full of Black students that white middle class parents actively work to keep their children from attending.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 58-60, March 2023. <br>Career and technical education (also known as vocational education) has been in existence since at least the 19th century as a means of preparing students for employment. However, for much of the 20th century, it also has served to segregate students, even after such segregation was deemed illegal. Robert Kim describes the legal history of career and technical education (CTE). Although many of today’s CTE programs show positive outcomes for students of historically marginalized backgrounds, policy makers and education leaders must understand how CTE programs differ across communities and be prepared to apply new understandings of equity to these programs.

A principal has noticed that students are only hanging out with kids from their own social class, creating a “haves” and “have nots” culture at the school.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 64-65, March 2023. <br>Equity initiatives and critical race theory (CRT) have recently emerged as an urgent agenda for K-12 schools. Jung-ah Choi argues that CRT is a useful framework but that teaching CRT principles to young children may have deleterious effects. In particular, it could undermine two bedrock notions: educational equality and meritocracy. It is not children but adults (specifically, educators) who need to focus on how racism has shaped school policies, curricula, instructional methods, and day-to-day interactions.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 6, Page 44-49, March 2023. <br>Florida’s Broward County Public Schools and the University of Chicago engaged in a Research-Practice Partnership (RPP) to scale teacher practices that support students’ critical thinking. As part of the RPP, Jeanne Century’s research team conducted research to determine what barriers might limit the spread of these practices. The findings show that teacher biases about students’ ability to engage in critical thinking, as well as their self-efficacy, might limit the extent to which teachers are willing to change their practices. Because teacher perceptions have been linked to students’ race, gender, and socioeconomic status, these perceptions may have consequences for efforts to promote equity. To improve teacher perceptions, districts can change their messaging about student abilities, boost teacher self-efficacy, and directly address teacher perceptions.

However, Latinx scholars have proposed a series of asset-based frameworks to reframe and reshape how we see and treat Latinx students in the U.S. system. Using the Dora the Explorer’s mochila (backpack) as a metaphor to capture the assets Latinx students bring to the classroom, Louie Rodriguez proposes that teachers think of Latinx students as carrying mochilas of excellence into the classroom. This framing encourages educators to recognize and develop Latinx student agency and help them realize the power and promise of education in their lives.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Examinees with item preknowledge tend to obtain inflated test scores that undermine test score validity. With the availability of process data collected in computer-based assessments, the research on detecting item preknowledge has progressed on using both item scores and response times. Item revisit patterns of examinees can also be utilized as an additional source of information. This study proposes a new statistic for detecting item preknowledge when compromised items are known by utilizing the hierarchical speed–accuracy revisits model. By simultaneously evaluating abnormal changes in the latent abilities, speeds, and revisit propensities of examinees, the procedure was found to provide greater statistical power and stronger substantive evidence that an examinee had indeed benefited from item preknowledge.

                  <p>This study foregrounds three students who are regarded by their teachers as being in special educational needs in mathematics (SEM) and these same students voicing what inclusion in mathematics education means to them. In this study, inclusion is defined as processes of participation. Discourse analysis was applied when analysing these students’ voices of inclusion in mathematics education in two inclusive mathematics classrooms, with both classes aiming to include every student in the mathematics education. The three main Discourses which were identified were the Discourse of assessment, the Discourse of being in a mathematics classroom setting, and the Discourse of accessibility in mathematics education. The analysis of the Discourses indicates that they were affected by wider sociopolitical discourses. Furthermore, when inclusion is regarded as processes of participation in mathematics education, the results indicate that participation becomes more complex. Therefore, in this process, both ideological and societal issues, as well as individual and subject-specific issues, must be considered in the educational endeavour.</p>
