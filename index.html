  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Educators in economically and racially segregated schools enact subgroup entitlement policies, such as Title III and IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), as they negotiate the diverse and underserved needs throughout the student body. How do subgroup entitlement policies for English learners and students with disabilities shape daily opportunity provision—the day-to-day distribution of resources—in segregated schools? This ethnographic study of a public middle school reveals that the implementation of subgroup entitlement policies shaped the opportunity structure for all students through (1) creating tracks that offered distinct conditions for learning, (2) fragmenting the organizational structure and inhibiting coordination, (3) exposing the school to increased compliance pressure that hierarchized priorities, and (4) utilizing subgroup-specific resources for general education students.

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of this article is to carry out a work of networking theories which combines two perspectives on the mathematical activity involved in a modelling process, in order to answer the following question: To what extent does the application of the onto-semiotic tools complement the analysis from a cognitive perspective of a mathematical modelling process? To this end, we considered two theoretical frameworks: on the one hand, the onto-semiotic approach, which provides tools for the analysis of any mathematical activity and which here we applied to the activity of modelling; on the other hand, the modelling cycle from a cognitive perspective, which is a reflection on the specific mathematical activity of modelling. Then, we took a modelling problem that we applied to prospective mathematics teachers (at undergraduate and postgraduate level), and we analysed it from the perspective of both frameworks, in order to identify concordances and complementarities between these two ways of analysing the mathematical activity involved in the modelling process. The main conclusion is that both frameworks complement each other for a more detailed analysis of the mathematical activity that underlies the modelling process. Specifically, the analysis with the tools provided by the onto-semiotic approach reveals the phases or transitions of the modelling cycle as a conglomerate of mathematical practices, processes, and the primary objects activated in these practices.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>A compelling demonstration of implicit learning is the human ability to unconsciously detect and internalize statistical patterns of complex environmental input. This ability, called statistical learning, has been investigated in people with dyslexia using various tasks in different orthographies. However, conclusions regarding impaired or intact statistical learning in dyslexia remain mixed. This study conducted a systematic literature search of published and unpublished studies that compared statistical learning between people with and without dyslexia using different learning paradigms in different orthographies. We identified 49 papers consisting of 59 empirical studies, representing the data from 1,259 participants with dyslexia and 1,459 typically developing controls. The results showed that, on average, individuals with dyslexia performed worse in statistical learning than age-matched controls, regardless of the learning paradigm or orthography (average weighted effect size d = 0.47, 95% confidence interval [0.36, 0.59], p &lt; .001). Meta-regression analyses further revealed that the heterogeneity of effect sizes between studies was significantly explained by one reader characteristic (i.e., verbal IQ) but no task characteristics (i.e., task paradigm, task modality, and stimulus type). These findings suggest domain-general statistical learning weakness in dyslexia across languages, and support the need for a new theoretical model of statistical learning and reading, that is, the SLR model, which elucidates how reader and task characteristics are regulated by a multicomponent memory system when establishing statistically optimal representations for deep learning and reading.

In this text, some reflections are provided on what this resistance might tell the science education community about the impact the field has had on individual persons specifically and society as a whole. It is suggested that we ought to think about science learning for life following formal education, and some features are described that make science in the classroom more relevant to students.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Studies consistently show associations between school absences and academic achievement. However, questions remain about whether this link depends on the reason for children’s absence. Using a sample of the Scottish Longitudinal Study (n = 4,419), we investigated whether the association between school absenteeism and achievement in high-stakes exams at the end of compulsory and postcompulsory schooling varies with the reason for absence. In line with previous research, our findings show that overall absences are negatively associated with academic achievement at both school stages. Likewise, all forms of absences (truancy, sickness absence, exceptional domestic circumstances, and family holidays) are negatively associated with achievement at the end of compulsory and postcompulsory schooling. First difference regressions confirm these negative associations, except for family holidays. These findings suggest that, in addition to lost instruction, other mechanisms such as behavioral, health-related, and psychosocial pathways may account for the association between absenteeism and achievement. The findings have implications for designing tailored absenteeism interventions to improve pupils’ academic achievement.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This study utilizes life history methodology to understand how White teachers develop racial awareness while also exploring how the education profession acts as an inflection point for racialized understandings of the world. Furthermore, as the educators in this study grew in their racial awareness, there was a rise in conflicting and ambivalent feelings as they attempted to teach in ways that aligned with their newly developed awareness. These feelings surfaced as the educators grappled with issues of race, Whiteness, and systemic inequality in both their profession and in their personal lives. Using a framework of Critical Whiteness Studies, this study provides a nuanced and contextual discussion of White identity development. Ultimately, findings show that educators begin to understand race through proximity, exposure, and repeated interaction with students of Color. This holds major implications not only for educators and teacher education programs but also for students of Color.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ preference to remain close to where they grew up is recognized as a defining feature of the teacher labor market. Using a unique data set from a large school district in the southeastern United States, I apply a series of within–school and within–student comparisons to assess the effectiveness of homegrown teachers who returned to teach in their home district. Discrete time survival analysis is then used to examine differences in when early career teachers exit the district. Study results show that homegrown teachers make small but statistically meaningful improvements in student achievement in English language arts. They are also more likely to identify as Black compared with other beginning teachers and less likely to exit the district.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Responding to the identified need for reflection, critique, and evaluations of appreciative inquiry (AI), a form of action research, this article presents a critical reflection on an application of AI in a cross-cultural music education research project. AI was selected as it appeared to both have potential for addressing the complexities related to power imbalances, ethnocentrism, and coloniality inherent in a project aiming to co-develop music teacher education in Finland and Nepal, and because its 4D model supported the co-constructing of visions, which was central to the project. The critical reflection presented in this article focused on three situations of breakdown that occurred during the research process. Analysis of these breakdowns highlighted the need for researchers to engage responsibly in research as participants, account for dreaming as an unevenly distributed capacity when working with visions or aspirations, and develop skills facilitating collaborative spaces that cultivate listening for and appreciating difference. The article concludes by recognising the limitations of undertaking this reflection independently rather than collaboratively and by cautioning against the instrumentalization of appreciation, calling instead for sincere appreciation. Overall, the article contends that the process of identifying and generating new understandings of breakdowns is a powerful approach for stimulating researcher reflexivity.

All three EL groups had lower test scores than never-ELs throughout K-4. In math, ELs grew more than never-ELs during academic years but lost more during summers. In reading, ELs grew less than never-ELs in K-1 and grew more in later grades, but ELs also lost more during summers. These findings suggest summer support is required to help ELs maintain and develop academic skills.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The majority of community college entrants aspire to earn a bachelor’s degree; yet fewer than a third do. States use several strategies to support community college’s transfer function, including a transferrable core curriculum, a block of pre-major coursework universally accepted at public postsecondary institutions. In this study, we used statewide administrative data from Texas—a state with a transferable core—to examine pre-transfer credit accumulation and how pre-transfer core credits predict bachelor’s degree attainment and time to degree for community college transfer students. Our results illuminate high variation in pre-transfer core credit accumulation among community college transfer students. Each additional pre-transfer core credit improves students’ probability of earning a bachelor’s degree, but only up to core completion status. Soon after students are core complete—at which point universities are no longer required to transfer in additional core credits, students experience a negative relationship between core credits and bachelor’s degree attainment.
