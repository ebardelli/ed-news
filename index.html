  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of research has identified teacher residency’s potentials for improving and sustaining preservice teacher learning through a stronger district–university partnership. Drawing on sensemaking perspectives on education policy implementation, this qualitative case study examines how a variety of university and district stakeholders make sense of and implement a state-mandated teacher residency in Louisiana. Findings reveal that stakeholders are primarily making sense of the residency in isolation, leading to incoherent understandings and varied implementation practices. Opportunities to improve stakeholders’ collective sensemaking and collaborative implementation and to optimize the benefits and potentials of teacher residency partnerships are discussed. This study has implications for teacher education policy implementation and continuous inquiry into the complexities of teacher preparation.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This research study focuses on how the racialized experiences of second-generation Puerto Rican student activists in Chicago during the social movement era increased their political identity to demand structural changes in secondary and college contexts. Drawing from over a dozen interviews and 100 source materials, this research uncovers the relationship between racialization, political consciousness, and community-engaged student activism. The study concludes by highlighting lessons learned and implications for practice.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Florida Senate Bill 1720 drastically changed developmental education, beginning in fall 2014. This paper considers affected faculty members’ perceptions and experiences with the passage and implementation of reform, according to focus group data provided by 294 participants at 21 Florida College System institutions between 2014 and 2019. We found that faculty members experienced feelings of powerlessness and meaninglessness—the two main components of policy alienation—related to the passage of SB 1720, with some reported opportunities for discretion and innovation at a local level. Despite feelings of alienation, faculty worked hard to facilitate student success through the changes.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>What are the effects of teaching the dominant mathematics on the wholeness and integrity of the cultural, social and linguistic resources of diverse communities? In this text, I seek to capture the risks associated with utilising non-Western resources in the teaching of the dominant mathematics in order to elucidate possible types of harms that conventional mathematics education could cause to various non-Western communities. In particular, I challenge various dominant theoretical views that endorse the employment of the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of others to teach and learn mathematics, without paying similar or even deeper ethical attention to the mutual and reciprocal effects of the taught and learnt mathematics. I propose an epistemology of interrelationships; I call attention to possible harms caused by utilising the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of some non-Western communities as part of the teaching and learning of dominant school mathematics on the same (re)sources of those communities.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes the difficulties faced by a group of middle school students (13- to 15-year-olds) attempting to translate algebraic statements written in verbal language into symbolic language and vice versa. The data used were drawn from their replies to a written quiz and semi-structured interviews. In the former, students were confronted with a series of algebraic statements and asked to choose the sole translation, of four proposed for each, that was semantically congruent with the original. The results show that most of the errors detected were due to arithmetic issues, especially around the distinction between product and exponent or sum and product in connection with the notions of perimeter and area. As a rule, the error distribution by type varied depending on the type of task involved.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The article focuses on rehearsals as part of a practice-based approach to professional development. Fourteen Norwegian elementary in-service teachers (ISTs) collaborate in learning cycles of enactment and investigation, where the overarching aim is to learn to enact the practices that constitute ambitious mathematics teaching. Rehearsals are an important part of these cycles. We examine the patterns of use of teacher time outs (TTOs) in rehearsals and how TTOs enable the ISTs to learn core practices of ambitious teaching. The findings reveal that approximately 60% of the time in rehearsals is spent on ISTs’ teaching and 40% on TTOs. The TTOs enable the ISTs to learn together the practices of using representations, aiming towards goals, launching problems, organising the board and facilitating student talk. The findings reveal that the participants were able to work simultaneously on multiple practices, and a recurrent theme in the TTOs is representing students’ ideas as accurately as possible whilst simultaneously considering the mathematical correctness of the representations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The successful use of lesson plans as the primary vehicle for storing and sharing teachers’ instructional knowledge in Japan has given impetus to calls by US researchers for the development of a system for sharing teachers’ knowledge through instructional products to improve teachers’ capacity to implement high-quality instruction and to build a knowledge base for instruction. These products would be created by, and for, teachers to use in guiding instruction, thus building and sharing teachers’ instructional knowledge. In this study, we try to characterize one aspect of teacher knowledge that is central in building a knowledge base for instruction, knowledge of student mathematical thinking. We analyze ten written instructional products from the USA and Japan to better understand what knowledge of student mathematical thinking can be shared in such products. We also look at how knowledge of student mathematical thinking is used to guide and justify instructional decisions. One key finding is that the knowledge of student mathematical thinking shared in the top written instructional products is specific to a task or mathematical topic, varied with descriptions of multiple solutions or ways of reasoning, and sufficiently detailed to make the knowledge usable for teachers.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examines how teachers’ discourse moves influence patterns of authority in the mathematics classroom. We identify changes in authority structure in one classroom taught by a primary mathematics teacher in Hong Kong. This teacher participant was one of 32 who participated in a larger teacher-intervention study that aimed to help teachers orchestrate dialogic classroom discourse for rich learning opportunities in mathematics. Previous research has investigated teachers’ discourse behaviors and authority structures in mathematics classrooms, but the connection between the two has yet to be addressed in extant studies. Our analysis shows that certain features and patterns embedded in classroom discourse can constrain or enable certain kinds of authority in the classroom. This study contributes to understanding the ways in which dialogic discourse may influence how authority is structured, including how mathematics teaching and learning are enacted through authority styles, and how the discipline of mathematics is positioned from an authority perspective.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This multi-case study examines how three elementary mathematics methods instructors, in the same teacher education program, provide their prospective teachers with learning opportunities. Qualitative data were collected through interviews, classroom observations, and artifacts. The findings suggest that the instructors’ beliefs associated with teaching philosophies influence both the content that prospective teachers have the opportunity to learn (what) and the nature of the prospective teachers’ opportunities to learn (how). Through analytic induction, three assertions were developed to understand and explicate: similarities in opportunities to learn, differences in opportunities to learn, and perceptions about the purpose of the methods courses across the three cases. Specifically, the first assertion examines how all three methods instructors focused on developing conceptual understanding and combating mathematical misconceptions for which prospective teachers most often experience opportunities to learn through representations and approximations. The second and third assertions place more emphasis on differences across the cases based upon observed instructor actions and their beliefs. This study is significant because it helps us gain a deeper understanding about prospective teachers’ opportunities to learn within one teacher education program, and therefore, may point toward what can be done in the future to better prepare teachers in elementary mathematics education and the development of ambitious instruction. Additionally, this study unpacks how prospective teachers in the same teacher education program may have varying experiences and thus varied access to opportunities to learn.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking (Jacobs et al. in J Res Math Educ 41(2):169–202, 2010) is a construct that is used frequently to understand the ways in which teachers attend to, interpret, and respond to children’s mathematical thinking. In this paper, we present our analysis of prospective elementary mathematics teachers’ (PTs’) responses to a pedagogical activity designed to engage them in an approximation (Grossman et al. in Teach Coll Rec 111(9): 2055–2100, 2009) of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking in the moment of teaching, with a focus on developing responses which extend the student’s thinking. PTs were provided two different examples of student work and a series of questions designed to elicit information about their ability to professionally notice student work. We present data and analysis of 73 PTs’ abilities to engage in the individual skills associated with noticing as well as their abilities to use the skills cohesively in concert. Our results demonstrate the type of representation used determined PTs’ success in all three facets of noticing, with a particular effect on interpreting. Further, our focus on a specific type of response move, along with the introduction of a scaffold for that response move, made a difference in PTs’ ability to successfully respond to student work when compared to a prior study with the same PTs (Tyminski et al. 2014). We unpack these results along with suggestions for pedagogical practice as well as directions for future research.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Equity-oriented school improvement driven by neoliberal policies focuses attention on a narrow range of inequities. Such policies fail to achieve substantive transformations that address educational constraints experienced by multiply-marginalized youth of color. We engage a critical race and intersectional feminist examination of our pedagogy in a youth voice initiative designed to facilitate multiply-marginalized youth of color participation in district policy partnership. Our analysis presents practices that were consequential for supporting youth intellectual activism in policy conversations. We propose a model for critical race intersectional pedagogy that relates these practices and underlying ideological principles to supporting expansive transformative policy partnerships.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In an effort to improve learning for young children and respond to preschool fade out, some districts are working on “PreK-3” initiatives to create better connected learning pathways for children. In these pathways, primary grades continue to build on what children learn in preschool; they also present potential implementation challenges that are not accounted for in the literature. Using conceptual tools from institutional theory and empirical evidence from a study of two school districts, we show how challenges arise as districts try to bridge the divergent and entrenched institutional systems of preschool and elementary. Our findings suggest that these systems are each held in place by their own set of regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive mechanisms that reinforce one another thereby providing an explanation for why beliefs and practices are so resistant to change. This analysis also points to practical implications that may lead to better connections and learning experiences for young children.

                  <p>This is a commentary on the ESM 2021 Special Issue on Innovations in Measuring and Fostering Mathematical Modelling Competencies. We have grouped the ten studies into three themes: competencies, fostering, and measuring. The first theme and the papers therein provide a platform to discuss the cognitivist backgrounds to the different conceptualizations of mathematical modelling competencies, based on the modelling cycle. We suggest theoretical widening through a competence continuum and enriching of the modelling cycle with overarching, analytic dimensions for creativity, tool use, metacognition, and so forth. The second theme and the papers therein showcase innovative ideas on fostering and on the definition and analysis thereof. These reveal the need for a social turn in modelling research in order to capture aspects of student collaboration and agency, as well as tensions in fostering when tasks are derived from real-world scenarios, but socio-mathematical norms come from the (pure) mathematics classroom. The third theme, measuring, and the papers therein offer insights into the challenges of positivist research that aims to develop innovative measurement instruments that are both reliable and valid, particularly in light of student group work, cultural background, and other socio-cultural aspects. Drawing on the three discussions, we go on to make recommendations for further research.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of research and popular reporting shows racial differences in school modality choices during the COVID-19 crisis, with White students more likely to attend school in person in the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021. This in-person learning gap raises serious equity concerns. We use unique panel survey data to explore possible explanations. We find that a combination of factors may explain these differences. School districts’ offerings, political partisanship, perceived risk from the pandemic, and local COVID-19 outbreaks are all meaningfully associated with and plausibly explain the in-person learning racial gap. Our results illustrate how not only policy decisions but also political leanings and individuals’ beliefs could contribute to inequality in access to learning and illustrate the need for a better understanding of the factors behind observed racial inequalities in education.
