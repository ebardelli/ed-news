  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The generalized [math]–test is a test of item fit for items with polytomous responses format. The test is based on a comparison of the observed and expected number of responses in strata defined by the test score. In this article, we make four contributions. We demonstrate that the performance of the generalized [math]–test depends on how sparse cells are pooled. We propose alternative implementations of the test within the framework of limited information testing. We derive the distribution of the [math]–residuals that can be used for post hoc analyses. We suggest a diagnostic plot that visualizes the form of the misfit. The performance of the alternative implementations is investigated in a simulation study. The simulation study suggests that the alternative implementations are capable of controlling the Type-I error rate well and have high power. An empirical application concludes this article.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper uses the case of New York City teachers’ interpretations of the labels that are assigned to their performance to explore how teachers experience teacher evaluation systems. Based on our analyses of 141 interviews with New York City teachers, we argue that the ordinal performance labels assigned to teachers by New York City’s Advance teacher development and evaluation system—Highly Effective, Effective, Developing, and Ineffective—have meanings that extend beyond how they locate teachers in relation to one another, or in relation to an absolute standard of teaching performance. The labels can evoke powerful emotions in teachers, and may stymie policymakers’ hopes that they will be motivated by the labels to redouble their efforts to teach well. Teachers’ reactions to the labels can also reveal their strategies to resist the redefinition of teachers’ work.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Parents and educators commonly assume that male teachers serve as more effective disciplinarians for boys than female teachers. Do schools tend to assign male teachers to teach boys with perceived behavioral issues? Our study uses administrative data in Indiana to investigate male teacher assignment in elementary school. We find that boys with at least one suspension record in the previous year are 12% more likely to be assigned to a male teacher than boys without suspensions, whereas girls’ suspension histories do not predict assignments to male teachers. In addition, teachers who have 10% or more of students with suspension histories are 19.5% more likely to migrate to another school and 16.2% more likely to leave the state’s teacher workforce. Our study suggests that male teachers have an elevated risk of being assigned to teach male students with suspension histories, which may contribute to teacher turnover.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>IntroductionFlavored tobacco appeals to new users. This paper describes evaluation results of California’s early ordinances restricting flavored tobacco sales.MethodsA multicomponent evaluation of proximal policy outcomes involved the following: (a) tracking the reach of local ordinances; (b) a retail observation survey; and (c) a statewide opinion poll of tobacco retailers. Change in the population covered by local ordinances was computed. Retail observations compared availability of flavored tobacco at retailers in jurisdictions with and without an ordinance. Mixed models compared ordinance and matched no-ordinance jurisdictions and adjusted for store type. An opinion poll assessed retailers’ awareness and ease of compliance with local ordinances, comparing respondents in ordinance jurisdictions with the rest of California.ResultsThe proportion of Californians living in a jurisdiction with an ordinance increased from 0.6% in April 2015 to 5.82% by January 1, 2019. Flavored tobacco availability was significantly lower in ordinance jurisdictions than in matched jurisdictions: menthol cigarettes (40.6% vs. 95.0%), cigarillos/cigar wraps with explicit flavor descriptors (56.4% vs. 85.0%), and vaping products with explicit flavor descriptors (6.1% vs. 56.9%). Over half of retailers felt compliance was easy; however, retailers in ordinance jurisdictions expressed lower support for flavor sales restrictions.ConclusionsThe proportion of California’s population covered by a flavor ordinance increased nine-fold between April 2015 and January 2019. Fewer retailers in ordinance jurisdictions had flavored tobacco products available compared to matched jurisdictions without an ordinance, but many still advertised flavored products they could not sell. Comprehensive ordinances and retailer outreach may facilitate sales-restriction support and compliance.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Toward the goal of more rapid knowledge accumulation via better meta-analyses, this article explores statistical approaches intended to increase the precision and comparability of effect sizes from education research. The featured estimate of the proposed approach is a standardized mean difference effect size whose numerator is a mean difference that has been adjusted for baseline differences in the outcome measure, at a minimum, and whose denominator is the total variance. The article describes the utility and efficiency of covariate adjustment through baseline measures and the need to standardize effects on a total variance that accounts for variation at multiple levels. As computation of the total variance can be complex in multilevel studies, a shiny application is provided to assist with computation of the total variance and subsequent effect size. Examples are provided for how to interpret and input the required calculator inputs.

For example, proficiency levels are reported for the Advanced Placement (AP®) and U.S. Medical Licensing examinations. Technical difficulties and other unforeseen events occasionally lead to missing item scores and hence to incomplete data on these tests. The reporting of proficiency levels to the examinees with incomplete data requires estimation of the performance of the examinees on the missing part and essentially involves imputation of missing data. In this article, six approaches from the literature on missing data analysis are brought to bear on the problem of reporting of proficiency levels to the examinees with incomplete data. Data from several large-scale educational tests are used to compare the performances of the six approaches to the approach that is operationally used for reporting proficiency levels for these tests. A multiple imputation approach based on chained equations is shown to lead to the most accurate reporting of proficiency levels for data that were missing at random or completely at random, while the model-based approach of Holman and Glas performed the best for data that are missing not at random. Several recommendations are made on the reporting of proficiency levels to the examinees with incomplete data.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundStakeholders are often involved in evaluation, such as in the selection of specific research questions and the interpretation of results. Except for the topic of whether stakeholder involvement increases use, a paucity of research exists to guide practice regarding stakeholders.ObjectivesWe address two questions: (1) If a third-party observer knows stakeholders were involved in an evaluation, does that affect the perceived credibility, fairness, and relevance of the evaluation? (2) Among individuals with a possible stake in an evaluation, which stakeholder group(s) do they want to see participate; in particular, do they prefer that multiple stakeholder groups, rather than a single group, participate?Research DesignSix studies are reported. All studies address the former question, while Studies 3 to 5 also focus on the latter question. To study effects of stakeholder involvement on third-party views, participants read summaries of ostensible evaluations, with stakeholder involvement noted or not. To examine a priori preferences among potential stakeholders, participants completed a survey about alternative stakeholder group involvement in an evaluation in which they would likely have an interest.Results and ConclusionsAcross studies, effects of reported stakeholder participation on third-parties’ views were not robust; however, small effects on perceived fairness sometimes, but not always, occurred after stakeholder involvement and its rationales had been made salient. All surveys showed a large preference for the involvement of multiple, rather than single stakeholder groups. We discuss implications for research and practice regarding stakeholder involvement, and for research on evaluation more generally.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, I examine deficit talk, utterances that depict students and/or families based on their perceived deficits, in an equity-oriented professional development (PD) setting. Researchers often attribute deficit talk by mathematics teachers (MTs) to their biased beliefs and perceptions. From an interactional approach, namely conversation analysis and discursive psychology, I offer an alternative perspective on how deficit talk is produced in PD interactions. The analysis shows the rhetorical functions of deficit talk, which are designed for MTs to manage their accountability with a range of potential issues and to portray themselves as competent teachers. The analysis also reveals the action-performing nature of deficit talk (e.g., refusing a request) situated in the social interaction. To conclude, this paper suggests that mathematics teacher educators need to attend to the micropolitical nature of deficit talk and their co-participation in the production of deficit talk as they formulate ways to respond to deficit talk in PD interactions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Understanding children’s attitudes towards mathematics provides insights into their lived mathematical experience and engagement. Despite the considerable amount of research into students’ attitudes toward mathematics, limited research has been conducted into young children’s attitudes toward mathematics (YCATM). Within this limited research, investigating YCATM has certain challenges. From a methodological perspective, limitations exist regarding the type of research techniques that can be employed to study the nuances of the issue. The foci of this paper are to present and evaluate a methodological approach that used children’s drawings (N = 106) and interview responses as the primary sources of data. Findings indicate that the strategy of “Draw yourself doing mathematics”, when used with other research methods, generated rich attitudinal data in the form of personal stories about YCATM.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>In spring 2020, school closures were enacted to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students and teachers faced the challenge of organizing digital teaching and learning without sufficient time to prepare. In this study, we investigated how teachers implemented teaching from a distance and how these different implementations were associated with students’ and parents’ perceptions of teaching quality and students’ social involvement, enjoyment of learning, academic effort, and perceived competence. To this end, we examined data from 277 teachers, 3,159 students in Grades 5 to 10, and 1,688 parents who rated classes in mathematics, German language arts, and English as a foreign language during the school closures. The results showed that teachers’ implementations of distance teaching varied greatly. Teaching methods enabling social connectedness (e.g., video meetings, learning videos created by the teacher) revealed the most consistent positive associations with students’ and parents’ teaching quality ratings and students’ learning experiences.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, families have faced a difficult decision between online and in-person instruction. In many school districts, a higher proportion of non-White families selected online instruction for fall 2020, but the factors influencing these patterns are unclear. Using a case study approach, I focus on the experiences of 21 Latinx families whose children attend the same majority-Latinx charter school in Houston, Texas, and explore the factors families balanced when deciding between online and in-person instruction. Drawing on 37 in-depth interviews with mothers and their children, I find that Latinx families made schooling decisions informed by their shared school context, the needs of family networks, and community infection rates. Health and safety concerns drove most families to select online instruction while acknowledging it was an academic sacrifice, but maternal employment and access to child care shaped their ability to make this choice. This study highlights the influence of nonschool factors in pandemic schooling decisions.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The relationships that students have with teachers and peers are important for their academic, social, and behavioral development. How teachers relate to students may affect students’ peer relationships and thereby foster or hamper students’ development. To shed more light on the teacher’s role with respect to peer relationships, this meta-analysis assessed the association between the quality of teacher–student and peer relationships (n = 297 studies; n = 1,475 unique effect sizes). We took student behavior into account, as it is known to affect both types of relationship. In addition, design characteristics such as positive versus negative aspects of relationships, type of informants, and educational level were considered. Results showed that negative aspects of the teacher–student relationship in particular were predictive of peer relationships. Moreover, teacher–student relationship quality partially mediated the association between student behavior and peer relationships. For teachers, preventing or reducing negative aspects in their relationships with students who have behavioral problems can positively affect classroom peer relationships.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Multimedia is ubiquitous in 21st-century education. Cognitive load theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning both postulate that the quality of multimedia design heavily influences learning. We sought to identify how to best design multimedia and review how well those learning theories held up to meta-analyses. We conducted an overview of systematic reviews that tested the effects of multimedia design on learning or cognitive load. We found 29 reviews including 1,189 studies and 78,177 participants. We found 11 design principles that demonstrated significant, positive, meta-analytic effects on learning and five that significantly improved management of cognitive load. The largest benefits were for captioning second-language videos, temporal/spatial contiguity, and signaling. We also found robust evidence for modality, animation, coherence/removing seductive details, anthropomorphics, segmentation, personalization, pedagogical agents, and verbal redundancy effects. Good design was more important for more complex materials, and in system-paced environments (e.g., lectures) than self-paced ones (e.g., websites). Results supported many tenets of both theories. We highlight a range of evidence-based strategies that could be implemented by educators.

  Abstract
                  <p>Teacher self-efficacy beliefs, epistemological beliefs, and beliefs about teaching with technology are regarded as crucial factors for teaching mathematics with technology. However, there is a lack of research that investigates these beliefs while taking into account the multidimensionality of the constructs. In this cross-sectional study with n = 198 upper secondary in-service teachers in Germany, we used multidimensional scales to measure teachers’ i) beliefs about teaching with technology, ii) self-efficacy beliefs, and iii) epistemological beliefs. Furthermore, teachers were asked to self-report on their iv) implementation of technology with respect to different modes of technology use. The results uncover differential associations among the constructs and identify sub-dimensions that are especially central. In particular, three clusters of sub-dimensions can be reconstructed. One cluster reflects a broader set of sub-dimensions and is related to a more integrated and constructivist implementation of technology. In this cluster, self-efficacy can be identified as a central construct. A further cluster is related to using technology to support multiple representations which turned out to be independent of many other sub-dimensions. Finally, the third cluster comprises sub-dimension that can be interpreted as less central. This cluster in particular contains teachers’ beliefs about the detrimental effects of teaching with technology, which points out that beliefs about the risks of technology use are less central than beliefs about the potential benefits of technology. The results can inform more differentiated approaches to teacher professional development related to teaching mathematics with technology.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Researchers have noted a nonlinear association between reading instruction dosage (i.e., hours of instruction) and reading outcomes for Grade K–3 students with reading difficulties (K–3 SWRD). In this article, we propose a nonlinear meta-analysis as a method to identify both the maximum effect size and optimal dosage of reading interventions for K–3 SWRD using 26 peer-reviewed studies including 186 effect sizes. Results suggested the effect sizes followed a concave parabolic shape, such that increasing dosage improved intervention effects until 39.92 hours of instruction (dmax = 0.77), after which the intervention effects declined. Moderator analyses found that maximum intervention effects on fluency outcomes were significantly larger (dmax = 1.34) than the overall maximum effect size. Also, when students received 1:1 instruction, the dosage response curve displayed a different functional form than the concave parabolic shape, showing the effect increased indefinitely after approximately 16.8 hours of instruction. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Mental disease is increasing worldwide and people who suffer from it show lower employment rates and lower earnings. Various approaches have been tried to increase the employment rate of people with mental disease. In the US, empirical studies show that individual placement and support(IPS)—a rapid transition to the job market, with some external assistance—is effective in increasing the employment rate of the mentally ill. Europe lacks such evidence. Purpose: The study assesses the impact of an IPS-like program undertaken in Italy on the employment rate of people with severe mental illness. Methods: The analysis is based on a RCT that tests whether offering people with severe mental illness the support of a “job coach” increases their chances of being employed. Moreover, using a battery of tests—one of which is made available by the RCT itself—we show that the large non-compliance with the protocol showed by the RCT is ignorable. This motivates estimating the impact of carrying out a traineeship during the experimental period on employment using non-experimental methods. Results and Conclusions: The study finds that the availability of a coach boosts the patients’ chances of finding a traineeship during the experimental period; moreover, undertaking a traineeship almost doubles the likelihood of being at work one year later.JEL CODES: J78, J48, J38

  Abstract
                  <p>This study focuses on a lesson study adaptation for bridging prospective teachers’ experiences in a methods course and their field experiences in a teacher education program in Puerto Rico. We ask, what opportunities for teacher learning emerge during discussions in lesson study? Two lesson study teams of secondary mathematics prospective teachers, each led by an experienced mentor, planned technology-based lessons. Using the theoretical framework for lesson study by Lewis and colleagues, we analyzed video recordings of the teams’ discussions. The results show learning opportunities in the three dimensions of the framework: teachers’ knowledge and beliefs, the creation of a professional community, and the development of teaching–learning artifacts. The mentors leveraged prospective teachers’ knowledge, built on topics discussed in the methods course, and created a professional learning community. Three resources introduced in the methods course supported the creation of a hybrid space connecting academic and practitioner knowledge: shared language about teaching moves for using technology in math instruction, the mathematical proficiency framework, and a lesson plan template. The mentors drew upon their subject matter and pedagogical knowledge during their facilitation of lesson study. The intervention exemplifies a lesson study adaptation that is feasible in the context of a teacher education program.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For decades, research has shown the pervasive racism of teacher education and its harmful impact on teacher candidates of Color. In this conceptual article, we argue that teacher education programs must interrogate how racism is embedded structurally through policies and practices that guide the various facets of the institution. We build from higher education scholarship on racial climate and “health” and teacher education research on race and racism to explore how multiple dimensions of a teacher education program (historical, organizational, compositional, behavioral, and psychological) accumulate and shape the experiences and well-being of teacher candidates of Color. We offer a model to assist teacher education scholars, administrators, and practitioners to reflect upon their current structures as they strive for a healthy racial climate responsive to the experiences and needs of a diverse teaching force.
