  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>School systems are increasingly working to foster more ambitious learning environments and disrupt institutionalized educational inequities. But such efforts are complicated by a number of uncertainties—about the aims of schooling and how they might be achieved or measured—that suffuse educational organizations. Although there is general agreement that uncertainty is both pervasive and consequential in educational settings, as a field we lack a more unified analytic framework for making sense of this uncertainty. In this article, I seek to advance such a project by drawing on educational and organizational scholarship to identify three forms of uncertainty that pervade school systems. While two of these forms of uncertainty—environmental and technical—are well established in organizational theory, I develop the concept of representational uncertainty as a third form of uncertainty that is particularly impactful in schools. I show how these three forms of uncertainty manifest across different contexts, aims, and levels of school systems; how they interrelate; and how they must be strategically mitigated or fostered in the service of educational improvement.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This systematic review examined evidence of the utility of learning progression (LP)–based assessments to inform teaching and student learning in classroom contexts. Fifty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed against four research questions. Evidence highlighted their potential for supporting judgments about learning, informing instructional and learning decisions, and improving teacher learning and development. Although 23 studies measured student achievement, reporting positive overall effects, only 6 adopted the experimental designs necessary for causal claims. Using LP-based assessment for formative purposes was well supported. Limited evidence was found regarding summative and accountability uses. Findings show that LP-based assessment design and use requires trade-offs relating to standardization and scale. Teachers need opportunities for negotiation when making judgments and integrating LP-based assessments into existing curriculum and policy contexts. Future research should examine student use of LP assessments and find a balance between standardization and customization to meet the needs of diverse learners and local contexts.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The racial/ethnic disparities and average declines in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) motivation during adolescence are worrisome. Although STEM motivational beliefs are theorized to function in conjunction with one another, the unique patterns and how they change over time for different racial/ethnic groups remain understudied. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study (N = 18,260), we identified four and five patterns of math and science motivational beliefs in 9th and 11th grade, respectively, and examined their prevalence among Asian, Black, Latina/o, White, and Multiracial adolescents. We found patterns with overall high/low beliefs, patterns with varying levels of motivational beliefs, and patterns characterized by domain differentiation. Then, we charted the stability and changes in those patterns from 9th to 11th grade for each racial/ethnic group and how the patterns at 11th grade were associated with adolescents’ STEM career expectations and high school math and science grade point averages.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Students, instructors, and policy makers are in need of research-based recommendations for supporting students’ motivation to pursue STEM fields. The present study addressed this need by examining relations between perceived motivational supports, year-long trajectories of expectancy for success and three task values, and grades among students (N = 1,021) in a large, gateway engineering course. Results indicated that students with higher motivation at the beginning of the year tended to perceive their class as more motivationally supportive. Controlling for relations between initial motivation and perceptions, perceived instructional supports for mastery goals, autonomy, and competence predicted more positive trajectories of all three task values. Conversely, higher perceived instructor performance goals negatively predicted grades and the slopes of self-efficacy and interest value. Results contribute key understanding about the interconnectedness of individual motivation and climate perceptions, while indicating the importance students place on certain motivationally supportive practices in promoting students’ STEM motivation trajectories.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Computational thinking (CT) is a set of cognitive skills that every child should acquire. K–12 classrooms are expected to provide students opportunities (tasks) to think computationally. We introduce a CT competency assessment for middle school students. The assessment design process started by establishing a cognitive model of CT domain mastery, in which three broad skill types were identified to represent CT competency. After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs. The results inform an initial understanding of typical learning progressions in CT at the middle school level.

  Abstract
                  <p>Due to rapid immigration, many children worldwide are learning mathematics in a second or additional language. This language diversity can be challenging for both teachers and students and carries profound implications for mathematics educators. Research shows that teachers use various ways to support English Language Learners. Research on multilingualism in mathematics classrooms has often focused on qualitative research. This meta-analysis aims to explore the statistically effective successful teaching practices from the studies using quantitative or mixed-method research approaches and aims to inform the research field in a cumulative manner. The specific research question that guided this meta-analysis is: What is the evidence regarding successful teaching of mathematics for Year 1–10 English Language Learners from 2009–2019 in countries where curricula are delivered predominantly in English? Four successful intervention categories were identified: Dual Language Programmes, Curriculum integration, Teacher Professional Development, and Cognitively Focused Interventions. The paper concludes with recommendations for practice and further research in this area.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we describe how a teacher makes decisions during interaction with students in order to guide their focus towards the lesson’s objectives that the teacher has in mind. In particular, in the paper we examine how a mathematics teacher’s knowledge connects with the teacher’s noticing skill and interactive action. We present the case of a competent Japanese teacher, Mr. T, during a series of nine lessons on comparing fractions in a fifth-grade classroom. We first look at how Mr. T structured the lessons and interactions to help the students shift their focus from the procedural aspects to the quantitative aspects, when generating their explanations concerning how to compare fractions. Then, we analyze how Mr. T interpreted the students’ responses and made decisions about his interactive actions in the two lessons. The results show that Mr. T structured the entire lessons by repeatedly eliciting students’ ideas and focusing on the object of examination. Detailed analysis of three vignettes shows Mr. T’s constant reference to the lesson objectives when attending to and interpreting the students’ thinking both in verbal and written form. Furthermore, he strove to adjust his initial decisions according to the students’ reactions. These processes of noticing the students’ mathematical thinking were made possible by his extensive content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge; in particular, his knowledge of figural representation had a significant influence on his decision-making.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Most parents consider private supplementary tutoring (PT) as an effective means of improving academic achievement. However, previous studies on this method have produced either partial or inconclusive results on its effectiveness. Thus, in the present study we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the learning of middle school students in China, with specific focus on the final year of middle school. The analysis was based on a specially designed longitudinal survey of private supplementary tutoring in mathematics. An analysis using hierarchical linear regression showed that regular private tutoring, throughout the school years, could have a minor effect on students’ mathematical achievements by the final year of middle school. These results suggest that parents should make careful choices for their children’s private tutoring, and the government must issue comprehensive, professional guidelines to regulate the private tutoring industry. Moreover, other countries could find major take-aways from the Chinese experience of private tutoring for enhancing students’ mathematical performances.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this special issue we introduce the state of the art of empirical studies on creativity in mathematics and mathematics education. To do so we conducted a retrospective analysis of empirical studies on mathematical creativity with special attention to the studies conducted during the last decade. In the paper we present a brief survey of research on mathematical creativity up to 2009 and then a detailed review of empirical studies performed during the past decade. We note an optimistic development of attention paid to mathematical creativity in schools. A systematic search conducted to examine research on creativity in mathematics education journals and research in the field of mathematics in creativity-related journals, yielded 49 papers that described empirical studies on creativity in mathematics education. The retrospective analysis examined the following: (a) the main goals of the studies; (b) conceptual frameworks used by the researchers; (c) research methodologies; and (d) tools and tasks. Of these, 18 studies examined the relationships between creativity in mathematics and other characteristics, 25 were on creativity related to instructional practices and mathematical tasks, and 6 studies investigated teachers’ creativity-related conceptions and competencies. Of these studies, 29 used quantitative methodologies, 10 of which integrated analysis for problem solving or problem posing strategies or outcomes. Ten additional studies employed qualitative methodology (mainly content analysis of lesson observations). We conclude the paper with a short review of papers in this special issue, and outline directions for future research on creativity in mathematics (education).</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many selective colleges consider the backgrounds of applicants to improve equity in admissions. However, this information is usually not available for all applicants. We examine whether the chances of admission and enrollment changed after 43 colleges gained access to a new tool that standardizes information on educational disadvantage for all applicants. Applicants from the most challenging school and neighborhood backgrounds experienced a 5-percentage point increase in the probability of admission in the year of adoption relative to similar applicants in the previous year. The tool did not alter the probability of enrollment as a function of applicant challenge level in the full sample, but positive changes are concentrated among applicants to institutions that used the tool to allocate financial aid.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics Challenge for Young Australians is a unique enrichment program that has been produced annually by the Australian Mathematics Trust since 1991. In its present form, it is divided into four levels and caters for talented students from years 3 to 10. In a typical year, it attracts over 15,000 entries. Individual schools arrange a period of up to four weeks in the first half of the academic year for students to work on their prescribed set of the problems and write full solutions. Limited collaboration among students is permitted and encouraged. There is a strong emphasis on articulating clearly the reasoning in solutions with sound and complete presentation. A guide containing marking schemes is provided for teachers to help them assess their students' work. It also includes discussion points and extension questions, which are relevant to each problem and may be used by the teacher for further enrichment activity. This paper discusses the history, aims, and structure of the program. It describes how problems are designed by the Challenge Committee to engage the students and develop their problem-solving skills. A range of past Challenge problems are presented to illustrate their construction, diversity, levels of difficulty, and relevance to educational objectives.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to investigate seventh-grade students’ visuospatial thinking processes in an art studio environment, where students were engaged with geometrically rich artworks. The students were asked to observe minimalist artworks, then create and critique their own and others’ artworks based on the Studio Thinking Framework. Data were collected through interviews conducted with students, video recordings in the studio, and students’ documents (sketches, artworks, and notes). The data were analyzed based on previous studies on spatial thinking and emergent data. The study’s findings indicate that the Studio Thinking-based environment has the potential to elicit students’ visuospatial thinking processes, mainly in recognizing shapes, decomposing and composing shapes, patterning, and transforming shapes rigidly and non-rigidly (scaling). The present study, which includes accounts of three studio works, suggests an emergent framework for the characterization of visuospatial thinking within a particular art-math-related environment. The findings of the study shed light on other studies on visual arts and mathematics education and on mathematical thinking and learning in informal learning settings.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes an embedded case study of “blended” teaching integrated with traditional lessons in a Student-Centered Active Learning Environment and social activities on the platform. The didactic phenomena were designed by creating learning environments, artifacts, and teaching/learning sequences in authentic educational contexts. We aim at improving the task design of a mathematics lesson with an impact on students’ performance in mathematics. Quantitative results show considerable benefits in the evolution of the use and coordination of several systems of semiotic representation. As a result, a better predisposition to the study of the subject seems to appear; moreover, the satisfaction test shows the achievement of alternative teaching methodologies for most of the students.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Colleges and universities have increasingly worried in recent decades about college students’ well-being, with the COVID-19 pandemic aggravating these concerns. Our study examines changes to undergraduate emotional sentiments and psychological well-being from before to after the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we explore whether certain risk factors (i.e., prior mental health impairments, trait emotional stability) and protective factors (i.e., subjective socioeconomic status, parental education, household resources) predicted students’ emotions and their intraindividual changes due to the pandemic onset. We compared experience sampling method data from 120 students from before and after the pandemic onset, examining intraindividual trajectories. There was only little change in students’ emotions. Prior mental health impairment and trait emotional stability predicted students’ emotions, averaged across time points, but not emotion changes. Few associations with emotions were found for subjective socioeconomic status and parental education, but study-related household resources predicted levels and changes in emotions.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, a growing number of studies have applied regression discontinuity designs (RDDs) to the analysis of prominent regional economic development and business incentive policies. As a result, impact evaluations of these policy interventions are being increasingly commissioned under the assumption that local linear regressions have superior impact identification properties in the cases in which an eligibility boundary, geographical border or application cutoff is identifiable as a source of treatment assignment. This paper shows that in a number of frequently encountered cases, however, economic development and business incentive programs pose peculiar impact identification conditions in terms of violations of main assumptions for the validity of RDDs and of running variables that have little or no influence of the outcome variable. Under these circumstances, that bear generalizable relevance also for the analysis of other public programs at large, no adequate testing to support the internal validity of the applied discontinuity design is often performed in the literature and the use of local linear/polynomial regressions, or cross-border comparisons, becomes an inadequate choice. When these conditions apply, adopting instead other quasi-experimental methods to achieve an actual adequate treatment-control balance of the relevant baseline characteristic will often be a better approach.JEL classification; O1; R5; C23
