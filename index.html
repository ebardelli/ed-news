          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>We use data from the Stanford Education Data Archive to describe district-level trends in average academic achievement between 2009 and 2019. Although on average school districts’ test scores improved very modestly (by about 0.001 standard deviations per year), there is significant variation among districts. Moreover, we find that average test score disparities between nonpoor and poor students and between White and Black students are growing; those between White and Hispanic students are shrinking. We find no evidence of achievement-equity synergies or trade-offs: Improvements in overall achievement are uncorrelated with trends in achievement disparities. Finally, we find that the strongest predictors of achievement disparity trends are the levels and trends in within-district racial and socioeconomic segregation and changes in differential access to certified teachers.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>The role of racial diversity at colleges has been debated for over more than a half a century with limited quasi-experimental evidence from classrooms. To fill this void, I estimate the extent that classmate racial compositions affect Hispanic and African American students at a large and oversubscribed California community college where they are minorities. I find that when minority students are exposed to a greater share of same-race classmates, they are more likely to complete the class with a pass and are more likely to enroll in a same-subject course the subsequent term. The findings are robust to first-time students with the lowest registration priority versus all students and different combinations of fixed effects (e.g., student, class, and instructor race).

          Abstract
                  <p>In the present longitudinal study, cross-lagged path models were applied to investigate the potential reciprocal relationships between senior secondary school students’ motivation and their cognitive engagement, using data from 623 Chinese senior secondary school students across 2 years. The 623 students completed self-reported measures of motivation and engagement at three time points within 2 years. The results suggest that the participants held a mixed type of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to learn mathematics and did not hold a deep level of cognitive engagement in mathematics learning. Compared with their extrinisic motivation, their intrinsic motivation to learn mathematics was more closely related to their cognitive engagement in mathematics learning, which points to a stronger reciprocal effect between their cognitive engagement and intrinsic motivation. The findings suggest that societal and cultural factors, such as the strong examination culture and high external expectations might be influential factors affecting the reciprocal relationships among students’ motivation and cognitive engagement.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics-specific learning difficulties and disabilities (MLD) have received increasing attention in scholarly research. In this study, we place MLD research in its wider context of risk societies by discussing the manufacturing of MLD as a risk. This framing of MLD builds on a certain idea of hope in how research could provide the means to better understand and support learners with MLD. We conduct a Foucault-informed analysis to understand how scholarly knowledge about MLD has been produced through discourses of risk and hope. Our material consists of 30 influential journal articles published in the three fields of MLD research: cognitive sciences, special education and mathematics education. Our study indicates that MLD has been predominantly conceptualised through a technico-scientific risk discourse that frames MLD as harmful for learners and societies alike; such risk discourse relies on a discourse of hope in scientific methods. We also analyse a social risk discourse that identifies risks in social exclusion and marginalisation of students with MLD, finding hope in inclusive learning environments. Based on our analysis, we propose that the mere conceptualisation of MLD has thoroughly revolved around discourses of current liminalities (risk) and enunciations of better futures (hope). However, what has been unexplored is the politics of such risk and hope discourses themselves. We propose a socio-politically oriented discourse of risk/hope as a way to reframe scientific knowledge production about MLD. This discourse identifies risks not in MLD itself but in how research manufactures MLD as a threat to both economic growth and student identities. Instead of asking research communities to mitigate the risk of MLD, we call for them to embrace it.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Little is available in mathematics education research about what the teacher can anticipate from the students when applying inquiry-based learning (IBL). Even less is known about how to recognize and exploit on the spot when a mathematical domain, other than the one in focus, is activated in the students’ minds. Yet, in tests, in everyday life, and  the labour market, it is common to face problems that require interrelated mathematical thinking. Although one of the unique advantages of complex mathematics education (CME) is the coherence between different domains and CME has been practiced for over half a century in Hungary, the Hungarian line of IBL has only recently joined the international methodological mainstream. In this paper, I summarize a segment of IBL correspondent to CME and integrated mathematics education, and I illustrate the possible divergence of solutions during implementation with an example that emerged about a probability game in a fifth-grade class.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article, an analysis of six fisheries biology assignments involving mathematical models is conducted, focusing on the type of participation that they offer. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the characteristics of the mathematical discourse of the assignments and to expose their relationship with the biological context with the purpose of understanding the role of mathematics discourse in other academic discourses. The theoretical orientation of the study is informed by commognitive theory which views learning of an academic discourse as the process of becoming a participant in that discourse. Data analysis revealed various aspects of mathematics wordings, tools and routines essential in the expected solution trajectories of the assignments and two types of required transitions, intrinsic and extrinsic, between mathematics and biology narratives. The article offers analytical and theoretical explanations for why this is the case as well as directions for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>After about two years of emergency remote teaching during the pandemic, the teaching of mathematics is slowly returning to (what used to be called) normal. However, after the period of mostly teaching online, there is uncertainty about the extent to which we will return to the way we were teaching before. In this survey paper we attempt to give some background to the impact that emergency remote teaching may have had on teaching mathematics. We examine the possible social implications and then focus on the changing mathematics classroom, focusing on the actual mathematics curriculum, learning design and assessment, the role of collaborative activities and social media, educational videos, and the role of family and parents in future. There are indicators from the literature that educators may not return to the traditional way of teaching entirely, especially in secondary and higher education. We conclude with describing some possible new research areas that have developed through emergency remote teaching, including online education for younger learners, local learning ecosystems, the role of family and parents, instructional design, and the mathematics content of curricula.</p>

      Abstract
      
                  <p>Recent research on integration has shown the importance of quantities-based meanings for integrals. However, this research body is still in need of detailed empirical accounts of how students develop such understandings across an entire unit on integration. This paper contributes by providing one such account, based on a quantities-based orientation called adding up pieces (AUP). Our study examines how three separate pairs of students learned definite integrals and integral functions within interview settings over four consecutive interview-lessons, meant to correspond to four consecutive in-class sessions. The first interview developed the partition, target quantity, and sum structure for definite integral, which were solidified in the second interview. The third and fourth interviews extended this AUP structure to a variable upper bound, output, and function structure for integral functions in preparation for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC).</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Legislative professionalism is central to the politico-institutional context of postsecondary policy adoption in state governments. The core argument in existing research is that as legislative professionalism increases, structural capacity for decision-making increases. Evidence for this argument is mixed, exclusively quantitative, and assumes a bureaucratic logic. The goal of this study is to deepen understanding of legislative professionalism by examining how policy stakeholders perceive the postsecondary policy environment in a “citizen legislature.” The study draws on 26 in-depth interviews with higher education stakeholders in Nevada. The findings contribute empirically to the literature by demonstrating that legislative professionalism can be understood in terms of the meanings assigned distinctive legislative environments. The results also make a conceptual contribution to this literature by showing how loose coupling in interorganizational relations and bounded rationality shape the policy environment—in ways that yield benefits for some institutions and disadvantages for others.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Tourism is one of the important factors that can affect the environmental and economic situation of any economy. This study investigates the relationship between tourist arrivals and CO2 emission in the top 20 tourist destinations using data from quarterly observations from 1995 to 2018. A unique technique via quantile-on-quantile regression and Granger causality in quantiles was used. In particular, how the quantiles of tourist arrivals impact quantiles of CO2 emission was analyzed. The empirical results suggest a combination of both positive and negative effects of tourist arrivals and CO2 emission in most tourist destinations. Predominantly, at both high and low tails, in the USA, Spain, Hong Kong, and Austria, tourist arrival has a positive effect on CO2 emission, whereas in the case of Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and Malaysia, the association was negative. On the other hand, China, Greece, Russia, Japan, Italy, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey have both positive and negative effects of tourism on CO2 emissions at low and high tails. Tourism can be an important factor while formulating policy for environmental and climate aspects.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The prediction of dangerous and/or violent behavior is particularly important to the conduct of the U.S. criminal justice system when it makes decisions about restrictions of personal freedom, such as preventive detention, forensic commitment, parole, and in some states such as Texas, when to permit an execution to proceed of an individual found guilty of a capital crime. This article discusses the prediction of dangerous behavior both through clinical judgment and actuarial assessment. The general conclusion drawn is that for both clinical and actuarial prediction of dangerous behavior, we are far from a level of accuracy that could justify routine use. To support this later negative assessment, two topic areas are emphasized: (1) the MacArthur Study of Mental Disorder and Violence, including the actuarial instrument developed as part of this project (the Classification of Violence Risk), along with all the data collected that helped develop the instrument; and (2) the U.S. Supreme Court case of Barefoot v. Estelle (1983) and the American Psychiatric Association “friend of the court” brief on the (in)accuracy of clinical prediction for the commission of future violence. Although now three decades old, Barefoot v. Estelle is still the controlling Supreme Court opinion regarding the prediction of future dangerous behavior and the imposition of the death penalty in states, such as Texas; for example, see Coble v. Texas (2011) and the Supreme Court denial of certiorari in that case.

          Abstract
                  <p>In prior work, we fit the mixture Rasch model to item responses from a fractions survey administered to a nationwide sample of middle grades mathematics teachers in the United States. The mixture Rasch model located teachers on a continuous, unidimensional scale and fit best with 3 latent classes. We used item response data to generate initial interpretations of the reasoning characteristic of each latent class. Our results suggested increasing facility reasoning about fraction arithmetic from one class to the next. The present study contributes two further arguments for the validity of our initial interpretations. First, we administered the same survey to a new sample of future middle grades mathematics teachers before and after 20 weeks of instruction on multiplication, division, and fractions, and we found that from pretest to posttest future teachers transitioned from one latent class to another in ways consistent with increased proficiency in fraction arithmetic. Second, we interviewed 8 of the future teachers before and after the instruction and found that future teachers’ reasoning during interviews was largely consistent with our original interpretation of the 3 latent classes. These results provide further support for our original interpretation of the mixture Rasch analysis, demonstrate the utility of our approach for capturing growth and change in future teachers’ reasoning during teacher education coursework, and contribute innovative applications of psychometric models for surveying teachers’ reasoning at scale.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of this study is to examine the performances of university students’ using dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra in argumentations and proving processes. A task related to the limit involving sin
                    
                    \(x\)
                    
                  /x was designed and 18 university students worked on the task during the collaborative learning, scientific debate, and self-reflection stages. Students’ argumentations and proofs were analyzed based on Toulmin’s model and Habermas’ construct of rationality. The results revealed that the rationality components can be used to explain the implicit features of warrant in Toulmin’s model. It was found that the semiotic mediation opportunities offered by GeoGebra and the teamwork and debate stages in the teaching method enabled the students to create geometrically the ranking relation between the value of an angle and the sine and tangent values of this angle. They also facilitated using the various kinds of representation and enhanced the transformations within and/or between the representations. GeoGebra tools as instruments of semiotic mediation helped the students to construct productive arguments, validate them, be productive by providing backing and rebuttal to the collective arguments put forward during the teamwork stage, and reach consensus thanks to scientific debate.</p>
