  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study explores how teachers’ unions are responding to the growing policy of dual enrollment (DE). I reviewed all available collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) of public schools in Ohio, using qualitative content analysis to look for ways that CBAs are addressing DE policy. Analysis revealed four themes. The first theme suggests that teachers’ unions are incrementally bargaining provisions addressing DE into their CBAs. Of the 586 CBAs analyzed, 160 included provisions regarding DE. The three remaining themes centered around working conditions for teachers, including provisions related to monetary compensation, existential protection of bargaining unit members, and the protection of teacher time. Additionally, district typography was explored, revealing that wealthier/smaller school districts have bargained more teacher protections for DE than larger districts with less wealth. This study provides information about what might be of interest to teachers and policymakers when reforming DE policy.

  Abstract
                  <p>Given the recent development of mobile gaze-tracking devices it has become possible to view and interpret what the student sees and unravel the associated problem-solving processes further. It has also become possible to pinpoint joint attention occurrences that are fundamental for learning. In this study, we examined joint attention in collaborative mathematical problem solving. We studied the thought processes of four 15–16-year-old students in their regular classroom, using mobile gaze tracking, video and audio recordings, and smartpens. The four students worked as a group to find the shortest path to connect the vertices of a square. Combining information on the student gaze targets with a qualitative interpretation of the context, we identified the occurrences of joint attention, out of which 49 were joint visual attention occurrences and 28 were attention to different representations of the same mathematical idea. We call this joint representational attention. We discovered that ‘verifying’ (43%) and ‘watching and listening’ (35%) were the most common phases during joint attention. The most frequently occurring problem solving phases right after joint attention were also ‘verifying’ (47%) and ‘watching and listening’ (34%). We detected phase cycles commonly found in individual problem-solving processes (‘planning and exploring’, ‘implementing’, and ‘verifying’) outside of joint attention. We also detected phase shifts between ‘verifying’, ‘watching and listening’, and ‘understanding’ a problem, often occurring during joint attention. Therefore, these phases can be seen as a signal of successful interaction and the promotion of collaboration.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>How can school mathematics prepare citizens for a democratic society? Answers to this question are not static; they change as society and its problems change. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its corresponding disease COVID-19 presents such a problem: what is needed to navigate this complex situation that involves, among other things, mathematics? Using the essay genre, we use three narratives from three countries—Italy, the USA (California), and Germany—to reflect on the goals of teaching mathematics during this crisis and examine aspects of each country’s standards for mathematics education. These three stories are framed by the authors’ backgrounds, experiences, interests, their country’s situation, and response to the pandemic. We first present the three narratives and then examine common issues across them that might provide insights beyond this current crisis, for preparing students to become active citizens. In particular, we focus on three issues: (1) developing a positive mindset toward mathematics to engage with and reflect on real-world problems, (2) improving interdisciplinary connections to the sciences to better understand how science professional practices and insights are similar or different from everyday practices, and (3) considering interpersonal and collective matters beyond the individual.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>One of the primary goals of international large-scale assessments in education is the comparison of country means in student achievement. This article introduces a framework for discussing differential item functioning (DIF) for such mean comparisons. We compare three different linking methods: concurrent scaling based on full invariance, concurrent scaling based on partial invariance using the RMSD statistic, and robust and nonrobust linking approaches based on separate scaling. Furthermore, we analytically derive the bias in the country means of different linking methods in the presence of DIF. In a simulation study, we show that the partial invariance and robust linking approaches provide less biased country means than the full invariance approach in the case of biased items.

  Abstract
                  <p>Implementation support strategies such as professional development (PD) are pivotal in guaranteeing the assistance that teachers need to enact mathematics teaching innovations and to secure lasting change. Within large-scale efforts an important issue for researchers is to understand how to design and put into effect these implementation support strategies. Although some work has been done to examine the challenges of implementing PD to advance the enactment of mathematics teaching innovations in new school settings, little is known about the multiple challenges novice facilitators face when providing PD for fellow teachers in their local districts and communities. In this paper we report on a 3-year long study that examined how a novice facilitator learned to deal with these challenges and become confident in his new role. Drawing on Graven’s (Educational Studies in Mathematics 57(2), 177–211, 2004) expanded model of learning, a case study and an interpretative approach are used to investigate a novice facilitator’s process of becoming confident. The findings provide evidence that becoming confident is part of an ongoing process of learning through (1) experiencing or constructing new meanings for problem solving as an instructional approach; (2) doing or enacting the instructional approach; and (3) engaging in the core PD practices. Recommendations for the education of PD facilitators in large-scale initiatives are provided.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article offers a framework for analyzing social movement participation in public education through a focus on universities in Brazil. It builds on the literature on social movement–state relations, participatory governance, and community organizing in schools, drawing on the case of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement and the National Program for Education in Areas of Agrarian Reform (PRONERA) to illustrate the need to recenter the idea of conflict as a central and ongoing process of social movement participation in public schools and universities. The article also introduces the concept of prefiguration and highlights how students can prefigure in the formal public school system the types of social and economic practices they hope to build in the future. Contentious cogovernance and prefiguration are tools not only for improving educational equity but also for increasing the strength and internal capacity of social movements, paralleling the role Paulo Freire envisioned for nonformal popular education within grassroots organizations.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Freshman seminars are a ubiquitous offering in higher education, but they have not been evaluated using matched comparisons with data at scale. In this work, we use transcript data on over 76,000 students to examine the impact of first-year interest groups (FIGs) on student graduation and retention. We first apply propensity score matching on course-level data to account for selection bias. We find that graduation and re-enrollment rates for FIG students were higher than non-FIG students, an effect that was more pronounced for self-identified underrepresented racial minority students. We then employ topic modeling to analyze survey responses from over 12,500 FIG students to find that social aspects of FIGs were most beneficial to students. Interestingly, references to social aspects were not disproportionately present in the responses of self-identified underrepresented racial minority students.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study examines the collective mathematical reasoning when students and teachers in grades 3, 4, and 5 explore fractions derived from length comparisons, in a task inspired by the El´konin and Davydov curriculum. The analysis showed that the mathematical reasoning was mainly anchored in mathematical properties related to fractional or algebraic thinking. Further analysis showed that these arguments were characterised by interplay between fractional and algebraic thinking except in the conclusion stage. In the conclusion and the evaluative arguments, these two types of thinking appeared to be intertwined. Another result is the discovery of a new type of argument, identifying arguments, which deals with the first step in task solving. Here, the different types of arguments, including the identifying arguments, were not initiated only by the teachers but also by the students. This in a multilingual classroom with a large proportion of students newly arrived. Compared to earlier research, this study offers a more detailed analysis of algebraic and fractional thinking including possible patterns within the collective mathematical reasoning. An implication of this is that algebraic and fractional thinking appear to be more intertwined than previous suggested.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Mathematics teacher coaching is a promising but largely overlooked form of professional development (PD) for supporting mathematics teachers’ learning of justice-oriented teaching. In this article, we critically review the literature to illuminate what we currently know about mathematics teacher coaching and to highlight studies’ contributions and limitations to inform future work. Broadly, we find that four programs of research have developed, investigating: (a) coaches’ activities and relationships, (b) the effects of coaching on student assessment scores, (c) the effects of coaching on teachers’ practices or behaviors, and (d) the effects of coaching on teachers’ knowledge or beliefs. From this analysis, we argue that justice-oriented perspectives of teaching, in tandem with sociocultural theories of teachers’ learning, could allow for more nuanced investigations of coaching and could support design of learning experiences for teachers that bring us closer to educational justice.

  Abstract
                  <p>Feedback provided by mathematics teachers usually addresses procedural skills and, to a much lesser extent, other competencies such as conceptual understanding or engagement in mathematical practices. As most previous literature has studied feedback provided on homework or video prompts, how teachers provide such feedback in the classroom is poorly understood. Here, sixteen lessons taught by five teachers were purposefully sampled from a larger video study (172 lessons) as lessons with high-quality feedback according to a standardized observation instrument. The analysis focused on the instructional situations in which teachers provided feedback. When teachers provided procedural feedback, the situations were orderly and effective. Feedback on conceptual understanding and mathematical practices was provided in situations when students were especially challenged, and entailed a series of complex decisions, thereby placing demands on the teachers to manage both the students’ understanding and behavior. We argue that researchers should focus on how teachers and students negotiate the instructional situation to allow for feedback on conceptual understanding or mathematical practices.</p>

We related their written justifications (part of the task) to the task characteristics, which included various semiotic systems (verbal, numerical and alphanumeric, among others) and the demand of different type of justifications. The role of classroom discussion in helping express the functional relationship orally in more sophisticated terms was also investigated. The findings showed that students’ written justifications changed with the semiotic system involved in the task. Oral discussion helped students generalize in more sophisticated terms than in their written justifications, in which they omitted information or used less precise language.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>International comparative studies on mathematics teaching and learning often provide unitary and harmonious images of classroom practices. This paper aims to complement those studies by describing the complex aspects of those practices. Adopting activity theory as a framework, this paper considers classroom teaching and learning of mathematics as an activity system embedded in socio-historical contexts, analyzes its contradictions, and makes a comparative analysis of different practices of mathematics teaching and learning in the same country. As a case in point, mathematics lessons in Japanese secondary schools are considered. The initial activity system of mathematics lessons in Japanese modern schools came from the whole-class instruction system and then gradually evolved into the problem-solving style lesson. The latter has been facing challenges, and then a new activity system has emerged from a new paradigm of school education. It is argued that activity systems analysis enables us to understand the contradictions prevailing in mathematics education and that comparative analysis of more than one system in the same culture can provide valuable insights.</p>

One approach that specifically deals with clustered data but has seen little use in education is the generalized estimating equations (GEEs) approach. We provide a background on GEEs, discuss why it is appropriate for the analysis of clustered data, and provide worked examples using both continuous and binary outcomes. Comparisons are made between GEEs, multilevel models, and ordinary least squares results to highlight similarities and differences between the approaches. Detailed walkthroughs are provided using both R and SPSS Version 26.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this study, dormitory room and social group assignment data from a college are used to investigate peer effects on college students’ decisions to switch majors. Results reveal strong evidence of such peer effects at both the room and the social group level. Most notably, at the room level, the dense concentration of same-major roommates deters students from switching majors; having one or two same-major roommates has no significant effect on major switching, indicating strong nonlinearity of peer effects at the room level. Such nonlinearity is not observed among social group members. Results also reveal evidence that students’ choices of new majors are affected by peers’ majors. Peers are more likely to choose the same destination majors than nonpeers. In choosing their new majors, students do not necessarily follow their peers indiscriminately. Their decisions seem to be influenced more by short-term academic requirements than by long-term job prospects. Finally, peer effects on major switching and major choices are stronger at the dormitory room level than at the social group level in most cases.

  Abstract
                  <p>With this article, we aim to spur a conversation on research implementation in the context of collaborations of mathematics teachers and educational researchers, with a special interest in projects situated in university mathematics education. Implementation has been often discussed in relation to the education of school teachers, and we suggest that the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical apparatus that has been developed in this research area can be re-purposed to study implementation. Specifically, we propose that in collaborative projects, implementation can be construed as an interactive change-oriented process, in which teachers and researchers develop their praxeologies through interaction and joint work on boundary objects. We illustrate the usefulness of this proposal with a teacher-mathematician and a mathematics education researcher who joined forces to introduce scriptwriting activities into an undergraduate mathematics course. Drawing on the theoretical analysis and illustration, we make suggestions for future implementation studies in the context of teacher-researcher collaborations.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Recent developments in cognitive and educational science highlight the role of the body in learning. Novel digital technologies increasingly facilitate bodily interaction. Aiming for understanding of the body’s role in learning mathematics with technology, we reconsider the instrumental approach from a radical embodied cognitive science perspective. We highlight the complexity of any action regulation, which is performed by a complex dynamic functional system of the body and brain in perception-action loops driven by multilevel intentionality. Unlike mental schemes, functional systems are decentralized and can be extended by artifacts. We introduce the notion of a body-artifact functional system, pointing to the fact that artifacts are included in the perception-action loops of instrumented actions. The theoretical statements of this radical embodied reconsideration of the instrumental approach are illustrated by an empirical example, in which embodied activities led a student to the development of instrumented actions with a unit circle as an instrument to construct a sine graph. Supplementing videography of the student’s embodied actions and gestures with eye-tracking data, we show how new functional systems can be formed. Educational means to facilitate the development of body-artifact functional systems are discussed.</p>
