  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Using a dis/ability critical race theory (DisCrit) and critical quantitative (QuantCrit) lens, we examine disproportionate application of exclusionary discipline on multiply marginalized youth, foregrounding systemic injustice and institutionalized racism. In doing so, we examined temporal-, student-, and school-level factors that may result in exclusion and othering (i.e., placing into special education and punishing with out-of-school suspensions) within one school district. We frame this study in DisCrit and QuantCrit frameworks to connect data-based decision making to sociocultural understandings of the ways in which schools use both special education and discipline to simultaneously provide and limit opportunities for different student groups. Results showed a complex interconnectedness between student sociodemographic labels (e.g., gender, race, and socioeconomic status) and factors associated with both special education identification and exclusionary discipline. Our findings suggest that quantitative studies lacking in-depth theoretical justification may perpetuate deficit understandings of the racialization of disability and intersections with exclusionary discipline.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We evaluate the feasibility of estimating test-score growth for schools and districts with a gap year in test data. Our research design uses a simulated gap year in testing when a true test gap did not occur, which facilitates comparisons of district- and school-level growth estimates with and without a gap year. We find that growth estimates based on the full data and gap-year data are generally similar, establishing that useful growth measures can be constructed with a gap year in test data. Our findings apply most directly to testing disruptions that occur in the absence of other disruptions to the school system. They also provide insights about the test stoppage induced by COVID-19, although our work is just a first step toward producing informative school- and district-level growth measures from the pandemic period.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This study investigates how youth from two cities in the United States engage in critical data practices as they learn about and take action in their lives and communities in relation to COVID-19 and its intersections with justice-related concerns. Guided by theories of critical data literacies and data justice, a historicized and future-oriented participatory methodological approach is used to center the lived lives and communities of participants through dialogic interviews and experience sampling method. Data were co-analyzed with participants using critical grounded theory. Findings illustrate how youth not only aimed to reveal the dynamic and human aspects of and relationships with data as they engage with/in the world as people who matter but also offered alternative infrastructures for counter data production and aggregation toward justice in the here and now and desired possible futures. Implications for studies of learning with/through data practices in everyday life in relation to issues of justice are discussed.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Drawing from a context of reception framework, this article asks the following questions: How do educators describe issues of safety and belonging in the context of a charged immigration policy climate? What practices have educators developed to support immigrant-origin youth? And, what are the relationships between educators’ perceptions of safety and belonging and educator practices? We analyze educators’ survey responses administered across six school districts in different contexts across the United States, including the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. We synthesize four domains of educator practice: signaling affirmation, building shared knowledge and capacity, finding and mobilizing resources, and creating space for conversation. Through this work, we connect the domain of safety as a perennial theme to safety as a practice. We discuss the implications of this and the need for future work that critically analyzes educators’ practice in relation to immigrant-origin youth for more generative contexts—contexts of development, not merely reception.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Student evaluations of teaching are widely used to assess instructors and courses. Using a model-based approach and Bayesian methods, we examine how the direction of the scale, labels on scales, and the number of options affect the ratings. We conduct a within-participants experiment in which respondents evaluate instructors and lectures using different scales. We find that people tend to give positive ratings, especially when using letter scales compared with number scales. Furthermore, people tend to use the end-points less often when a scale is presented in reverse. Our model-based analysis allows us to infer how the features of scales shift responses to higher or lower ratings and how they compress scale use to make end-point responses more or less likely. The model also makes predictions about equivalent ratings across scales, which we demonstrate using real-world evaluation data. Our study has implications for the design of scales and for their use in assessment.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article suggests two approaches for sharing education research based on a model of research dissemination for Twitter pioneered by the medical community. The first approach is the visual abstract that reflects a visual summary of a study’s textual abstract. Evidence demonstrates that compared with a text-alone approach, the visual abstract yields eight times as many shares on Twitter and three times as many people clicking to access the full article. The second strategy is the translational visual abstract that is designed for sharing education research with nonscientific audiences. I provide a general overview of using Twitter for research dissemination, describe each visual approach and share step-by-step design guidelines, offer recommendations for using these visuals for dissemination purposes, and conclude with future directions for investigating the effectiveness of visual abstracts and translational visual abstracts for communicating education research.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Previous reports suggest that administrators rarely dismiss low-performing teachers despite the changing policy landscape allowing them to do so. This brief uses survey data from Tennessee to investigate the underlying reasons explaining administrators’ decisions to retain low-performing teachers. The presented analysis suggests that administrators largely retain low-performing teachers due to a persistent belief that these teachers will improve with time; further analysis presents some evidence regarding observable improvement among low-performing teachers. The brief concludes with a brief discussion of implications for policy and practice.

  Abstract
                  <p>When it comes to choosing tasks, values can have a significant impact. This study explores teachers’ values as they choose one task from among three that they believe will have the most potential to occasion mathematical creativity in the classroom. Participants’ analyses of each task, as well as their reasons for choosing one task as most preferred, were analyzed in terms of task features and cognitive demands, as well as their explicit reference to fluency, flexibility, and originality. Two values shared by most participants were having several solution paths and a task that would challenge students. Of particular interest are task features and cognitive demands that were associated with a task at the initial stage of analysis but were not mentioned as a reason for choosing that task as occasioning mathematical creativity. Dilemmas and challenges regarding the study of values are discussed.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Education researchers use surveys widely. Yet, critics question respondents’ ability to provide high-quality responses. As schools increasingly use student surveys to drive local policy making, respondents’ (lack of) motivation to provide quality responses may threaten the wisdom of using questionnaires for data-based decision making. To better understand student satisficing—the practice of suboptimal responding on surveys—and its impact on data quality, we examined its pervasiveness and impact on a large-scale social–emotional learning survey administered to 409,721 elementary and secondary students. Findings indicated that despite the prevalence of satisficing, its impact on data quality appeared more modest than anticipated. We conclude by outlining an accessible approach for defining and calculating satisficing for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article addresses the importance of action research to provide approaches to emphasizing and acknowledging artful aspects of professional practice in public sector organizations. The article introduces the philosophical works of Knud Ejler Løgstrup and Kari Martinsen as perspectives on artful aspects of professional practices and knowing. In order to concentrate on artful aspects of the research process, empirical material from two arts-involving workshops with teachers are presented as the concrete methodological expression of the participatory ideas of action research. The article addresses embodied dimensions of practice, the role of sensory awareness in professional knowing in organizations, which are some of the main preconditions for contributing to creative, social change, and scholarly weight. Thus, the article contributes with ways to regard action research as artful, participatory processes and practices that enable creation of organizational and public knowledge on the artful aspects of professional practice.

In our data set, 40.7% of the respondents reported that their career plans have been affected by Trump’s antiscience policies, 54.5% by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study revealed three themes, which were (1) awareness of the reduced funding for STEM (science, engineering, technology, and mathematics) and higher education, (2) heightened awareness of and commitment to the pursuit of social and racial justice, (3) interest in seeking job opportunities abroad. The top three themes for the COVID-19 pandemic were (1) shifting graduation timelines and adjusting research to the virtual campus life; (2) losing jobs, concerning about hiring freezes and fewer job openings; and (3) reconsidering their place in a STEM field postpandemic, including a possible complete change in career plans; thoughts of leaving the country for international jobs.

There is a growing recognition that immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior has spillover effects onto U.S. citizens. I examine the impacts of a type of partnership between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement, 287(g) programs, on school engagement within North Carolina. In North Carolina, nine counties were approved to establish 287(g) programs, and another 15 applied but were not approved to participate. I use a triple difference strategy in which I compare educational outcomes for different groups of students in these two sets of counties before and after activation of 287(g) programs between 2003/2004 and 2012/2013. I find that 287(g) programs decrease school engagement by decreasing attendance. This effect appears to be driven by increabes in chronic absenteeism (missing 15 or more days per year).

We also explore disparities by parent race/ethnicity, income, urbanicity, partisanship, and grade level (i.e., elementary school vs. middle/high school). Results shed light on the vectors of inequality that occurred throughout the pandemic in access to technology, instruction, services (e.g., free and reduced-price meals), and in-person learning opportunities. Our work highlights the equity implications of the pandemic and suggests the importance of encouraging widespread in-person learning opportunities and attendance by the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year for addressing COVID-19’s educational effects.

  Abstract
                  <p>Proving and refuting are fundamental aspects of mathematical practice that are intertwined in mathematical activity in which conjectures and proofs are often produced and improved through the back-and-forth transition between attempts to prove and disprove. One aspect underexplored in the education literature is the connection between this activity and the construction by students of knowledge, such as mathematical concepts and theorems, that is new to them. This issue is significant to seeking a better integration of mathematical practice and content, emphasised in curricula in several countries. In this paper, we address this issue by exploring how students generate mathematical knowledge through discovering and handling refutations. We first explicate a model depicting the generation of mathematical knowledge through heuristic refutation (revising conjectures/proofs through discovering and addressing counterexamples) and draw on a model representing different types of abductive reasoning. We employed both models, together with the literature on the teachers’ role in orchestrating whole-class discussion, to analyse a series of classroom lessons involving secondary school students (aged 14–15 years, Grade 9). Our analysis uncovers the process by which the students discovered a counterexample invalidating their proof and then worked via creative abduction where a certain theorem was produced to cope with the counterexample. The paper highlights the roles played by the teacher in supporting the students’ work and the importance of careful task design. One implication is better insight into the form of activity in which students learn mathematical content while engaging in mathematical practice.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Students entering sixth grade operate with three different multiplicative concepts that influence their reasoning in many domains important for middle school. For example, students who are operating with the second multiplicative concept (MC2 students) can begin to construct fractions as lengths but do not construct improper fractions as numbers. Students who are operating with the third multiplicative concept (MC3 students) can construct both proper and improper fractions as multiples of unit fractions. This paper is a case study of one seventh grade MC2 student, Milo, who demonstrated the most advanced reasoning of all MC2 students in a large project with 13 MC2 and 9 MC3 students. In working on problems involving fractional relationships between two unknowns, most MC3 students constructed reciprocal reasoning. In contrast, the MC2 students struggled with these problems. Similar to the MC3 students, Milo showed some evidence of reciprocal reasoning, and he used proper fractions as operators on unknowns with a rationale. However, Milo did not construct reciprocal reasoning. We account for his reasoning by showing how he used length meanings for proper fractions and how he coordinated two different two-levels-of-units structures. The study expands the mathematics for MC2 students, showing what learning may be possible for students like Milo, and it suggests a change to the theory of students’ multiplicative concepts. Specifically, advanced MC2 students are those who have constructed length meanings for fractions and can coordinate two different two-levels-of-units structures.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, educational and psychological perspectives are used to examine how anxiety and uncertainty in the mathematics classroom can be reframed to benefit mathematical teaching and learning. Links between anxiety and uncertainty are discussed and from this discussion, two methods are proposed for reducing the negative impact of mathematics anxiety on learning. Firstly, it is argued that initiatives designed to teach students to use emotion regulation skills can help to reframe anxiety and improve students’ ability to regulate negative emotion. In particular, the skill of reappraisal is discussed. Secondly, it is proposed that pedagogical approaches that encourage students to embrace challenge will help to normalise uncertainty in classrooms and promote more positive affect and engagement with mathematics. These approaches include choosing suitable tasks, differentiating those tasks, orchestrating classroom discussions that include all students and consolidating the learning with further tasks suitably varied. Rather than teachers seeking to remove anxiety, students can be encouraged to manage their anxiety in order to promote more positive mathematical learning and to develop mathematical resilience.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>There are many studies about women in science. They reveal, among other findings, that men and women generally do not enroll in the same science streams. Going beyond this observation, it becomes relevant to examine representations of the sciences among male and female science students to determine what influences their choices. Our study is based on a survey among a representative sample of 1352 first-year science students at the University of Lille. Our results, both quantitative and qualitative, underscore the relevance of streams in the rationalization of these different representations of sciences, for one, and show that the correlation is not due to a gendered structure of the streams, for another. Indeed, there are significant differences in attitudes towards the sciences regardless of whether a student is male or female, but these attitudes are strongly correlated with the student’s chosen stream. It is therefore important to keep the influence of gender on representations of science in perspective.</p>
