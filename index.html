  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This review focuses on students’ perceptions of their rights in elementary and secondary schools. The conceptual framework of rights consciousness was applied to understand how students’ knowledge, experiences, and emotions shape their rights perceptions. The analysis is based on 38 empirical studies conducted in different countries. The findings characterize students’ rights perceptions as intuitive—that is, perceptions that are not grounded in legal rules but in students’ personal insights. The findings also identify key factors affecting students’ perceptions: school context, national context, and students’ individual characteristics. The conclusions underscore that school rights-based practices, student body and school staff diversity, and school relationships influence students’ rights consciousness. However, questions remain concerning how students’ perceptions are affected by cultural repertoires, religion, socioeconomic status, gender, and age. The implications are that future studies should apply a context-based agenda to inform the design and implementation of human rights education programs and rights-based organizational practices.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>School environment plays an important role in student outcomes. Increasingly, research has also highlighted the role school environment plays in the White–Black suspension gap. We test whether magnet schools reduce the White–Black suspension gap using data from Tulsa Public Schools. Using student-level and incident-level data from Tulsa, Oklahoma, we explore whether Black students receive exclusionary discipline at lower rates in magnet schools than in traditional schools compared with White students. Using matching techniques to minimize selection bias, we find that magnet schools in Tulsa are associated with a reduction in the racial suspension gap. In magnet schools in Tulsa, we do not find a racial gap in severity of incident or days assigned.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>While research has documented outcomes for students served by promise programs, few studies have considered the behavior of institutions themselves in the promise era. A new source of revenue combined with larger and more diverse cohorts is likely to motivate changes in spending and staffing—decisions instrumental to student access and success. We employ complementary difference-in-differences and synthetic control strategies to estimate impacts of the first statewide promise program on these two outcomes. Findings suggest institutions diverted expenditures away from instruction, academic support, and institutional support toward greater institutional grant awards. We find no meaningful impact on staffing levels. While some institutional actions may further support the access and success goals of promise programs, the diversity of programs across the nation suggests not all may follow suit. This study should inform policy makers considering the full extent of outcomes of free-college programs and invigorate further research on institutional responses.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Guided by legal, sociolegal, and higher education concepts, we use an embedded case study of university administrators at a public institution to examine how they negotiate and institutionalize principles of freedom of expression and inclusion in responses to the proliferation of on-campus hate speech following the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Our findings reveal that an institution's legal context and administrators’ interpretations of law and law-related pressures shape their understanding of hate speech–related incidents, and the permissible responses, in ways that make it nearly impossible to consider and implement inclusion-focused practices. We advance the concept of “repressive legalism” to explain these dynamics and discuss implications for policies and practices that support both open, robust expression and inclusion for students of color.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article examines the teaching practices and pedagogical theories preservice teachers (PSTs) enacted in a newly designed after-school literacy club field placement. We draw from sociocultural and activity theories to analyze data collected in the qualitative study that examined the following research questions: (1) What teaching practices do PSTs enact in an after-school literacy club field placement? (2) What pedagogical theories guide their choices about which teaching practices they enact in the after-school literacy club field placement? and (3) In what ways does this field placement afford and constrain PSTs’ appropriation of these practices and theories? Findings consider three ways that the field experience afforded—and at times also constrained—the opportunities made available for PSTs to enact teaching practices and pedagogical theories related to their learning in coursework including learning from and with fellow PSTs, developing ownership over curriculum, and making connections to university coursework.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Using data with detailed instructor employment information from a state college system, this study examines disciplinary variations in the characteristics and effects of non-tenure-track faculty hired through temporary and long-term employment. We identify substantial differences in demographic and employment characteristics between the two types of non-tenure-line faculty, where the differences are most pronounced in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health-related fields (STEM) at 4-year colleges. Using an instrumental variables strategy to address student sorting, our analyses indicate that taking introductory courses with temporary adjuncts reduces subsequent interest, and the effects are particularly large in STEM fields at 4-year colleges. Long-term non-tenure faculty are generally comparable with tenure-track faculty in student subsequent interest, but tenure-track faculty are associated with better subsequent performance in a handful of fields.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We replicate and extend prior work on Florida’s Bright Futures merit aid scholarship to consider its effect on college enrollment and degree completion. We estimate causal impacts using a regression discontinuity design to exploit SAT thresholds that strongly determine eligibility. We find no positive impacts on attendance or attainment, and instrumental variable results generally reject estimates as small as 1 to 2 percentage points. Across subgroups, we find that eligibility slightly reduces 6-year associate degree attainment for lower socioeconomic status students and may induce small enrollment shifts among Hispanic and White students toward 4-year colleges. Our findings of these minimal-at-best impacts contrast those of prior works, attributable in part to methodological improvements and more robust data, and further underscore the importance of study replication.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Interdistrict desegregation programs, which provide opportunities for urban children of color to attend suburban schools, are a potential means of addressing persistent racial inequalities in educational opportunities and outcomes. These voluntary programs offer a test of whether nonresident students can leverage the resources and social capital available at high-performing suburban schools to improve their educational outcomes. In the first impact study of Boston’s long-running program, I find large differences in the adjusted high-school graduation and college enrollment rates of applicants referred to a suburban district, compared with observably similar applicants who were not referred. The college effect is due to enrollment in 4-year institutions and does not vary by gender. Estimates are robust to adjustments for remaining omitted variables bias.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This research sought to develop an initial understanding of how mandated policies related to lockdown safety drills are enacted in response to active shooter scenarios within PK-Grade 12 public schools. In light of a scant research base exploring the effectiveness and impacts of such policies and procedures, we explored the question, What are school counselors’ lived experiences with lockdown drills?. Using a phenomenological design, we interviewed 26 school counselors from five school districts from the Southeastern United States during the 2019 academic year. Findings center around four key themes: Awareness of School Violence, Necessity and Variability in Preparation, Paradox of Safety, and Communication as Support and Challenge. We will discuss the tensions, or push and pulls/contradictions, that are a part of both drills and actual incidents across these themes. To conclude, we present recommendations for further research and policy to support informed, reflexive action.

Using case study and Accidental Ethnography data, we explore the actions that adult facilitators take to support student voice efforts in policy spaces. Our findings include that adults (1) intentionally shift power to students, (2) help students understand the power of their voice, and (3) help students to resist and overcome tokenization. We discuss our findings in the context of power and helping historically unpowerful groups exercise policy voice.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Decades after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling banned mandatory race-based separation of students to different schools, school segregation, and inequality in the United States are rapidly increasing. In this research synthesis, I propose a model for explaining how segregation and inequality are formed in urban and suburban school systems and exacerbated even in the absence of formal segregation policy. The model describes segregation as a component in a triangle of discriminatory education policy processes: segregation, discrimination, and signaling. Connecting these three seemingly distinct policy practices could provide a better explanation for the growing inequality in the U.S. school system.

This study of eight states presents three different approaches to the evidence requirements: using lists of pre-sanctioned evidence-based interventions, training schools and districts to evaluate the research supporting potential interventions, and building local evidence of effectiveness. Through interviews with state administrators, I show how each approach relied on different understandings and prioritizations of research rigor and local relevance.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Literature examining the context of reception reveals how various structural and cultural factors shape newcomers’ experiences, and thus their opportunities for integration. Fewer studies explore how school districts are situated in this broader context of reception, or how district policies and practices for newcomers are enabled or constrained by the local context. This study draws on a zones of mediation framework to examine how external forces mediated districts’ approaches to serving growing numbers of immigrant and refugee newcomers. Analysis of interviews with 57 stakeholders from across three districts revealed that the presence or absence of community-based support networks, as well as the extent to which local policies and perceptions emphasized inclusion, mediated districts’ programmatic approaches. Implications for district and community leaders are discussed.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Long-term school absences during pandemic lockdowns may result in learning gains and losses much like the summer reading loss, but little is known about the actual effects of such lockdowns. This mixed-methods study examined changes in reading enjoyment, amount and resources in three groups of bilingual children—English-Chinese, English-Malay, and English-Tamil speaking children—during the COVID-19 lockdown in Singapore. Results reveal a lockdown reading gap between children’s stronger language (English) and weaker language (Chinese/Malay/Tamil). Within each language, results show differential reading gains and losses for children who enjoyed and did not enjoy reading in print and digital formats. Children’s reading enjoyment before the lockdown, changes in reading enjoyment and print reading amount during the lockdown in English and Chinese/Malay were significantly correlated. Children preferred print reading over reading digitally both before and during the lockdown, and devices were underutilized for reading purposes.

  Abstract
                  <p>Students’ negative affective performance in mathematics learning is a global problem, and the situation is especially challenging in high-achieving East Asian countries. Taiwan’s Just Do Math (JDM) program was launched to resolve this problem and to serve as an example of successful scaling up with regard to implementation of innovation. We developed a framework consisting of a synthesis of the literature on essentials for successful implementation and for scaling up, and applied this framework for the purpose of identification of the factors contributing to the success of the JDM program. The identified factors include the following: the development of low-complexity sources for teachers’ use and the low degree of adaptation required to sustain fidelity; the consideration of characteristics of adopters to promote innovation outside schools; construction of communication channels to ensure the dissemination of the core ideas of JDM; the feedback mechanism through which participating teachers can acknowledge the relative advantages of innovation as realized in the program; the consideration of the influence of historical, social, political, and economic factors on program implementation; and the efforts to ensure teachers’ in-depth learning, acknowledgment of the promoted principles, and the sustainability of implementation through implementation of JDM activities in regular mathematics classes.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>We report a study on mathematical literacy with special emphasis on health literacy. In particular, we identify and characterize the mathematical competencies that a citizen needs to interpret the official information on the COVID-19 pandemic as experienced in Mexico. To achieve this, we analyze the daily reports on the pandemic issued by the Mexican Ministry of Health, using the framework of mathematical competencies as a theoretical lens. Our results show that there are five necessary competencies to interpret the official information: mathematical communication, mathematical representation, mathematical symbols and formalism, mathematical modeling, and mathematical reasoning competency. After characterizing and illustrating these competencies, we close the paper with a reflection on the importance of mathematical literacy in a pandemic world.</p>
