  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Using a panel dataset from 2000 to 2014, this paper employs a difference-in-difference design to consider the impact of the introduction of a “promise program” on postsecondary institutions’ internal spending levels and patterns. We find that promise programs influence postsecondary institutional behavior in every area we tested: student-related and non-student-related expenditure levels and shares. We find decreases in student-related expenditure areas at 2-year institutions, but no significant change at 4-years. Non-student-related expenditures are mixed at 2-years with levels of expenditures increasing for auxiliary but decreasing in public service areas. By contrast public service expenditures increase at 4-years. Shares of expenses also shift with declining spending on student services but increased institutional support at 2-years. However, there are no changes to the share of expenses at 4-years. Overall, we find that 2- and 4-year institutions react differently to the introduction of a promise program, with the greatest impact at 2-years.JEL Classifications: I22, I23

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Let us start at the beginning of this Special Issue on Artfulness with the Call for Papers. As a reminder, we invited contributors to write from their experience and to experiment with bringing their entire selves to their organisational and community work. In the Call for Papers we highlighted that this means ‘not only the rational and logical parts of who we are, but also our creative, intuitive, relational and artistic abilities in their many forms’. We stressed that art can be both an artefact, for example, a painting, piece of music or even a project. Or it can be the creative processes we use, for example, the artfulness of how we work with others in an organisation or in creating art. We see lively tensions between the two. When the submissions came through, we were heartened by how authors/contributors had responded to the invitation in artful, creative and imaginative ways.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we report on the cross-cultural comparative analysis that was undertaken as part of the Social Unit of Learning project investigating student collaborative problem solving in China and Australia. The video-based research examined the ‘negotiative foci’ of dyadic student interaction during collaborative problem solving within the mathematics classroom setting. In the analysis we take negotiative focus as the central construct and compare the student interactions in terms of their focus on either facts and procedures, didactical norms, or social/interpersonal considerations. We report on the analysis based on an open-ended pair task (Household task) that was completed by year 7 students (mostly 12- to 13-year olds) in China and Australia. In the study we analysed the video and written responses of 20 student pairs from three year 7 classes in China (40 students in total) and 25 student pairs from two year 7 classes in Australia (50 students in total). The findings from this comparative study provide empirical evidence regarding how the participating students in each country interpreted and negotiated meaning as they tackled the open-ended task collaboratively.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>While patterning was commonly seen as evidence of mathematical thinking, interdisciplinary interest has recently increased due to pattern-recognition applications in artificial intelligence. Within two empirical studies, we analyze the analogical-transfer capability of primary school students when completing three types of bi-dimensional patterns, namely, numerical, discrete geometric, and continuous geometric. We found that the mechanisms involved in analogical transfer for continuing sequential patterns are based on two complementary cognitive processes: decoding and adapting. In addition, at a basic level of processing, students activate one of the operational tools of shape recognition or counting, and based on it, they find a surface analogy that leads them to use isometric transformations or one-dimensional development for continuing the given pattern. At a more complex level of processing, students activate both shape recognition and counting and are thus able to apply a filter of processing that uncovers a deep-structure analogy, which allows cognitive framing of the problem and leads to coherent 2D developments within the understood conceptual frame. At a more advanced level of processing, students can use a refined filter not only to uncover a deep-structure analogy but also to use an external language to verbalize that analogy, and consequently, to find 2D developments that trigger changes in cognitive framing, showing that pattern generation is a creative activity. Teaching and learning implications are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In response to recent trends in the field of mathematics education, real-world contexts are frequently found in curricula and classrooms across the world. Numerous scholars contend that, in addition to making instruction more engaging and relevant, rich, imaginable contexts can provide a semantic grounding that helps students deeply understand abstract mathematical ideas. To achieve this form of understanding, A. Thompson et al. (1994) describe the need for conceptually oriented teaching, aimed at supporting students in maintaining connection between numerical values and operations and the quantities and relationships to which they refer. We elaborate the construct of conceptually oriented teaching through an empirical analysis of two teachers’ instruction around a context-based ratio instructional sequence. More specifically, we differentiate between two types of explicit contextualization present within conceptually oriented explanations: contextualized quantities and contextualized operating. We identify the importance of a particular teacher move, pressing for contextualized operating, that aims to explicitly ground students’ use of representations to their common sense understanding of the problem context. We describe two ways that the teachers work to make the contextualization explicit in the classroom discourse and argue that this explicit contextualization is essential in order for all students to have the opportunity to experience the contexts as supportive of conceptual development.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The way individuals interpret and reinterpret their experience is central to meaning-making and impacts teaching and learning. Grounded in Mezirow’s transformative learning theory, this research explores whether pandemic-related emergency remote teaching manifested as a “disorienting dilemma” for technology educators. Teachers negotiated curricular outcomes between physical aspects of making and doing, as well as creative problem solving through design, resulting in a pandemic transformed pedagogy. Thematic analysis revealed that making and doing was severely challenged due to decreased communication, student motivation, and engagement. However, most concerning to educators was the heightened disparity in equity and access in their most vulnerable and at-risk students. In conditions of fear and trauma, little is known about the impact a chaotic way of being has on learners and educators. While we cannot predict what the “new normal” will look like for schools, and what the long-term effects of emergency remote teaching will be, our research demonstrates that the disorienting dilemma COVID-19 presents will continue to shape the pandemic transformed pedagogy of technology educators.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are important at most colleges and universities. One purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which motivational climate was associated with SETs. Another purpose was to determine whether course ease was associated with SETs. Participants included 2,949 undergraduate students from 30 courses at a large public university. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined the extent to which students’ motivation-related course perceptions (empowerment/autonomy, usefulness, success expectancies, situational interest, and caring) related to SETs at the student and class levels. SETs were highly associated with motivational climate. Furthermore, easier courses were rated lower by students when controlling for motivational climate and the demographical composition of the class. These findings highlight the association between the motivational climate and SETs and suggest that one way to improve SETs may be for instructors to focus on improving the motivational climate rather than making the course easier.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>American states have used different approaches in adoption of cannabis policies and continue to modify those policies after approval. States also differ in how long it takes to implement such policies, and this influences the availability of legal marijuana. Such policy differences and implementation timelines could influence usage of marijuana and other illicit drugs by adolescents, young adults, and older adults. We develop an original coding scheme for marijuana legalization policies by classifying policy bundles characterized by three views of marijuana: as a pharmaceutical; as a permissive drug, or as a state fiscal revenue source. We test the impact of state legal marijuana policy characteristics on age group rates of marijuana use with panel regression models including control variables and fixed effects for 2000–2019. This design moves beyond a dichotomous construct of marijuana legalization and accounts for the dynamic adaptation of policies beyond their initial adoption. States with a higher pharmaceutical score experienced lower marijuana usage rates for adolescents and young adults while states with a permissive approach or fiscal approach experienced higher rates of marijuana use for all age groups. We find no consistent spillover effect of the pharmaceutical or permissive marijuana policy bundles on other illicit drug use for any age group, but fiscal bundles show some association with greater illicit drug use for adults. These more nuanced measures better reflect state policies as implemented and provide more clarity of the policy impact on target populations’ marijuana usage.

  Abstract
                  <p>Over the past decade, teaching mathematics ambitiously has received increased attention. In this paper, we argue that to materialize this vision in contemporary classes we need to understand how practicing teachers experiment with certain aspects of this teaching and what challenges they encounter. Toward this end, we focus on an aspect of teaching ambitiously—designing and using enablers and extenders—and examine how four elementary schoolteachers experimented with it in their practice while also participating in a video-club setting. Drawing on a corpus of data including lesson plans, videotaped lessons, pre- and post-lesson interviews, end-of-program interviews, and videotaped video-club sessions, and looking across the four cases, we sketch how these teachers worked with enablers and extenders and the challenges they faced. Our analysis helped identify certain components entailed in working with enablers and extenders during the phases of lesson planning and enactment; it also yielded a classification of observed and reported challenges encountered as teachers engage with this work. This mapping of work associated with designing and using enablers and extenders, along with the classification of challenges generated, can inform professional learning development attempts aiming to support teachers enact ambitious teaching by identifying and naming separate components of practice that merit consideration and by providing insights into the types of scaffolds needed to support teachers in teaching ambitiously.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>While educators’ uses of social media for purposes such as professional learning and networking are now well-established, our understanding of how educational institutions use social media—including to engage key stakeholders during periods of crisis—is limited. In this study, we used a public data mining research approach to examine how K–12 school districts in the United States used Twitter as a communication tool during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic, March-April, 2020. Through a three-step grounded theory approach of 1,357 district tweets from 492 school districts, we found that districts worked to build community and share time-sensitive announcements in alignment with social media crisis communication recommendations. Announcements were more common during the early stages of the pandemic (and were engaged more collaboratively), with community-building posts more common later on. This study demonstrates how researchers can use publicly available (social media) data to understand districts’ communication priorities and strategies during and beyond periods of crisis.

We learned that many of the participants in our study were hired to teach race and racism among race-evasive colleagues and predominantly white students that are enabled to protect and leverage their whiteness. As we frame their experiences, we argue that teacher education programs are, in fact, structured for teacher educators of Color to experience racial stress and harm. We end by suggesting steps teacher education programs can take to advance racial justice.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Policymaking is not linear or neutral, nor is it ever made or enacted in isolation, especially not during a crisis. Framed by theories on the contextual, interactive nature of policy enactment, this year-long, ethnographic study examined how an urban elementary school and nonprofit organization worked to address challenges made visible by the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses explored how negotiations among the school, its nonprofit partner, and district shaped pandemic policy responses. Data included 35 transcriptions and eight field notes from stakeholder interviews and principal–partner meetings, and 128 external stakeholder artifacts. Findings showcase the policy enactment of family–school communication and access to remote learning, and limitations of the partnership due to structural and racialized processes. The discussion presents implications for educational policymaking in response to crises, highlighting the need to understand the external contexts and racialized discourses that are part of shaping those responses to be dynamic and “nonlinear.”

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Resource exposure was a key mechanism linking patterns of racial segregation and student outcomes during the Brown v. Board of Education era. Decades later, past progress on school desegregation may have stalled, raising concerns about resource equity and associated student outcomes. Are recent trends in segregation associated with racial disparities in district revenue? Drawing on national data from the School Funding Fairness Data System and the Common Core of Data, this study examines the association between contemporary patterns of segregation between districts within a state and racial disparities in school district revenue over time. We find that increases in racial segregation, net of racial socioeconomic segregation, and other racial differences between districts are associated with racial disparities in revenue.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past three decades, children from low-income families have increasingly been attending different public schools than those from more affluent families. Though recent work has helped us understand patterns of income segregation between districts and schools within districts, we know little about segregation of students as they experience school: in the classroom. We attempt to advance knowledge of segregation of students by income at the classroom level. We use data from North Carolina that includes information on classroom assignments and students’ economically disadvantaged (ED) status. We assess whether ED students are clustered/segregated into different classrooms than other students. We find that within-school segregation rose by about 10% between 2007 and 2014 in elementary and middle schools we study.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In 2021, only a few locally led peacebuilding institutions worked to build bridges across the Armenian–Azerbaijani conflict that had divided the two societies for over three decades. This stood in sharp contrast with the recent past, when the environment was saturated by civil society institutions promoting peace and cross-border co-operation. The reasons for the dissipation of the once-vibrant scene of institutionalized peacebuilding included the decreased European and US support for democratization and civil society, the crackdown on and stigmatization of peacebuilding, military escalation, and the Second Karabakh War. The collapse of the professionalized scene, however, was not the end of peacebuilding. As institutions retreated, decentralized online networks connecting Armenians and Azerbaijanis sprang into existence. The article explores the journey of Caucasus Edition, a peacebuilding journal, whose ongoing reflection and action cycle process led it to transform from a professional institution into a decentralized transnational network. It highlights the relative effectiveness of decentralized structures, particularly their resiliency and adaptability, compared to professionalized civil society institutions susceptible to cooptation or crackdown in non-democratic political environments.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The use of vlogs is promising in participatory action research (PAR) that aims to enhance the health and well-being of citizens. Vlogs have the potential to reach a wide audience, transcending the local scale of PAR. This article aims to explore the value of co-creating vlogs by investigating two exploratory studies involving adolescents and women from disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We reflected on the co-creation of vlogs by community members and professionals. The results show that co-creating vlogs enabled meaningful engagement of citizens living in vulnerable circumstances and promoted shared learning. Community members who were not involved in the vlog creation were critical of the vlogs. However, watching the vlogs stimulated discussion and reflection. Therefore, dissemination of vlogs in a setting guided by a professional seems to have the potential to facilitate shared learning. Despite the popularity of vlogs, this study highlights the need to carefully consider the use of vlogs in relation to a study’s aims and to respond to (ethical) concerns.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Antiblack geopolitics and educational policies continue to produce oppressive systems, making it difficult for educators to acknowledge Black families’ actions as contributions to produce equitable education. Policy processes have the potential to transform oppressive systems of power. Conceptualizing policy as a practice of power permits local policy actors to use their individualized power to shift a policy’s course of action and transform oppressive educational systems. With an anticolonial framework and using an institutional ethnography, this inquiry explores Black mothers’ actions as policy actors. Findings detail the mothers’ relentless invitation to allow their darkskinned agentic power to collaborate with their school district and form a teacher-recruitment program. The mothers’ policy actions are exemplary of the abilities to transform policy processes ridden with antiblack geopolitics that ignore the voices of BIPOC individuals. This project illustrates the daily antiblackness individuals endure before and while enlisting as educational partners and policy actors.
