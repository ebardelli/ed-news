  Abstract
                  <p>The article introduces a mathematics education measure in response to the COVID-19 epidemic in China and explores students’ degree of approval and perception of digital equity towards the response. After the outbreak of the COVID-19, the Chinese New Century Primary School Mathematics Textbook (NCPM) committee had developed a series of micro classes (abbreviated as NCPM micro classes), and more than 25 million teachers and students in China watched the NCPM micro classes during the 3 months social isolation. Then, students’ degree of approval towards the NCPM micro classes and perception of digital equity were examined after social isolation. A total of 132,740 pieces of data were collected from Chinese primary school students. Quantitative analysis of student’s degree of approval towards different parts of NCPM micro classes indicated that the introduction, interaction, summary and consolidation, curriculum characteristics, and goal achievement parts of the NCPM micro classes have received high approval from students, and students with higher former achievement perceived a higher degree of approval towards the NCPM micro classes. Furthermore, we found that gender, socioeconomic status, school location, and learning location had no significant impact on students’ degree of approval, indicating a digital equity exists. This study helps researchers or educators understand the mathematics education response to the COVID-19 outbreak in China and extends our understanding of primary students’ degree of approval and perception of digital equity with these online classes.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The theoretical reflection on the nature of school algebra and the development of algebraic thinking from the first educational levels is a relevant topic in mathematics education. In this paper, we first summarize and clarify the positions held on this topic by two theoretical frameworks: the Theory of Objectification and the Onto-semiotic Approach. We identify concordances and complementarities in the respective conceptions of algebra and of the processes of developing algebraic thinking, as a result of applying these frameworks to analyse some students’ responses to a task on numerical patterns. We also analyse and compare the didactic models proposed in both theoretical frameworks for developing algebraic thinking. The analysis of the algebraic thinking and learning episodes is also used to illustrate a general discussion on the identity and boundaries of these theoretical frameworks and the possibilities of coordination and integration.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Our research involves interacting with students and teachers through Teaching Experiments conducted in mathematics classes. The core scientific objectives of our work are to study the mathematical strategies used by students and the meaning they associate with the concepts at stake. Our interest in students’ comprehension of and approaches to their mathematics work requires that we continuously take into account the mathematics they produce in class so we can understand their methods and discover their underlying meanings. During a recent project carried out over the course of a school year, teachers from the primary and secondary classes that participated in the study spontaneously and repeatedly commented on the positive impact of our work on class dynamics: it created an environment that stimulated students’ mathematical work and fostered their sustained engagement. Although this was initially outside the scientific scope of our study, the significance and frequency of these comments from teachers caught our attention. This article describes the impact, or collateral outcomes, that our Teaching Experiments had on students and the classroom environment. Following a description of the scientific parameters guiding our research, we identify the scientific and epistemological foundations grounding our work. We then provide a detailed analysis of the collateral outcomes of our approach as expressed in the teachers’ statements. From this analysis emerges the theoretical concept of kindness, which offers a conceptualization of how our Teaching Experiments impact students, the classroom environment and the mathematics performed therein. Studying outcomes through the lens of kindness leads us to propose the notion of didactic kindness, as one that focuses on students’ progress in their mathematic abilities in class.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Over the past decade, initiatives around the world have introduced computing into K–12 education under the umbrella of computational thinking. While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K–12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K–12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.

  Abstract
                  <p>Models-and-modeling perspective (MMP) is a problem-solving and learning perspective in mathematics education. Although modeling processes have been addressed widely in the international discussion on mathematical modeling, a homogeneous understanding has not been established yet. Hence, the field needs studies addressing the epistemological grounds of model development. Therefore, in this study, I aimed to scrutinize the latent aspects of modeling in MMP-based research. Based on the analysis of 143 chapter-sized documents, I aimed to articulate the characteristics of the modeling process and the models. The thematic analysis that was incorporated in document analysis revealed four latent aspects, namely, modeling (1) is a subjective and also inter- and intra-subjective process, (2) encompasses both structural and systematic properties, (3) produces models that are both implicit and explicit to a certain degree, and (4) culminates in an incomplete — but not inadequate — model. These aspects of model development led me to reconceptualize what a model conveys in MMP-based research and articulate the potential and limits of the models. This is particularly important for teachers and researchers in understanding what models indicate in relation to students’ ways of thinking, and such a systematic and analytical investigation can contribute to the scholarly conversation about modeling in the field of mathematics education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In mathematics education, the research on proof by contradiction (PBC) often claims that this activity is more difficult for students than direct proof, or simply difficult in general. Many hypotheses have been offered to support or explain this belief, yet they span a disorientingly wide swath of journal articles, conference papers, dissertations, book chapters, etc. In addition, few attempts have been made to organize these hypotheses or carefully test them. In this paper, we conduct a thorough literature review on PBC, organize existing hypotheses about challenges with PBC into a Hypothesis Framework for (Students’ Difficulty with) Proof By Contradiction (HFPBC), discuss the state of research related to each hypothesis, and offer thoughts on the future study of these hypotheses.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Proficiency in oral communication is an important skill to develop in science. Central to its development is self-efficacy. In this study we examine two aspects of self-efficacy: first, standards and content, and second, showmanship. We looked at these aspects among students enrolled in a natural sciences program at the Quebec collège level (a two-year post-secondary program in which students are usually between the ages of 17 and 19) in relation to their experiences of oral communication on scientific subjects. A sample of students responded to a questionnaire developed as part of this study on perceptions and attitudes towards communicating orally in the sciences (PACOS), first at the start of their program (n = 1292) and then at the end (n = 179). A subsample of this group (n = 26) also participated in an interview for deeper analysis. The results, coupled with those from a previous study, show that the two aforementioned aspects of self-efficacy are distinct but complementary. Moreover, we observed that they are linked to other subcomponents of one’s attitude towards scientific oral communication—namely anxiety, pleasure, perception of relevance, and context. Finally, we noted that the standards and content aspect of self-efficacy remained consistent over time, while the sense of showmanship increased among participants between the start and end of their studies.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>With the recent escalation in interior immigration enforcement across the United States, immigrant and U.S.-born children are increasingly exposed to coercive measures that have been shown to disrupt their development. This study examines the relationship between immigration-related arrests and the educational outcomes of Hispanics—a group that is overwhelmingly targeted by immigration authorities. Using data on the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level, we estimate the impact of immigration enforcement on Hispanics’ school enrollment. We find that increases in the arrest rate are accompanied by substantial declines in enrollment among Hispanic youth, including U.S.-born, foreign-born, and individuals in mixed-status families. Additionally, we do not find evidence of this relationship among other racial/ethnic groups, suggesting that the impact is concentrated among Hispanic individuals. Our results advance our understanding of the unintended consequences of immigration enforcement on educational outcomes and show that ethnicity is a crucial factor in this process.

Given that schools are intended to be purveyors of democratic values, schools represent an ideal context to examine how immigration and legal status are considered in a community that aims to support the academic and social success of all students This study investigates how members of an urban, K–12 school community in California addressed immigration issues over nearly a decade-long period. The study details three ways in which the school addressed immigration status issues across time. They include college-going supports, addressing newcomer/unaccompanied students’ needs, and delivery of legal services. The study’s implications highlight how K–12 schools can address immigration issues in intentional, ethical, and supportive ways.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We explored the COVID-19 pandemic as a context for learning about the role of science in a global health crisis. In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic-related lockdown, we worked with a high school teacher to design and implement a unit on human brain and behavior science. The unit guided her 17 students in creating studies that explored personally relevant questions about the pandemic to contribute to a citizen science platform. Pre-/postsurveys, student artifacts, and student and teacher interviews showed increases in students’ fascination with science—a driver of engagement and career preference—and sense of agency as citizen scientists. Students approached science as a tool for addressing their pandemic-related concerns but were hampered by the challenges of remote schooling. These findings highlight both the opportunities of learning from a global crisis, and the need to consider how that crisis is still affecting learners.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>How does live instruction relate to student engagement in distance learning? Does the relationship differ across grade levels? This study addresses these questions by examining data from a random sample of families from a large urban school district in southern California. We find a strong correlation between live instruction and student engagement in online learning among elementary school students, with every additional hour of live instruction per week increasing the probability of reporting that students have completed all their schoolwork by 26%. The correlation is also significant though smaller in magnitude for middle and high school students.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>With the goal of informing federal and state policy makers in a time of budget constraints, we used a systematic review methodology to identify and summarize findings from studies that examined the effects of losing grant aid due to policy changes and students’ failure to meet renewal requirements. Studies reviewed in this policy brief show negative effects on student outcomes when grant aid is reduced or eliminated. While results vary, this general conclusion applies when grant aid is reduced or eliminated from programs that differ in scope (federal and state), eligibility requirements (merit and need), and award amounts. This brief illuminates the importance of maintaining grant aid funding for college student enrollment, persistence, achievement, and completion. Especially in context of other pandemic-related stressors, reducing need-based grant aid will likely exacerbate declines in college enrollment, progression through college, and degree completion for vulnerable students.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Many prominent social scientists have advocated for random-draw lotteries as a solution to the “problem” of elite college admissions. They argue that lotteries will be fair, equitable, eliminate corruption, reduce student anxiety, restore democratic ideals, and end debates over race-conscious admissions. In response, we simulate potential lottery effects on student enrollment by race, gender, and income, using robust simulation methods and multiple minimum thresholds for grades and standardized tests. In the overwhelming majority of lottery simulations, the proportions of low-income students and students of color drop precipitously. With a GPA minimum, we find the proportion of men could drop as low as one third. Admissions lotteries with minimum bars for GPA and/or standardized tests do not appear to produce more equitable outcomes.

Controlling for demographics, teachers’ hours decreased early in the pandemic, but throughout the 2020–2021 school year teachers have been working more than usual. The increase is slightly more pronounced for veteran teachers and for females. The findings emphasize the increased demands of the teaching profession during the global pandemic.

These developments invite a number of legal questions about the legality of mask mandates (and bans on those mandates).

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 22-27, November 2021. <br>The education model in which a single teacher instructs a single classroom of students has been remarkably persistent, but teacher shortages, low morale, and poor teacher retention are signs that it’s not working well for teachers. Ray Reutzel and Parker Fawson describe how Utah’s Center for the School of the Future is seeking to redesign the teacher workforce to improve outcomes for both teachers and students without increasing costs. Their integrated workforce model brings students together in a pod led by a master teacher, classroom teachers, teacher interns, aides, and tutors. Students receive more individualized support, and prospective teachers have more opportunities to practice their skills before receiving a license and becoming a lead teacher. The model also includes pathways for paraprofessionals to complete education coursework while they continue to earn an income.
