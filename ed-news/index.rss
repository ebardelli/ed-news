        <title>The MTSK model as a tool for designing tasks for teacher education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper studies the knowledge developed by a group of sixty-two pre-service primary teachers during a training session on the definition of a polygon and the mathematical practice of defining. We explore the knowledge developed by pre-service teachers when they carry out a series of training tasks oriented around the practice of defining with primary pupils, within the theoretical framework of the Mathematics Teachers’ Specialised Knowledge model, and using videos of an authentic lesson as prompt. Data were collected by means of video recordings of the implementation of the training tasks, in conjunction with the pre-service teachers’ own written observations as they watched the recorded lesson. A content analysis was carried out on the collected data using the Mathematics Teachers’ Specialised Knowledge model. The results highlight the way in which knowledge of the mathematical practice of defining is constructed, along with the mathematical objects involved in this practice, and pedagogical aspects of defining with young pupils. They also illustrate how a sequence of tasks oriented around a model of teachers’ knowledge can contribute to the development of this knowledge in initial training programmes, and more especially provide orientation about the training of pre-service teachers in the mathematical practice of defining.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rethinking anti-Asian racism in mathematics education: the hidden racism made visible through AsianCrit</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Racism against Asians is often ignored worldwide, and the field of mathematics education is no exception. The anti-Asian racism unveiled during the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates that we rethink the current discussions of equity and social justice in mathematics education regarding how the needs of many Asian students have been forgotten and often excluded from these discussions. When Asian students are mentioned, it is often for the purpose of reifying a racial hierarchy of mathematical ability (Martin, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teachers College Record&lt;/em&gt; 111(2):295–338, 2009; Martin et al., 2017). Based on an analysis of the particularities of the U.S. context, this essay argues that the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;model minority myth&lt;/em&gt; and other covert forms of anti-Asian racism, such as yellow peril and forever foreigner myths, racialize Asian Americans and create a monolithic view of diverse groups of people with different histories and needs, including within mathematics education. While incorporating current race and racism concepts from Asian Critical Theory (Iftikar &amp;amp; Museus, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;International Journal of Qualitative Studies in Education&lt;/em&gt; 31(10):935–949, 2018), we aim to conceptualize the racialization that Asian-American students experience in mathematics classrooms and how it affects their well-being, and propose implications to (re)construct Asian-American students’ counterstories and identities in mathematics education. We also scrutinize mathematics education researchers’ and educators’ roles in advancing equity for all students by countering the hidden racism toward Asian Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating a space for them through autoethnography</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Researchers in education have begun to address inclusivity for gender-diverse populations, but the authentic experiences of gender-variant students presented directly by the students themselves are largely unheard in the literature of mathematics education. In this co-authored report, we include the experiences of a genderqueer preservice mathematics teacher over the course of a semester at university through their autoethnography and the reflections of a mathematics teacher educator supervising the research. Through this study, we provide educators a window into some ways that gender-variant students may experience the classroom and academia. One goal of this research is to create a space for the authentic voice of gender-variant individuals in the discussion of gender-inclusive education. We highlight implications for mathematics teacher educators involving gender-variant students’ gender journeys as processes instead of moments of coming out, the interdependent process of building relationships of trust, and the importance of trying and failing and trying again as we seek to be more inclusive educators.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Student Interpretations of Eigenequations in Linear Algebra and Quantum Mechanics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This work investigates how students interpret various eigenequations in different contexts for &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(2 \times 2\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; matrices: &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq2&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(A\vec {x}=\lambda \vec {x}\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; in mathematics and either &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq3&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\hat{S}_x| + \rangle _x=\frac{\hbar }{2}| + \rangle _x\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq4&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\hat{S}_z| + \rangle =\frac{\hbar }{2}| + \rangle\)&lt;/span&gt;
                    
                  &lt;/span&gt; in quantum mechanics. Data were collected from two sources in a senior-level quantum mechanics course; one is video, transcript and written work of individual, semi-structured interviews; the second is written work from the same course three years later. We found two principal ways in which students reasoned about the equal sign within the mathematics eigenequation and at times within the quantum mechanical eigenequations: with a functional interpretation and/or a relational interpretation. Second, we found three distinct ways in which students explained how they made sense of the physical meaning conveyed by the quantum mechanical eigenequations: via a measurement interpretation, potential measurement interpretation, or correspondence interpretation of the equation. Finally, we present two themes that emerged in the ways that students compared the different eigenequations: attention to form and attention to conceptual (in)compatibility. These findings are discussed in relation to relevant literature, and their instructional implications are also explored.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transitioning to proof via writing scripts on the rules of a new discourse﻿</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Coming from the commognitive standpoint, we consider proof-based mathematics as a distinct discourse, the transition to which requires special rules for endorsement and rejection of mathematical statements. In this study, we investigate newcomers’ learning of these rules when being taught them explicitly. Our data come from academically motivated high-school students who took a special course in undergraduate mathematics. The course teacher dedicated three academic hours to introducing and explaining selected rules of proof to support students’ shift to the new discourse. The homework assignment consisted of typical proof-requiring problems and a scriptwriting task, asking students to compose a dialogue between fictional characters about a proof-related mistake of their choice. We analyzed the differences and similarities between the rules discussed in the classroom and those that students addressed and implemented in their proofs. The analysis showed that while students’ solutions to proof-requiring problems required rule implementation, fictitious dialogues opened the space for rule formulation and substantiation. In many cases, the students discussed the rules presented in the classroom, extending, elaborating, and specifying the teacher’s formulations. Furthermore, while the students’ proofs were mainly consistent with the teacher’s expectations, some of their rule formulations were more radical and overgeneralized than expected. These findings suggest that newcomers’ communication about the rules of proof may lag behind their capability to implement those rules to prove mathematical statements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creativity-Fostering Teacher Behaviors in Higher Education: A Transdisciplinary Systematic Literature Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While society’s demand for creativity is echoed across the world, teachers in higher education often struggle to support students’ development of creative competencies. This transdisciplinary systematic literature review of 58 peer-reviewed empirical studies provides a comprehensive overview of creativity-fostering teacher behaviors identified across all academic disciplines in higher education. In our thematic analysis, we identified 22 themes grouped into six overarching dimensions (the six dimensions of fostering creativity, namely, [a] affective, [b] cognitive, [c] behavioral, [d] metacognitive, [e] creativity-in-action, and [f] uncertainty). Based on these dimensions, we developed a new conceptual model of teacher behaviors for creativity: the “meta-creativity” model. This model highlights the transdisciplinary, interactive, and interdependent nature of creativity-fostering teacher behaviors, which are subject to the conflicting needs and tensions of creative processes. This review provides key practical insights for teachers, administrators, and policymakers and new research directions for a more holistic approach to teaching for creativity.

        <title>Developmental Education for College Students with Learning and Attention Disabilities</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As postsecondary developmental education policy reforms are implemented, increased attention must be given to students with learning and attention disabilities. The purpose of this study was to bring these students into the conversation, by examining their representation in developmental education broadly, as well the effect of this intervention on their college persistence and credit accumulation. Results show students with learning or attention disabilities are overrepresented in developmental education and could experience heterogenous effects on their postsecondary outcomes. Policymakers should be purposeful about consideration of this growing group of students in continued developmental education reforms.

        <title>Using critical incidents as a tool for promoting prospective teachers’ noticing during reflective discussions in a fieldwork-based university course</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Preparing prospective mathematics teachers to become teachers who recognize and respond to students’ mathematical needs is challenging. In this study, we use the construct of critical incident as a tool to support prospective mathematics teachers’ reflection on their authentic fieldwork activities, notice students’ thinking, and link it to the complexity of mathematics teaching. Particularly, we aim to explore the characteristics and evolution of prospective mathematics teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking when critical incidents trigger reflective discussions. Critical incidents are moments in which students’ mathematical thinking becomes apparent and can provide teachers with opportunities to delve more deeply into the mathematics discussed in the lesson. In the study, twenty-two prospective mathematics teachers participated in fieldwork activities that included observing and teaching secondary school classrooms. The prospective teachers identified critical incidents from their observations and teaching, which were the foci for reflective discussion in university sessions. By characterizing the prospective teachers’ reflective talk in these discussions, we demonstrate the discussion’s evolution. In it, participants questioned learning and teaching mathematics and suggested alternate explanations. This characterization also shows that using critical incidents in the university discussions enabled the prospective teachers to link students’ thinking with the teacher’s teaching practices while supporting their reflection using classroom evidence. We emphasize the importance of descriptive talk in the discussion, which allows for deepening the prospective teachers’ reflections. Further, we explore the teacher educator’s contributions in those discussions, showing that the teacher educator mainly maintained the reflective talk by contextualizing the critical incidents and pressing the participants to explain further issues they raised in the discussions. Implications for mathematics teacher education are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why ask why? An analysis of teachers’ why-questions in elementary and middle grade mathematics classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teacher questioning serves a crucial role in creating classrooms where students’ mathematical reasoning is centered. Generally, why-questions are positioned as powerful tools to probe student thinking and engage students in mathematical argumentation. Yet, in our recent research we found that why-questions did not serve to differentiate traditional classrooms from those with a focus on justification and explanation. In this study, we investigated how linguistically similarly why-questions may operate differently. We leveraged disparate literature bases to frame the ambiguity of why-questions and analyzed a set of 61 lessons representing three school districts and spanning grades four through eight. We found that expected student responses to why-questions ranged from a recalled fact to rich justification depending on a number of contextual features. These differences in why-questions accounted for significant variation in student activity in lessons. We suggest that mathematics teacher educators similarly problematize why-questions in order to maximize their potential.&lt;/p&gt;

            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;When it comes to understanding the consequences of school absenteeism, how missing school might be linked to student-teacher relationships remains relatively unexplored. Our work helps to further detail this context by specifically investigating whether teachers’ perceptions of students are different based on how frequently those students are absent. We explore this in early elementary school—a period marked by high rates of student absenteeism not witnessed again until early adolescence. Using a nationally representative dataset of children in kindergarten through second grade, we found that teachers felt less close with students who had more absences compared to students with fewer absences. Findings also suggested teachers had lower perceptions of absent students’ classroom social skills compared to the perceptions that they held for less-absent students. Finally, teachers had lower ratings of learning approaches as well as lower ratings of language and math abilities for students who were more absent. Recommendations for policy and practice are discussed.

        <title>Does Universal SEL Promote Academic Success? Examining Learner Outcomes Under Routine Conditions in First-Grade Classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Although proponents suggest that universal social-emotional learning (SEL) programs promote academic achievement, few studies have directly tested these outcomes under routine conditions in schools. Forty first-grade classrooms participated in an effectiveness trial in which schools (N = 13) were randomly assigned to implementation of a universal SEL program (SSIS SEL CIP) or control (business-as-usual practices) conditions within sites/regions. Teachers in the treatment condition prepared for and implemented the program in accordance with their typical local practices. There were no statistically significant main effects on teacher-rated student engagement, motivation, and academic skills. Effect sizes, however, were medium to large and positive for academic engaged time and math achievement. Students with lower teacher-rated academic motivation at pretest also were more likely to improve after program exposure. These findings help identify considerations for further studying the potential academic outcomes resulting from implementing universal SEL under typical conditions.

        <title>The Politics of School Funding: How State Political Ideology is Associated With the Allocation of Revenue to School Districts</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;States diverge widely when it comes to education funding choices, leading to substantial differences in how much states spend on schooling, the role of local versus state revenue sources, and relative differences among districts in funding levels. Prior studies have documented that Democratic party control of state governments appears to be associated with higher levels of spending on K-12 education, but beyond that we know little about how political ideology is related to patterns of education funding allocation by states. This study examines this question using a nationwide dataset of school district expenditures from 1999 to 2015. The results indicate that states that are more politically liberal tend to provide more funds (per pupil) to local districts. More liberal states also provide relatively more favorable distributions to districts that are more urban and have larger Black student populations, in addition to perhaps rewarding districts with higher local property tax rates.
