        <title>Student visual attention during group instruction phases in collaborative geometry problem solving</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teacher gestures support mathematics learning and promote student collaboration. Aligned with speech, gestures can help students to notice the important visual information of geometry tasks. However, students’ visual attention to the teacher’s gestural cues during collaborative problem solving remains a largely unexplored field in mathematics education research. This mixed-method case study investigated relations between students’ visual attention, teacher gestures, and students’ collaborative problem-solving process on a geometry task. The data were collected with video cameras and mobile gaze trackers on four students simultaneously in two Finnish 9th-grade mathematics lessons with the same teacher. The findings show that the students attended to their own papers most of the time during the teacher&#39;s gestures, but differences in student attention between the gesture types emerged. The qualitative analysis showed that the teacher’s tracing, pointing, and representational gestures helped in directing student attention to targets relevant to the situational learning process. We conclude that teacher gestures can both convey mathematical contents and direct student attention, which intermediates mathematical thinking in problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers’ Knowledge and Preparedness for Retirement: Results From a Nationally Representative Teacher Survey</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Adequately preparing for retirement requires planning and knowledge about available savings and investment options. Teachers participate in a complex set of plan designs, and many do not participate in Social Security. While teachers represent a large part of the public workforce, relatively little is known regarding their knowledge and preparation for retirement. We administered a survey to a nationally representative sample of teachers through RAND’s American Teacher Panel and asked teachers about their retirement planning and employer-sponsored retirement plans. We find that while most teachers are taking steps to prepare for retirement, many teachers do not currently possess the basic retirement knowledge necessary to plan effectively. Teachers struggled to identify their plan type, how much they contribute to their plans, retirement eligibility ages, and who contributes to Social Security. These results suggest that better education around teacher retirement plans has the potential to improve teachers’ retirement planning and preparation.

        <title>Introducing the role of being an advocate in mathematics teacher education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics teacher education is often described in terms of the mathematical content and pedagogy that teachers need. However, recent calls for equity in mathematics education demand a broadening of this view. In this article, we articulate a theoretical description of what the role of being an advocate in language-diverse classrooms could involve and some of the practical challenges that mathematics teacher educators may have when introducing it, using empirical examples from our teacher education courses for teachers of Grades 1–7 in Norway. In the theoretical description of the role of being an advocate into mathematics teacher education, we distinguish between in-class advocacy and advocacy beyond the classroom and what these different kinds of advocacy might entail in language-diverse classrooms. The practical issues that we identified in raising different aspects of the role indicate the need for further research into how to raise preservice teachers’ awareness about the role of being an advocate, in and outside of the classroom, in different cultural settings and how this knowledge could be used in teacher education to challenge preservice teachers’ language ideologies and raise non-trivial issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mathematical structures of simple and compound interest: An analysis of secondary teachers’ relational thinking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article proposes an in-depth mathematics analysis of simple and compound interest through an exploration of the mathematical structures underlying these concepts. Financial numeracy concepts (simple and compound interest, interest rates, interest period, present and future value, etc.) have been added to the mathematics curriculum of the Canadian province of Quebec in 2016. Yet, little is known with regards to mathematics teachers’ knowledge of financial concepts. We mobilized the relational paradigm framework in the context of simple and compound interest to construct an assessment instrument of teacher knowledge. Based on 36 teachers’ responses to the questionnaire, we observed that the majority of teachers did not use mathematical structures in problem solving; they were not able to make sense of simple and compound interest in ways that do not involve standard formulas. Such results indicate opportunities for professional development in regard to secondary mathematics teachers’ knowledge of mathematics in the context of simple and compound interest situations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“I’m a bit out of place here.”—Preservice teachers’ positioning in the figured world of university mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Preservice mathematics teachers are sometimes trained in programs so that they have both their own courses and joint courses with mathematics majors from the beginning of their studies. While this is thought to provide them with both deep mathematical knowledge and teaching-specific content right from the start, many of them report disaffection with and disengagement from mathematics during their very first semester. Current approaches often frame this from an individual’s perspective, investigating cognitive and affective individual differences among students. In contrast, we aim to understand this issue from a sociocultural perspective, examining underlying social processes. In this study, we thus explored preservice teachers’ experiences of the mathematics component of their training, using Holland and colleagues’ theory of figured worlds as a theoretical lens. Three group interviews with 14 preservice higher secondary teachers in a common mixed setting in Germany (one course specific to preservice teachers, one general mathematics course together with major students) were analyzed. Our findings displayed that the preservice teachers experienced two dichotomous figured worlds of mathematics and mathematics teaching. Our further analysis of their positioning between these worlds provided new insights to explain their disaffection, disengagement, and consequent learning behavior. We discuss practical implications, focusing on different teaching systems and interventions in teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Socio-ecological gestures of mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this theoretical article, we argue that the imminent collapse of earth systems that sustain life forms calls for mathematics education as a field to reflect on and re-evaluate its priorities and thus practices. We consider both what ecological collapse means for mathematics education and whether mathematics education might offer meaningful gestures in response. We explore how the relationship between the social and the ecological is conceptualised in mathematics education (and other relevant) research and what this implies for mathematics education. We read, in this scholarship, a growing focus on the ecological and conceptualisations of socio-ecological relations between existing entities that are dialectical, or mutually dependent. More rarely, are they seen as entangled and monist, and it is in this thought that we locate our contribution of multi-layered gestures of mathematics education. We describe these, in terms of three broad practices: listening for socio-ecological entanglement; attending to the scales of socio-ecological entanglements; and living entanglement as mathematics educators. We exemplify these gestures through examples of curriculum innovation. This article, a socio-ecological gesture in itself, is written in the spirit of opening a conversation into which we invite others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who benefits most from language-responsive learning materials in mathematics? Investigating differential effects in heterogeneous classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students’ proficiency in the language of instruction is essential for their mathematical learning. Accordingly, language-responsive instruction, which includes adapting teaching material to students’ language needs, is thought to promote mathematical learning, particularly for students with lower levels of proficiency in the language of instruction. However, empirical evidence for the effectiveness of this type of instruction in heterogeneous classrooms is scarce, and potential differential effects for learners with different learning prerequisites still need to be studied. The present study examines whether language-responsive instructional materials can promote students’ learning of fractions. We conducted a quasi-experimental intervention study with a pre- and posttest in Grade 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 211). The students were assigned to one of three instructional conditions: fraction instruction with or without additional language support or to a control group. The results showed that both intervention groups had higher learning gains than the control group. However, students with lower proficiency in the language of instruction benefited more from fraction instruction with additional language support than without it. The opposite was true for students with higher proficiency in the language of instruction. Moreover, learning gains depended on students’ levels of mathematics anxiety. Our study contributes to a more detailed understanding of the effectiveness of language-responsive instruction in heterogeneous classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating equal groups from n items: mathematical creativity in kindergarten</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines the solutions of 34 kindergarten children as they create equal groups from &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; bottle caps, where &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; was equal to 8, 9, 22, and 23. For each &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, children were asked to find as many different solutions as possible. The number of solutions they found, i.e., children’s fluency, as well as the strategies used to create equal groups, was analyzed. Findings indicated that for large numbers, fluency was greater for an even number of objects than for an odd number of objects. In general, most children reached only one solution. For all four tasks, most children created only two equal groups of caps, even though they could have created three groups or more. A significant association was found between tasks and a preferred strategy. While children employed between one and two strategies when working on a single task, when considering all four tasks, they generally employed between two and three strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Semiotic mediation of gestures in the teaching of early algebra: the case of the equal sign</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gestures are one of the ways in which mathematical cognition is embodied and have been elevated as a potentially important semiotic device in the teaching of mathematics. As such, a better understanding of gestures used during mathematics instruction (including frequency of use, types of gestures, how they are used, and the possible relationship between gestures and student performance) would inform mathematics education. We aim to understand teachers’ gestures in the context of early algebra, particularly in the teaching of the equal sign. Our findings suggest that the equal sign is a relatively rich environment for gestures, which are used in a variety of ways. Participating teachers used gestures frequently to support their teaching about the equal sign. Furthermore, the use of gestures varied depending on the particular conception of the equal sign the instruction aimed to promote. Finally, teacher gesture use in this context is correlated with students’ high performance on an early algebra assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evolution of teachers’ professional learning when using a technological resource: a case study of a Tunisian primary school teacher</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;While numerous studies have investigated teachers’ professional learning through their interaction with resources, the question of how teachers’ knowledge evolves at different stages of the instructional process remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article builds on the documentational approach to didactics (DAD) and the theory of instrumental orchestration to investigate teachers’ professional learning in terms of document development through their interaction with resources in and out of class. To this end, the paper proposes a theoretical and methodological model to analyze the evolution of a document, focusing on the joint evolution of utilization schemes and professional situations. This model provides analytical tools to track the development of teachers’ professional knowledge. The theoretical and methodological model was applied to a case study involving a Tunisian primary school teacher who used the technological resource GeoGebra for the first time to introduce the properties of parallelograms to 6th grade students (aged 11–12). Findings suggest the relevance and operationality of the proposed model,  through a short-term analysis of documentational genesis, to track the evolution of the teacher’s professional knowledge related to the use of GeoGebra in class. This model can be considered as a theoretical and methodological contribution, deepening the understanding of teachers’ professional learning when using technological resources and providing insights into the dynamic nature of teachers’ professional knowledge development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Profiles of teachers’ expertise in professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study contributes to the growing body of research that highlights the usefulness of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking for understanding the complexity and variability in teaching expertise. We explored the noticing expertise of 72 upper elementary school teachers engaged in multi-year professional development focused on children’s fraction thinking. Our assessment addressed the three component skills of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking: (a) attending to children’s strategy details, (b) interpreting children’s understandings, and (c) deciding how to respond on the basis of children’s understandings. We used a latent class analysis to empirically identify three distinct “profiles” of noticing expertise—subgroups of teachers who responded similarly to each other and differently from teachers in other profiles. The profiles differed in their overall noticing expertise as well as their patterns of strengths and areas for growth across the component skills. Thus, the profiles provide a concise, multi-dimensional characterization of noticing expertise that integrates expertise in each of the component skills. The profiles also provide tools for differentiating learning opportunities for teachers in professional development. In addition, our design allowed us to compare teachers’ expertise in two common forms of deciding how to respond: deciding on follow-up questions and deciding on next problems. In all three profiles, teachers demonstrated more expertise when deciding on follow-up questions than when deciding on next problems, suggesting not only a starting point for teacher learning but also the need for a line of research focused on different forms of this component skill.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Documenting two emerging sociomathematical norms for examining functions in mathematics teachers’ online asynchronous discussions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigated novice mathematics teachers participating in an online teacher education course focused on covariational reasoning and understanding the behavior of functions. The analysis centered on documenting the emergence of participants’ sociomathematical norms for engaging in online asynchronous discussions. In this paper, we characterized participants’ initial mathematical discourse and documented two emergent sociomathematical norms, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;explaining why&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;emergent shape discourse&lt;/em&gt;. When participants &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;explained why&lt;/em&gt;, they used specific quantities or symbolic representations of functions to justify why function graphs have particular visual features. When participants engaged in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;emergent shape discourse&lt;/em&gt;, they coordinated change between covarying quantities to justify why function graphs behave in certain ways. This study provides evidence that online settings can provide context for mathematics teachers engaging in legitimate collaborative mathematical activity and that activity can be enhanced by participation in discourse featuring specific sociomathematical norms. We discuss conjectures regarding the potential of reflective discussion activities paired with the Notice and Wonder Framework to support the emergence of generative sociomathematical norms. We also discuss potential relationships between characteristics of participants’ mathematical discourse and their membership with the core and periphery of a social network.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preservice elementary teachers’ mathematical achievement and attitudes: A study of blended learning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The primary purpose of this quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was to examine whether a blended learning approach was more effective than traditional face-to-face instruction in improving the mathematical achievement and attitudes of preservice elementary teachers. The secondary purpose was to determine what specific features of blended learning were deemed most helpful to prospective teachers’ learning of mathematics. Sixty-three prospective teachers participated in a foundational mathematics course in either a face-to-face (F2F) traditional or blended learning format. At pre- and post-test, participants completed a researcher-developed mathematics achievement test and the Dutton’s Attitude Scale (Dutton in ESJ 68:259–264, 1968) . Blended learning participants also completed a post-course researcher-developed questionnaire on their perceptions of blended learning. Results indicated that participants who were enrolled in the blended learning format had significantly better attitudes at post-test than teachers in the F2F format, but no condition differences were found for mathematical achievement. Participants in the blended learning condition valued the flexibility of course structure and control over instructional pace but expressed that time management and decreased physical presence of the instructor were challenges. These findings suggest important elements to consider when designing blended learning courses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Some mathematicians’ perceived and envisioned instructional relationships in secondary teaching and teaching secondary teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When it comes to content courses for prospective secondary teachers, mathematics faculty’s intentions conflict with teachers’ experiences: while faculty aim to influence teachers’ future teaching, many teachers find these courses irrelevant to teaching. In this study, we investigate mathematics faculty’s goals for content courses for prospective secondary teachers and how these goals connect to their vision of secondary teaching. This study makes two contributions. First, drawing on data from an interview study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5) of faculty who have taught secondary teachers, we articulate these mathematicians’ rationales with respect to teaching secondary teachers, particularly in capstone courses. Second, we contribute a conceptual framework that supports inferences about connections between content course activities and instructors’ beliefs about secondary teaching. We conclude by suggesting that the dual triad that depicts our framework may support professional development and programmatic design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The use of a scriptwriting task as a window into how prospective teachers envision teacher moves for supporting student reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The development of mathematical reasoning skills has increasingly been of focus for the teaching and learning of mathematics. This research utilizes a teaching simulation using the methodology of scriptwriting, in which prospective teachers are asked to complete a script of a dialogue from a classroom simulation involving fraction multiplication and division with justification, assisting fictional students to work through their difficulties and helping them to justify their reasoning. Such tasks allow for the examination of the prospective teacher moves to support student reasoning through their imagined action and choice of words. Scripts from forty-one prospective primary teachers were examined for the study, and five clusters based on the type of teacher move for supporting student reasoning were found. Overall, the prospective teachers emphasized the elicitation and facilitation of students’ ideas. The cluster analysis, however, provided a nuanced examination of the cohort’s teacher moves. While cluster one saw the highest incident of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;eliciting&lt;/em&gt; teacher moves, albeit only in the low potential category, clusters two and three mostly used &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;facilitating&lt;/em&gt; teacher moves, but varied in their use of high and low potential moves. Cluster four concentrated moves on &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;facilitating, eliciting,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;responding to student reasoning&lt;/em&gt;. Cluster five employed teacher moves from all main categories, with some instances of high potential moves in all categories except &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;extending student reasoning&lt;/em&gt;, which can better support reasoning. The prospective mathematics teachers’ scripts and the five clusters that were found during analysis are discussed with implications for future teacher education and the support of building mathematical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Secondary mathematics preservice teachers’ perceptions of program (in)coherence</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teacher educators globally have argued that developing coherent programs can combat the fragmentation that often characterizes teacher education and better support teacher learning. Yet, there is little research on coherence in mathematics teacher education, especially from the perspectives of preservice teachers. To that end, in this article, we report how 13 secondary mathematics preservice teachers (PSTs) from one teacher education program perceived their program as coherent, specifically attending to the ideas and practices PSTs engaged with and the settings in which they engaged with those ideas/practices. Based on participatory diagramming interviews and network analysis, we found that PSTs experienced two main sources of incoherence. First, although PSTs had opportunities to learn about equity from multiple settings, they did not perceive that equity and other aspects of mathematics instruction together were coherently organized. Second, PSTs reported learning about two opposing instructional approaches—direct instruction and inquiry-based instruction. PSTs reported that opportunities to learn about inquiry-based instruction were primarily isolated to courses taught by the mathematics education program and were contradicted by learning and experiencing direct instruction in their special education courses, mathematics courses, and field and student teaching experiences. Findings highlight a need to attend to issues of equity, as well as connections among university coursework and between coursework and field. Based on our findings, we conclude with implications for how teacher education programs might respond to and engage with incoherence to support PST learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do mathematicians wish to teach teachers about the discipline of mathematics?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates what mathematicians, who teach academic mathematics courses to secondary school mathematics teachers, want to teach them about the discipline of mathematics. Data sources included interviews with five research mathematicians. The data analysis revealed that expanding teachers’ knowledge about the discipline of mathematics was one of the interviewees’ main objectives. The mathematicians referred to nine characteristics that can be grouped into three key aspects: (1) essence of mathematics, (2) doing mathematics, and (3) worth of mathematics. The characteristics of the discipline of mathematics generated in our study are in line with ideas and practices widely advocated in the last decades for the teaching and learning of mathematics, and with contemporary philosophical approaches regarding mathematics. The potential of the characteristics to serve as a conceptual framework in studies that focus on teacher knowledge about the discipline of mathematics is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I find this task interesting, so do you? Preservice teachers’ judgments of students’ enjoyment, boredom, and situational interest regarding tasks with and without a connection to reality</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students’ emotions (e.g., enjoyment, boredom) while doing math and their situational interest in mathematics are important for their learning of mathematics, but examinations of teachers’ judgments of students’ emotions and interest while solving tasks are rare. Moreover, we do not know much about the predictors of teachers’ judgments of students’ emotions and interest. In this study, we addressed preservice teachers’ judgments of students’ task-specific enjoyment, boredom, and situational interest and analyzed whether such judgments are related to preservice teachers’ own enjoyment, boredom, and interest. Furthermore, we aimed to analyze whether preservice teachers’ judgments differ between the two types of tasks under investigation (tasks with and without a connection to reality). To achieve these aims, 182 preservice teachers were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions. In one condition, preservice teachers&#39; judgments of task-specific emotions and situational interest for fictitious 9th-grade students were measured, and in the second condition, preservice teachers&#39; own task-specific emotions and situational interest were measured. The results show that preservice teachers&#39; judgments of students’ task-specific emotions and situational interest differ for tasks with and without a connection to reality. Further, our findings indicate that preservice teachers’ judgments of students’ task-specific emotions and interest differ from preservice teachers&#39; own task-specific emotions and interest. Implications for theoretical models of teachers’ judgments and consequences for teacher education are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
