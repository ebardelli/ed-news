        <title>Students’ approaches when capturing change in contextual graphs: a study combining eye tracking and stimulated recall interviews</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;One central element in understanding the concept of function and developing functional thinking is the aspect of covariation. Covariation describes how the change in one quantity affects the other one. A lack of students’ understanding of covariation leads to errors and misconceptions. This is particularly evident in students’ interpretations of graphs, where covariation is needed to understand the data. Up to now, it is not sufficiently known how students capture covariation in contextual graphs representing data from real-world phenomena. Our study aims to identify secondary school students’ approaches when capturing change in contextual graphs and students’ use of approaches. In our study, 19 ninth graders were asked to describe the change of two graphs from different situational contexts. To get detailed insights into their process of capturing the change, we triangulated eye-tracking data with verbal protocols and stimulated recall interviews. We identified nine approaches that students used to capture change in contextual graphs, which can be grouped into four main types (pairs of values, section by section, holistically, and total change). Moreover, based on students’ use of approaches in the two tasks, we identified task characteristics that seem to be related to the approach used, such as the situational context and the type of graph. The findings thus mark a first step towards improving the teaching and learning of task-specific graph interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Superintendent Turnover and Student Achievement: A Two-State Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Increased public scrutiny has thrust school superintendents into the spotlight, possibly exacerbating their turnover. To better understand how superintendent turnover is associated with student achievement, we collected data on school superintendent turnover in Florida and Texas spanning 2009–10 to 2017–18 school years. We conducted an event study difference-in-differences analysis to examine the dynamic relationship between superintendent turnover and student achievement. Student achievement decreases in the years after a superintendent turns over, though this relationship is small in magnitude (−0.015 standard deviation units). Superintendent turnover is most detrimental in urban school districts, districts enrolling more students, and districts with more concentrated student poverty, though these negative relationships can be partially explained by instability in the district that led to the superintendent’s departure.

        <title>Equal Inputs, Unequal Outputs: How Capacity Limits Policy Implementation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As education researchers continue to investigate policies at scale and across diverse contexts, scholars must develop a better understanding of mechanisms shaping policy effects. In this study, we use the case of a federal initiative allowing high school students to use the Pell Grant for dual enrollment to investigate how institutions’ capacities shaped policy efficacy. We find that colleges’ capacities for policy implementation depended on their pre-existing resources (“foundational capacity”), the resources to execute the policy given policy-induced constraints (“execution capacity”), and the resources to provide the target population with access to the policy (“provision capacity”). We contend that institutions that may benefit the most from equitable policies also have the least capacity to implement them.

        <title>Voters, Parents, and Curricular Control: Preferences for Instruction Related to Racism and Critical Race Theory</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In recent years, debates surrounding instruction related to Critical Race Theory (CRT) have proliferated across the United States, flamed by political actors and media pundits who ushered a heretofore largely academic concentration into the public sphere. In this study, we examine opinions of voters and parents of school-aged children regarding racism-related instruction in Missouri, a locus of anti-CRT legislative debate. We find that though voters and parents are less likely to support allowing CRT-related instruction in schools, both groups support the permissibility of institutional and systemic racism-focused instruction, despite overlap between the two curricular emphases. Conversely, voter preferences are predicted much more strongly by political ideology than are parent preferences. Together, these findings question the role of anti-CRT legislative aims.

        <title>Collective Sensemaking During State-Mandated Dev-Ed Reforms: Variation in Policy Signals and Collective Deliberations Across Actors’ Role Responsibilities</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;States and colleges nationwide are adopting corequisite reforms, where students concurrently enroll in developmental and college-level coursework. Leveraging the concept of collective sensemaking and interviews with 54 actors at 16 community colleges implementing a statewide corequisite mandate, we examine the policy signals actors received, how personnel in different roles interacted to create an implementation plan, and how institutional supports and constraints shaped collective responses to policy. We find that actors within the same institutions—and even the same position—received different types of policy signals, often shaped by gatekeeping behavior among administrators over which actors should inhabit core implementation roles. Actors with peripheral roles were detached from the early deliberation of policy signals, minimizing their influence over implementation.

        <title>Exploring the Potential of Self-Assessment for Teachers’ Development of ICT Competencies and Beliefs</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We evaluate the effects of an online self-assessment tool on teachers’ competencies and beliefs about information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education. The causal impact of the tool is evaluated through a randomized encouragement design involving 7,391 lower secondary teachers across 11 European countries. Short-run impact estimates show that the use of the tool led teachers to critically revise their technology-enhanced teaching competencies (−0.14 standard deviations [SD]) and their beliefs about the use of ICT in education (−0.35 SD), while no impact on teachers’ ICT training is found. The effects are concentrated among teachers in the top-end tail of the distribution of pre-treatment outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence that the feedback score provided by the tool triggered such results by providing a negative information shock.

        <title>The evaluation of an instructional model for developing the reasoning capabilities of students with mathematical learning difficulties in the context of fraction comparisons</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study presents an instructional model that integrates research-based practices from the fields of mathematics education and special education to support the development of students’ reasoning and examines how the reasoning of the participants, 30 students with mathematical learning difficulties (ages 10 to 12 years), evolves over time. Nineteen of the students were from urban public schools and 11 were from a private school for students with learning differences in the Southwest USA; eight of the students had a special education diagnosis, and the other 22 students had no diagnosis. The model, which emphasises shared student thinking in a small-group setting and instructional decisions in response to that thinking, was implemented in the context of fraction comparisons. Descriptive and inferential analyses of correctness and completeness of student reasoning on a pre- and post-test measure as well as formative measures incorporated throughout instruction indicated significant findings with respect to growth in student reasoning. The study has implications for future research when considering how to support the development of mathematical reasoning within the population of students who struggle in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evaluating the Effect on Infants and Parents Attending the Parent–Child Psychological Support Programme®, a Community-Based Program to Promote Attachment Security</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The foremost index of caregiving quality is child attachment, as supported by attachment theory. Research supports the relevance of early parenting interventions in improving child outcomes in attachment quality to promote public health because of their long-term effects on mental health and functioning. This study aimed at evaluating the impact on both parenting and child outcomes of the Parent–Child Psychological Support Programme® (PCPS), a community-based program individually tailored to parents and their infants during periodic center-based visits to promote attachment security. The evaluation involved two cohorts from “vulnerable populations” and used the resources embedded in the program design without interfering with the normal functioning of the service. From an evaluative research approach, the effects on mothers and children were assessed using a quantitative approach. Pre- and post-test measures (parenting questionnaires) and child attachment quality assessments through the Strange Situation Procedure were examined. The equivalence of the cohorts was verified and used as a baseline for parenting outcomes. PCPS participants demonstrated increased parental competence and self-efficacy, as well as reduced levels of parenting stress. Analysis of the two cohorts showed a significant difference in the number of visits and proxies for intervention, which were associated with the expected pre–post changes in parenting dimensions. The proportion of securely attached children was significantly higher in the “medium-high intervention” group than in the “no/low intervention” group (72.7% vs 54.5%). Furthermore, compared with international baselines, this proportion showed no differences in the “no-/low-intervention” group but demonstrated expected significant differences in the “medium-high intervention” group.

        <title>The New Politics of Education and the Pursuit of a Diverse Democracy</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/11&quot;&gt;Volume 11, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2025. &lt;br/&gt;The increasingly partisan politics of education make it vital to conceptualize why and to empirically assess how current partisan pressures threaten public schools’ efforts to educate toward a diverse democracy. We examine these dynamics, drawing on a survey of a large and diverse sample of high school principals, weighted to reflect national demographics, conducted in summer 2022. We find that high schools in purple contexts are particularly likely to experience parent and community pushback related to education toward a diverse democracy and that schools in purple and red communities are less likely to provide support for this priority. By mapping this terrain, the study informs our understanding of the new partisan politics of education, priorities for future research, and, ultimately, directions for strategic action on the part of key stakeholders.

        <title>Mathematical creativity in modelling: further development of the construct, its measurement, and its empirical implementation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although considerable research has been conducted on mathematical modelling and mathematical creativity separately, relatively few studies have explored their intersection. This study builds on the framework established by Lu and Kaiser to conceptualise creativity in mathematical modelling. In the paper an elaborated model of creativity that is unique to mathematical modelling is presented and appropriate assessment methods are developed. Creativity is redefined in this context and a new method for measuring it is proposed. The method extends the previously identified elements of creativity for mathematical modelling and includes an empirical test to assess creativity in mathematical modelling. In the study 141 pre-service mathematics teachers from two types of teacher education institutes in China were assessed on their creativity performance in mathematical modelling using the newly developed scoring system. Statistical analysis revealed significant findings: preservice mathematics teachers showed different levels of creativity in different modelling tasks, and significant differences in creativity were observed between the groups from two different institutes. These findings enrich the understanding of how creativity manifests itself in mathematical modelling. They also highlight the importance of developing pedagogical strategies to foster and assess creative competencies in future mathematics teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The relationships between student content-specific grouping and teachers-students’ interactions during online collaborative mathematical task solving</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We examined the relationships between student content-specific grouping and the attributes of teachers-students’ interactions during online collaborative mathematical task solving using a learning analytics tool for automatic formative assessment. Such technology offloads some teachers’ responsibilities regarding mathematical aspects of learning, and we therefore ask, what are the characteristics of teachers’ interactions with students in this context? How do these characteristics relate to content-specific grouping? We examined teachers’ interactions with 29 pairs of 10th-grade students in distance group mathematics learning in a technological environment on the subject of the quadratic function. Students were teamed according to their work on a preliminary task in one of the following ways: encompassing, mutual, or similar. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of teachers’ interactions with students and interviews were conducted. We identified four categories of teacher actions that characterize dialog facilitation: task comprehension, technology use, mathematics content, and interpersonal interactions. The findings showed that teachers initiated more inferences than students in the interpersonal and task comprehension categories, while there was no significant difference between the initiators of the other categories. Furthermore, teachers and students initiated interpersonal interactions significantly more when groups were grouped with unbalanced relationships (encompassing, commonly known as heterogeneous grouping). These findings shed light on the potential to foster nuanced abilities of mathematics teachers to facilitate group work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Young students’ engagement with data to create decision trees</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Statistics and machine learning are critical because they play an essential role in our everyday lives and the careers we may pursue in the future. It may be beneficial to introduce machine learning, such as decision trees (DTs), at an early stage of education. The data-based construction of DTs is an example of a machine learning process, which can be addressed in mathematics or statistics teaching because of relatively low prior knowledge requirements. This paper focuses on investigating how sixth-grade students create and evaluate data-based DTs. The basis is a teaching unit that aims to lay the foundation for machine learning and enhance students’ understanding of the process. We investigate students’ processes in detail while they build DTs with data cards about food items to predict whether a new item is recommendable. After the teaching unit, an interview study examines students’ strategies for creating decision trees. The findings contribute to understanding students’ learning processes and the challenges when working with decision trees.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How novice mathematics teacher-educators notice the mathematical and pedagogical thinking of preservice mathematic teachers: An emerging model</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper aims to characterize critical events noticed by novice mathematics teacher-educators (NMTEs) while they facilitate teacher education sessions. Twenty-four NMTEs enrolled in a university course on teaching teachers were asked to facilitate a series of three sessions with preservice teachers, identify critical events from those sessions and analyze these events. Analysis of the 72 critical events reported by the NMTEs yielded a model that can be used to characterize critical events in teacher education sessions (CETEs) and to identify variations within these events. The model comprises three axes: the event participants, the event focus and the dimensions in learning and teaching mathematics (i.e., cognitive, affective and social). The paper discusses the theoretical and empirical construction of the model and demonstrates its potential contribution using examples from our research.&lt;/p&gt;

Research is needed to support pre-service mathematics teachers’ experiences with exploring such image-based data. With this task-based interview study, the goal was to shed light on (1) the pre-service mathematics teachers’ data-ing actions during identifying and generating variables in relation to data familiarization, question posing, and data organization components and (2) how pre-service mathematics teachers identified and generated variables in the process of data-ing. Data from video recordings, transcripts of the interview sessions for each pair, and their work with photos on the shared online document, that is, groupings and questions posed, were analyzed using a progressive focusing approach. The results showed that the data-ing actions during identifying and generating variables with data familiarization, question posing, and data organization included observing, interpreting, conjecturing, inferring, comparing, grouping, ordering, questioning/question posing, relating variables, categorizing variables, and measuring variables. The pairs used various combinations of multiple actions while data-ing. There were two types of variable identification: (1) observational variables based on visual judgment or metadata and (2) inferential variables based on personal interpretation. The latter type presented a tension between the variable defined and how to measure it objectively, as well as challenges in writing clearly defined variables when posing questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Assessing children’s capacity for procedural flexibility with mental addition</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Children’s number-based procedures for mental computation have been widely studied but few studies have focused on children’s flexibility with mental computation procedures. In this study, we investigated children’s capacity for procedural flexibility with mental addition by developing and testing a novel assessment that required them to recognize an efficient strategy used by another (fictitious) child. Testing was conducted in eight metropolitan primary schools in Australia and involved administering the assessment to children in Years 3 and 4 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 853). The final version of the assessment comprised 23 items and produced data that were closely aligned to the Rasch model, reflected a unidimensional construct and showed good precision and excellent reliability. Findings from item analyses confirmed predictions about the problem features that evoke thinking about particular strategies and the comparative difficulty of strategy types. These findings contribute insights into how procedural flexibility may be operationalised, making it possible to compare instructional approaches for promoting procedural flexibility on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
