        <title>Walking the Talk: Engendering a “Community of Teachers” in an Educator Preparation Program in the Southern United States</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, the Education Studies Department (ESD) at Berea College shares lessons learned while becoming an inclusive, justice-focused, and democratic Education Preparation Program (EPP) together with its “Community of Teachers” (CoT). ESD values diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI+B) and democratic relationships. These values influence how we do our work. We begin by sharing how the theoretical framework of Community of Practice (CoP) frames our case study. After explaining how a CoP applies to ESD’s approach to educator preparation, we give an overview of Berea College. We share some of its history and its eight Great Commitments. We detail how ESD is a unique EPP compared with other more traditional EPPs. Next, we chronicle the story of how ESD “walks its talk” and invests in the teacher profession. We detail the participants of the case study, outline our methodology of the case study, and share the data we analyzed for this article. Data were analyzed and three emergent themes were discovered about the praxis of ESD: (a) community-engaged and justice-focused teacher preparation, (b) community building within teacher preparation programs, and (c) diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. The article concludes by sharing implications for EPPs and a conclusion.

        <title>Does Knowing the Word Matter for Preschool DLLS? Individualized Vocabulary Words on Phonological Awareness Performance</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Early literacy assessment has become commonplace in the preschool years, with phonological awareness constituting one component of emergent literacy targeted by such practices. This within-subjects experimental study examines the role of word familiarity on 93 dual language preschoolers’ performance on phoneme-level awareness tasks in three-phoneme words. A researcher-designed digital tool created individualized test items (foils and target responses) for each child. Half of the items presented target responses that contained familiar words, and half contained unfamiliar words. Results suggest unknown/unfamiliar target words yield lower phonological awareness performance scores.

        <title>Undergraduate Grading Practices of International and Domestic Faculty: Evidence From Three Large U.S. Public Universities</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Given the prominence of international instructors in higher education, understanding their grading practices is essential for informing college grading debates. This first large-scale assessment of undergraduate grading practices highlights how different demographic, classroom and departmental factors shape international instructors’ grading behaviors. Using a unique dataset of over 2,000 randomly selected instructors from three public universities, we examine (a) whether undergraduate-level grading practices differ between domestic and international instructors, (b) what factors contribute to the differences, and (c) whether the differences vary across key subgroups. We find that international instructors grade lower than domestic instructors—about 35% of a standard deviation lower on average. Part of this gap is explained by the concentration of international instructors in particular departments. International instructor grading practices differ across regions of origin, prior U.S. higher education experience, gender, and race. Our results provide insights into U.S. college grading debates and supporting the international instructor workforce.

        <title>The State of Elementary School Recess in Georgia: Policy, the Pandemic, and Patterns of Play</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While we continue to see a growing push for the restoration and codification of recess in elementary schools, policy does not necessarily equal practice. Georgia recently passed legislation requiring at least 20 minutes of recess per day for students in PK-5. The purpose of this research study was to survey elementary school educators to reveal the temporal (i.e., duration, frequency, and cancellation practices) and descriptive (i.e., type, equipment, place) characteristics of recess in Georgia’s public elementary schools. The results of this study, which can be summed up statistically and descriptively as less recess overall, and less free play specifically, as well as reduced access to safe play spaces since the onset of the pandemic, yield important policy implications for Georgia’s school children. These implications relate to persistent disparities in immediate and long-term positive outcomes for children across multiple domains including academic, social-emotional, and behavioral.

        <title>Race Placed: Special Education Identification and Placement of Black Students</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study investigates the overrepresentation of Black students in special education by looking at the association of race and related variables with referral, identification, and placement. Analyses were performed on a statewide sample of students and teachers to investigate relationships between student, teacher and school demographics, and special education identification and placement. The results find (1) black students assigned to black teachers are less likely to be identified for special services, (2) black students are less likely to be in inclusive placements with increases in white student enrollment, and (3) black students are more likely to be identified for special services and placed in more restrictive settings.

        <title>Traits of generalization of problem solution methods exhibited by potential mathematically gifted students when solving problems in a selection process</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Identifying mathematically gifted students is an important objective in mathematics education. To describe skills typical of these students, researchers pose problems in several mathematical domains whose solutions require using different mathematical capacities, such as visualization, generalization, proof, creativity, etc. This paper presents an analysis of the solutions to two problems by 75 students (aged 11–14), as part of the selection test for a workshop to stimulate mathematical talent. These problems require the use of the capacity for mathematical generalization of solution methods. We define a set of descriptors of such capacity, use them to analyze students’ solutions, and evaluate how well students with high capacity for generalization can be distinguished from average students. The results indicate that the two problems are suitable for identifying potential mathematically gifted students and several descriptors have high discriminatory power to identify students with high or low capacity for generalization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using a Deep Learning-Based Visual Computational Model to Identify Cognitive Strategies in Matrix Reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.

        <title>Co-designing teaching with digital technologies: a case study on mixed pre-service and in-service mathematics teacher design teams</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The development of professional digital competencies is an important condition for a meaningful integration of digital technologies in mathematics education. A widely used and empirically studied approach for the professional development of in-service teachers are teacher design teams, in which lessons are collaboratively planned, implemented and reflected. However, this approach has not yet been considered for the collaboration of pre-service and in-service teachers. Therefore, this article examines in a holistic case study mixed teacher design teams composed of pre-service and in-service teachers. A total of 23 interviews were conducted with pre-service and in-service teachers and analyzed by inductive development of categories using the method of qualitative content analysis. The case study shows among other things, that the different prerequisites of the participants can lead to a relatively clear division of roles within the collaboration, which turns out to be suitable for the professionalization of both pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A transdisciplinary study of a novice mathematics teacher’s instructional decision-making</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we examine the real-time decision-making processes of a teacher in a UK post-16 mathematics classroom focusing on the integration of student-centred teaching methods. The contribution of this study is a transdisciplinary theoretical discussion which links teachers’ actual classroom practices (often traditional and teacher centred) with their professed student-centred perspectives. Utilising Abductive Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, this research incorporates cognitive, social psychological, sociocultural theory and perspectives on affect in the context of in-the-moment decisions. Through co-construction, we identify distinct but overlapping agentic and ecological dimensions of decisions. Recognising that teachers’ spontaneous decisions in the classroom are shaped by both their agency and the social and physical ecology of the classroom, this study provides a structured approach to understanding how diverse disciplinary concepts are related, and paints a dynamic picture of the process of teacher decision-making. This is crucial for identifying both limitations and possibilities in teacher education and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pre-service mathematics teachers’ personal meanings proclaiming about the characteristics of realistic mathematics problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to elicit middle school pre-service mathematics teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems. The study presents a portion of a larger design-based study involving teacher training sessions encompassing small-group discussions, writing realistic mathematics problems, and whole-group discussions. The audio records of the pre-service teachers’ discussions and their written artifacts were analyzed in three coding cycles. The findings indicated that the pre-service teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems comprised both in-school situations that students themselves could experience and real-life situations that mostly required occupational decisions such as optimization in engineering. Besides, pre-service teachers considered that realistic situations often involve multiple information and could be solved by multiple solution methods that might lead to multiple acceptable answers. This study highlighted the informative role of articulating pre-service mathematics teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems in designing teacher education courses and further discussed such implications for mathematics teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leading Systemwide Improvement in Elementary Science Education: Managing Dilemmas of Education System Building</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Reforming instruction is challenging. In this comparative case study of 12 school districts, we investigated the dilemmas that emerged for system leaders as they engaged in system building for elementary science and the approaches leaders took in managing them. We found that system leaders’ efforts to manage their environments contributed to the preferential treatment of literacy and mathematics relative to science. Leaders managed this dilemma using three strategies: (a) integration of science with other subjects, (b) specialization of teachers, and (c) adopting curriculum materials. This study contributes to literature on dilemma management by showing that dilemmas in education system building are school-subject sensitive, emerge in relation to system building for other subjects, and are embedded in school and education systems’ structural/organizational arrangements.

        <title>“I’ll just try to mimic that”: an exploration of students’ analogical structure creation in abstract algebra</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Despite the prominence of analogies in mathematics, little attention has been given to exploring students’ processes of analogical reasoning, and even less research exists on revealing how students might be empowered to independently and productively reason by analogy to establish new (to them) mathematics. I argue that the lack of a cohesive framework for interpreting students’ approaches to analogical reasoning in mathematics contributes to this issue. To address this, I introduce the Analogical Reasoning in Mathematics (ARM) framework. Constructed from an analysis of interviews with four abstract algebra students, ARM identifies several analogical activities that serve to analyze students’ analogical reasoning with a finer grain size than was previously possible with existing frameworks. Using this framework, I present an analysis of the students’ constructions of a ring-theoretic analogy to subgroup, thus revealing that even constructing simple analogies can elicit diverse pathways of analogical reasoning across students. Implications for further research related to analogies and analogical reasoning in mathematics education are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Decomposing Impact on Longitudinal Outcome of Time-Varying Covariate into Baseline Effect and Temporal Effect</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Longitudinal processes are often associated with each other over time; therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental processes and understand their joint development. The traditional latent growth curve model (LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the TVC effect on a longitudinal outcome while modeling the outcome’s change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC into initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized as (a) interval-specific slopes, (b) interval-specific changes, or (c) changes from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses, assuming a linear–linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear functions.

        <title>Example-Generation Tasks for Computer-Aided Assessment in University Mathematics Education: Insights From A Study Conducted in Two Educational Contexts</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In recent decades, there has been rapid development in digital technologies for automated assessment. Through enhanced possibilities in terms of algorithms, grading codes, adaptivity, and feedback, they are suitable for formative assessment. There is a need to develop computer-aided assessment (CAA) tasks that target higher-order mathematical skills to ensure a balanced assessment approach beyond basic procedural skills. To address this issue, research suggests the approach of asking students to generate examples. This study focuses on an example-generation task on polynomial function understanding, proposed to 205 first-year engineering students in Sweden and 111 first-year biotechnology students in Italy. Students were encouraged to collaborate in small groups, but individual elements within the tasks required each group member to provide individual answers. Students&#39; responses kept in the CAA system were qualitatively analyzed to understand the effectiveness of the task in extending the students’ example space in diverse educational contexts. The findings indicate a difference in students’ example spaces when performing the task between the two educational contexts. The results suggest key strengths and possible improvements to the task design.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Active Learning in Proof-Based Mathematics Courses: Pedagogical Approaches and Observations</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Writing-intensive and proof-based mathematics courses have a variety of unique course outcomes and challenges. As such, active learning in these courses may differ from what we traditionally expect to see in an “active” first-year calculus course: an interactive in-class activity can be replaced with an out-of-class reading and homework problem in a proof-based course. We argue that the latter is no less “active” and claim that reading and writing mathematics form the foundation of how students learn by doing in writing-intensive mathematics courses. In this commentary, we discuss our pedagogical approaches to supporting students’ learning in introductory mathematical writing courses and how we promote active engagement. We outline potential benefits and challenges of these teaching methods and assessment strategies and conclude with some questions for reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning to Serve from Service Courses</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Educators are in a time of change, as the emergence, availability, and growth of AI technology challenge long-standing assumptions about the purpose and pedagogies in higher education. In this commentary, I argue that service course designers and instructors have been facing similar dilemmas for over 30 years. I propose that educators can learn from the practices of service course coordinators, and that a service mindset — where we willingly place ourselves in the role of a servant to our students, colleagues, and other stakeholders — is one that we need if we are going to do big things in the face of the challenges ahead. I provide an illustration of the considerations that I made to serve multiple stakeholders as I designed one aspect of a very large, multisection calculus course, and how a service mindset helped to simplify my work.&lt;/p&gt;
