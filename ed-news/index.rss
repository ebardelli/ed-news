        <title>The “Good” Schools: Academic Performance Data, School Choice, and Segregation</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;We examine the effects of disseminating school-level academic performance data—achievement status, achievement growth, or both—on parents’ school choices and their implications for racial, ethnic, and economic segregation. Many researchers consider growth to be a superior (if still imperfect) measure of school effectiveness relative to status. Moreover, compared to status, growth has weaker relationships with schools’ demographic compositions. We conduct an online survey experiment featuring a nationally representative sample of parents and caretakers of children ages 0–12. Participants choose between three randomly sampled elementary schools drawn from the same school district. The provision of status information guides participants toward schools with higher achievement status and fewer Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. The provision of growth information and the provision of both types of academic performance data guide participants toward higher growth schools. However, only growth information—alone, and not in concert with status information—tends to elicit choices with desegregating consequences.

        <title>Civic Online Reasoning Across the Curriculum: Developing and Testing the Efficacy of Digital Literacy Lessons</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Given the current threat posed by toxic digital content, preparing students to evaluate online sources cannot be relegated to a single subject area—this instruction should happen across the curriculum. This article focuses on materials designed to teach students to evaluate online information across subject areas. ninth-grade biology and world geography teachers taught a series of curriculum-embedded lessons based on the following design principles: (a) Focus on a core question and strategy; (b) engage students in evaluating real online content; (c) feature cognitive apprenticeship and formative assessment; and (d) support teacher learning. We examine whether these lessons helped students become more skilled evaluators of online content. Pretest/posttest data (N =574) showed statistically significant growth in students’ ability to evaluate the credibility of online content. We analyze the role played by the curriculum design principles in this interdisciplinary intervention and explore implications for future initiatives.

        <title>Extending co-operative inquiry beyond the human: Ontopoetic inquiry with rivers</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Co-operative inquiry was conceived as an authentic science of humans as self-determining persons. But what if we extend our definition of persons to include beings in the more-than-human world – and indeed the cosmos itself – as sentient and responsive? This paper gives some account of a series of co-operative inquiries with human and river persons worldwide, drawing on living cosmos panpsychism to address questions of the kind, What would it be like to live in a world of sentient beings rather than inert objects? The paper includes some narratives of encounters with animals who appear at our river encounters, and reflects on the veracity claims we are making.

        <title>Do Trade and Financial Cooperation Improve Environmentally Sustainable Development: A Distinction Between de facto and de jure Globalization</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The adoption of growth strategies based on foreign trade, especially in the previous century when liberal policies began to dominate, is one of the main reasons for the increase in output and indirectly for environmental concerns. On the other hand, there are complex claims about the environmental effects of liberal policies and thus of globalization. This study intends to analyze the effects of global collaborations involving 11 transition economies that have completed the transition process on the environmentally sustainable development of these nations. In this direction, the effects of financial and commercial globalization indices on carbon emissions are investigated. The distinctions of globalization are used to distinguish the consequences of the two types of globalization. In doing so, the de facto and de jure indicator distinctions of globalization are used to differentiate the consequences of two types of globalization. In addition, the effects of real GDP, energy efficiency, and use of renewable energy on environmental pollution are dissected. For the main purpose of the study, the CS-ARDL estimation technique that allows cross-sectional dependency among observed countries is used to separate the short and long-run influences of explanatory variables. In addition, CCE-MG estimator is used for robustness check. According to the empirical findings, the economic growth and increasing energy intensity increases carbon emissions, but the increase in renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality. Furthermore, trade globalization does not have a significant impact on the environment in the context of globalization. On the other hand, the increase in de facto and de jure financial globalization indices results in an increase in carbon emissions, but de jure financial globalization causes more environmental damage. The harmful impact of de jure financial globalization on environmental quality suggests that the decreasing investment restrictions and international investment agreements of transition countries have been implemented in a manner that facilitates the relocation of investments from pollution-intensive industries to these countries.

        <title>Tangible connections within the mathematical horizon: Exploring the Dihedral Calculator</title>

            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report on a group theory activity in which learners explored dihedral symmetries through a tangible geometric model. This approach has historical roots in the work of Felix Klein’s Erlangen Program and his &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint&lt;/em&gt;. We situate our study with respect to this history as well as current educational research in spatial visual reasoning, abstract algebra, and teacher knowledge. Our findings highlight opportunities that tangible geometric models can provide for fostering structural and interconnected understanding characteristic of teachers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;knowledge at the mathematical horizon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyond Cultural Mismatch Theories: The Role of Antiblackness in School Discipline and Social Control Practices</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Black students face hyper-disciplining and high levels of social control when they enter American schools. The cultural mismatch hypothesis attempts to explain this hyper-disciplining by arguing that the mostly White teaching force misinterprets the attitudes and behaviors of Black students, which leads to their hyper-disciplining. Utilizing a longitudinal, deeply iterative, participatory, and critical ethnographic research process, however, this article shows that traditional scholarship around the cultural mismatch hypothesis is insufficient. The analysis indicates that teachers’ misinterpretation of mismatched capital (the traditional cultural mismatch hypothesis) is actually a racialized interpretation of both matched and mismatched capital coming from Black students, and such racialized interpretations are guided by the logic of antiblackness endemic to American institutions. Hence, this research argues for the integration of antiblackness as a theoretical tool to expand upon cultural mismatch explanations and for the creation of educational spaces where Black students are recognized, valued, and treated with dignity and humanization.

        <title>Digital Redlining: The Relevance of 20th Century Housing Policy to 21st Century Broadband Access and Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Broadband is not equally accessible among students despite its increasing importance to education. We investigate the relationship between broadband and housing policy by joining two measures of broadband access with Depression-era redlining maps that classified neighborhoods based in part on racist and classist beliefs. We find that despite internet service provider self-reports of similar technological availability, broadband access generally decreases in tandem with historic neighborhood classification, with further heterogeneity by race/ethnicity and income. Our findings demonstrate how past federally-developed housing policies connect to the digital divide and should be considered in educational policies that require broadband for success.

        <title>The relationship between prospective teachers’ mathematics knowledge for teaching and their ability to notice student thinking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we investigate the links between prospective elementary teachers’ (PTs’) ability to notice student mathematical thinking, their mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) and their ability to decompose learning goals into component conceptual parts (Morris et al., &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r34&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/span&gt;). Previously, researchers have proposed theoretical connections between MKT and teachers’ professional noticing, but empirical support for these relationships has been limited. Results of this mixed-methods study indicate that PTs who scored higher on an MKT assessment outperformed their peers in terms of attending to student thinking but had similar performance in terms of interpreting that thinking. However, PTs who were able to conceptually unpack a learning goal into subconstructs performed higher-quality interpretations of student thinking. We hypothesize that the skill of decomposing learning goals may allow PTs to apply their mathematics knowledge to successfully interpret student work. These results have implications for understanding how noticing and MKT may develop in relation with each other.

        <title>Context Variation in U.S. High Schoolers’ Mathematics Orientations</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Educators increasingly recognize the importance of students’ learning orientations, but relatively little is known about how these mindsets vary across and potentially shape educational settings. We use nationally representative data to document contextual variation in mathematics orientations in U.S. high schools. We find systematic variation in orientations between differentiated course levels within school, suggesting orientations are more a feature of proximate instructional contexts than general school climate. Between-course variation in orientations is comparable to analogous sorting on demographic characteristics and not primarily explained by prior achievement. Measures of individual learning orientations at scale hold promise for understanding collective educational contexts.

        <title>“There’s a Lot of Stumbling Forward”: The Impact of Whiteness on Teacher Educators’ Reconceptualization of Culturally Based English Education Curriculum</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Practices incorporating students’ cultures and communities are foundational to effective teaching. However, teacher candidates often do not effectively incorporate culturally based practices into their instruction. This article describes the perceptions of English education instructors as they reconceptualized their curriculum to cultivate culturally based practices. Findings show three major factors impacted the instructors’ reconceptualization of curriculum: (a) the instructors’ cultural roots; (b) the pervasiveness of whiteness—systems and processes that preference white identities, assumptions, and privileges that accompany the white experience; and (c) deep-seated tensions between culturally based practices and the practices of the university operating within the institution of English education. The authors assert that no individual who has matriculated through white-centric educational institutions and broader societal structures can be excluded from the call to unlearn whiteness. They urge teacher educators to dismantle oppressive, white-centric practices by reflecting on the interplay of biases and socio-political beliefs that they and their teacher candidates bring into educational spaces.

        <title>Definitional ambiguity in mathematics: three cases</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Definitions are an integral aspect of mathematics. In particular, they form the backbone of deductive reasoning and facilitate precision in mathematical communication. However, when multiple non-equivalent definitions for the same term exist, their ability to serve these purposes can be called into question. While ambiguity can be productive, the lack of an agreed upon definition can make the truth value of certain mathematical statements unclear. In this study, we presented pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers with three mathematical claims in which definitional ambiguity was a consideration; then, we asked them to determine the correctness of each claim, justify their positions, and anticipate what reasoning might lead to a possible counterargument. Based on their responses, we identified several factors that influenced the participants’ approaches in each situation as well as cross-cutting themes that describe their considerations. Finally, we consider the pedagogical implications of employing such a task in teacher preparation programs and in-service teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Collective Teacher Efficacy and Its Enabling Conditions: A Proposed Framework for Influencing Collective Efficacy in Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This quantitative study aims to explore the validity of Donohoo et al.’s (2020) Enabling Conditions for Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale (EC-CTES) for fostering collective efficacy in schools and evaluate its relationship to measures of collective teacher efficacy. The instruments used for this study include the EC-CTES, the Collective Efficacy Scale (CES-SF), and the Collective Teacher Beliefs Scale (CTBS). The data were evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis, correlation matrices, and multiple regression models. The findings from this study demonstrate that the EC-CTES is a valid tool. The EC-CTES subscales are positively associated with measures of collective teacher efficacy. We recommend adjustments for the EC-CTES subscales for greater congruence with collective efficacy theory and practical application. Due to the theoretical density of collective teacher efficacy, a modified conceptual framework is proposed to make the enabling conditions theory more accessible to practitioners.

        <title>Mathematics education research on language and on communication including some distinctions: Where are we now?</title>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this article, we present a narrative review of mathematics education research on language and on communication over 2019–2022, but also look ahead by addressing challenges posed by the lack of distinction between language and communication. The persistence and significance of the problem of the distinction between language and communication are thus outlined in a historical moment of celebration of growth of research in the domain. Informed by the analysis of a selection of research journal articles and by our trajectories, we discuss influential topics in the recent discourse: multilingual mathematics classrooms; mathematics teacher education on language in mathematics teaching; multimodal mathematical communication; interaction and mathematics learning; mathematical language and discourse. We connect this with new emerging or old revisited concepts: instructional designing, gesturing, argumenting and languaging. We finish by further reflecting on multimodal mathematical communication and gesturing, and on the potential of expanding the notion of mathematics register towards a notion of mathematics communication register.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Collaborative Construction, Through Whole-Class Presentation, to a Posteriori Reflection: Proof Progression in a Topology Classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Coming from a social perspective, we introduce a classroom organizational frame, where students’ proofs progress from collaborative construction in small groups, through whole-class presentation at the board by one of the constructors, to a posteriori reflection. This design is informed by a view on proofs as successive social processes in the mathematics community. To illustrate opportunities for mathematics learning of proof progressions, we present a commognitive analysis of a single proof from a small course in topology. The analysis illuminates the processes through which students’ proof was restructured, developed previously unarticulated elements, and became more formal and elaborate. Within this progression, the provers developed their mathematical discourses and the course teacher seized valuable teachable moments. The findings are discussed in relation to key themes within the social perspective on proof.&lt;/p&gt;

            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, whole-school reforms will continue to be a prominent strategy for improving student outcomes in low-performing schools. As reform models have proliferated, so has research evaluating the impact in reform schools. However, previous evaluations have rarely examined unintended spillover effects in nonreform schools. With data from Tennessee, this study uses difference-in-differences models to estimate spillover effects from teachers who transfer when their school begins implementing turnaround reforms. Results show that teachers who transfer tend to be less effective than teachers who stay, and they tend to move into nearby schools that are themselves low-performing. However, after transferring, these teachers produce modest positive spillover effects on student test scores in nonreform schools, which is likely explained by improvements in their effectiveness. Moreover, I find that working with more effective peers is a likely mechanism to explain improved teacher effectiveness after they transfer. Overall, this study draws attention to the need for future educational policy evaluations that quantify both intended and unintended spillover effects.

        <title>What is mathematics teaching talk for? A response based on three sites of practice in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During the last decades, the study of how learners and teachers of mathematics use the resource of language has contributed to our understanding of mathematics teaching and learning in a variety of classrooms and cultures. Developmental work with mathematics teachers on the particular resource of mathematics teaching talk is more recent. In order to explore responses related to the importance of this talk, in this paper we consider three sites of practice in mathematics education—research, professional development and teaching—and illustrations of data from or about them, including studies from the literature, and work with secondary school mathematics teachers in Catalonia-Spain and Malawi around the teaching of angles. We argue that tensions permeate these sites of practice when a focus is placed on word use, specifically the practices of naming and explaining, in mathematics teaching talk. We conclude that the importance of mathematics teaching talk is construed through tensions with other resources in language and teaching. Tensions specifically appear in the realisation of mathematics teaching talk as mediational in the work with mathematics teachers on their classroom teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
