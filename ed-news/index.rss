        <title>Considering Race in Teacher Well-Being</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Despite evidence that teachers’ professional experiences are racialized, few studies have quantitatively examined possible racial disparities in teachers’ job satisfaction. Using data from a nationally representative survey of teachers in the United States, we find that Black teachers report significantly lower job satisfaction than their White colleagues. Moreover, we find that teacher perceptions of school safety are the primary predictor of this gap in job satisfaction. We argue that centralizing race and racialized experiences in consideration of teacher job satisfaction will open new sites of inquiry in educational research and can guide educational policy to promote equity in K–12 schools.

        <title>The PRIUM qualitative framework for assessment of proof comprehension: a result of collaboration among mathematicians and mathematics educators</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;While proof has been studied from different perspectives in the mathematics education literature for decades, students continue to struggle to build proof comprehension. Complicating this, the manner in which proof comprehension is assessed largely remains to be the definition-theorem-proof format in which students are asked to reproduce proofs or similar proofs that are presented in class. This approach can encourage students to memorize proofs rather than develop tools for syllogistic reasoning. This paper reports on a seven-year collaboration among research mathematicians and mathematics educators. Following a model for proof comprehension, they implemented a cycle of planning assessments, implementing them and evaluating student responses in several courses each semester for three years at two universities. The model-based assessments were designed with probing questions about proofs or subproofs to point student attention to the relationships among definitions, statements and their relationships, as well as the logic used to help students to both develop proof knowledge and demonstrate their mathematical thinking. Discrepancies between the intention of assessments and student responses led to refinements as the team reviewed the results to inform its practice. Collaboration, experience and empirical data informed the development of the new &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Promoting Reasoning in Undergraduate Mathematics &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;(PRIUM) Qualitative Framework for Proof Comprehension&lt;/em&gt;. The paper discusses three main results: the Framework and how to use it, the Framework’s utility at the individual, course and program levels of departmental evaluation, and a collaborative research process that may be utilized between research mathematics educators and mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Examining Power Through Practice in Continuous Improvement in Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this conceptual article, we argue for the need to examine power relations in continuous improvement (CI) in education. Specifically, we contend that examining power in CI requires an examination of practices that constitute the work of CI. Drawing on practice theory, we conceptualize practice and power and use these constructs to examine a CI effort on improving mathematical proficiency in an elementary school. From this case, we draw out three power moves to illustrate how examining power through practice in CI can generate insight into the varied power dynamics in a CI effort. We end by arguing for more examinations into the practice of CI work to understand power relations and the enactment of CI efforts in education broadly.

        <title>Metacognitive control during problem solving at early ages in programming tasks using a floor robot</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This research, following a sequential mixed-methods design, delves into metacognitive control in problem solving among 5- to 6-year-olds, using two floor-robot environments. In an initial qualitative phase, 82 pupils participated in tasks in which they directed a floor robot to one of two targets, with the closer target requiring more cognitive effort due to the turns involved. The results of this phase revealed that younger students often rationalised their decisions based on reasons unrelated to the difficulty of the task, highlighting limitations in children’s language and abstract thinking skills and leading to the need for a second quantitative study. In this subsequent stage, involving 117 students, a computerised floor-robot simulator was used. The simulator executed the students’ planned movements and provided feedback on their validity. Each participant had three attempts per problem, with the option to change their target each time. The simulator stored the information pertaining to the chosen resolution path, design of the plan, and re-evaluation of decision making based on the results and feedback received. This study aims to describe the criteria upon which students base their metacognitive control processes in decision making within problem-solving programming tasks. Additionally, through a comparative analysis focusing on age and gender, this research aims to assess the relationship between metacognitive processes and success in problem-solving programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Epistemic emotions and pre-service mathematics teachers’ knowledge for teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Affective and cognitive processes may be jointly researched to better understand mathematics learning, paying special interest to emotions related to knowledge acquisition. However, it remains necessary to explore these processes in studies linked to the education of pre-service mathematics teachers. This study aims to characterize epistemic emotions in different practices linked to the practice of mathematics teaching: problem-solving, anticipating what would happen with the students and reflecting on classroom implementation. It considers the theory of Mathematical Working Spaces to describe the mathematical and cognitive dimensions generated by epistemic emotions, paying special attention to the cognition-affect interaction and the workspace created. The results indicate that the epistemic emotions of the pre-service mathematics teachers associated with the distinct practices were different. Differences are observed in the interaction between emotions and cognitive epistemic actions, depending on whether the pre-service mathematics teachers analyze them within the framework of their own solving or anticipate them in their students. This reveals how personal work relates to what is considered to be suitable for students. Specifically, certain antecedents and consequences have been specified for the emotions of surprise and boredom in relation to the characteristics of the optimization problems and the cognitive activity of the subject when solving them. These results highlight the need to enhance the education of pre-service mathematics teachers through training that helps regulate their epistemic emotions and model effective strategies for regulating their own emotions and those of their students.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Facilitating collaborative inquiry into practice around artifacts of mathematics teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although there has been increasing attention to the importance of teacher agency in professional development, there has been little attention to what it takes to facilitate collaborative work that both centers teachers’ assets and expertise and leads to productive learning. This paper presents a framework for focused and responsive facilitation of productive discourse around instructional practice in teacher learning communities. Drawing on a situative perspective, we trace the development of six novice teacher leaders as they were mentored to lead online collaborative lesson design groups focused on analyzing artifacts of K-8 mathematics instruction in a large urban district in the US. Our framework articulates how leaders facilitated the discussions in ways that both built on teacher knowledge, experiences, and contributions while also focusing on professional learning goals. Our analysis also shows how rich learning opportunities were co-constructed and sustained by the mentors, teacher leaders, and participants in each group over time. Through narrative descriptions of one group, we show how the teacher participants began to take on some of the facilitation practices themselves as they apprenticed into the practices of the community. This approach to professional learning positions teachers’ experience and knowledge as important assets while supporting them to try out and reflect on new classroom practices.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Department-Wide Transition to a New Mode of Computer-Aided Assessment Using STACK</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We focus on the integration of STACK—a Computer-Aided Assessment (CAA) technology—in the mathematics department of a high-ranking University in the United Kingdom. We study a department-wide project where instructors were expected to implement STACK into continuous assessment tasks for (nearly) all core modules across the first two years of undergraduate study. We present this work as a departmental case study, drawing on semi-structured interviews with six novice STACK assessment designers (and module leaders), supplemented by students’ responses to an open-response feedback questionnaire, and the reflections of a co-project lead (also first author). Our thematic analysis identified four themes related to the design of STACK-based assessments by novice to STACK tutors: the process of ‘STACKification’, technical challenges, users’ perspectives on the role of CAA, and finally, variations in assessment designers’ approaches to the role of feedback. In presenting our results, we are guided by Sangwin’s (&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r18&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;) design principles for mathematics assessment. We consider various technical aspects of implementing STACK-based assessments as a first-time user, and the knowledge required to do so effectively and coherently. We conclude with a series of reflections on the role of CAA in undergraduate mathematics, and the ways in which such technology can be productively integrated with established practice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Family-Centered Approach to Learning English as a Second Language: A Mixed-Methods Experimental Evaluation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We present the 2-year experimental mixed-methods findings of a two-generation English as a second language (ESL) program. This program combines a high-dosage, child-oriented curriculum for parents with Head Start for children in addition to family-based supportive services. At baseline and after 2 years, 189 Latinx and Zomi immigrant parents completed surveys while children completed skill assessments. A subset of 67 parents participated in focus groups regarding their experiences. Treatment parents reported significantly higher English writing skills and self-esteem and significantly lower language brokering and material hardship. There were no significant differences in children’s outcomes. Possible explanatory mechanisms across multiple contexts were identified in the qualitative data. Evidence is promising that a Two-Generation ESL Program improves some outcomes for parents.

        <title>Early Algebra Affects Peer Composition</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although research indicates that individual students benefit when they enroll in early algebra classes, evaluations of broad-based algebra acceleration often report negative effects. Using a regression discontinuity design, we replicate the positive effects of eighth-grade algebra placement on student achievement found in prior studies. We then demonstrate that eighth-grade algebra placement positively affects the achievement level of students’ classmates, as well as the experience and value added of students’ math teachers. Peer composition effects may help to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the positive effects of algebra on individual students and negative effects of algebra acceleration since these estimated effects are large enough to plausibly explain the majority of the effects of eighth-grade algebra on student test scores.

        <title>Students’ use of generative artificial intelligence for proving mathematical statements</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this exploratory study, we investigate undergraduate students’ engagement with generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) in proving mathematical statements. We selected six mathematical statements to conduct interviews with three students. We present the emergent framework, Students’ Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students’ use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students’ use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Forms of Structuring Space by Linear Algebra Students with Video Games and GeoGebra</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this article we analyze how students reason about linear combinations across multiple digital environments. We present the work of three groups of undergraduate students in the Southeast United States (US) who were considered ready to take linear algebra. The students played the game &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vector Unknown&lt;/em&gt;, reflected upon aspects of their gameplay using GeoGebra, and used that knowledge to design a level for a 3D version of the game under some constraints. We performed a grounded qualitative analysis of each student’s activity to identify key episodes of student reasoning about linear combinations using technology. Both authors reviewed the episodes and categorized them according to the type of student activity. We compared their reasoning in 2D and 3D space to understand how they made the transition and finally linked these episodes to the technology used to understand its role in building student understanding. We identify four forms of structuring space: Reasoning with Numeric Sums, Reasoning with Resultant Vectors, Reasoning with Tip-to-Tail Vectors, and Reasoning with Vectors as Points. We found that how the technology represented vectors and linear combinations influenced how students engaged in structuring space.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Puts the ‘Active’ into ‘Active Learning’?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Learning is here considered to have taken place when someone has developed the habit, propensity, and disposition to attend productively to things not previously noticed, and in ways not previously experienced, to do with some specific and particular content. ‘Active learning’ sounds like a tautology, but was introduced as a contrast to the more passive activity of students sitting in lectures listening and transcribing mathematics written on a board or screen onto their own paper. The stance taken here is that effective and efficient learning involves active engagement in activity, but includes enculturation through being in the presence of a relative expert&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; who themselves is manifesting mathematical thinking, not simply passing on the records of the results of previous mathematical thought. Such ‘passivity’ does not necessarily require intention. Following Bennett&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;actions are here taken to involve three agents or impulses: initiating, responding, and reconciling or mediating. All three agents are thus active, but in different ways. Interactions intended to contribute to learning are considered to be actions, and so involve three agents: learner, teacher (in some manifestation), and mathematical content, all within a culture or ethos. Since there are six different ways in which the triple of agents can be assigned to the triple of impulses, six different modes are possible. Analysing these modes sheds light on different ways in which learning could be said to be ‘active’. Activity takes place within a mode of interaction. Again following Bennett, effective activity is here taken to require appropriate relationships among the gap between current state and intended goal, the resources available, and the tasks set.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Vygotsky (1978) pointed out that ‘higher psychological processes’ are first encountered in others.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Bennett (1993); see also Shantock Systematics Group (1975)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tensions as springboards to actions in a partnership between mathematics teachers and mathematics education researchers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research–practice partnerships around educational research may have beneficial outcomes but also present tensions. By considering the dynamics of manifested tensions, our study aims to understand how teachers engage with the various stages of the research in an inquiry-based professional development community consisting of eleven in-service teachers and three mathematics education researchers. In light of Heider&#39;s Balance Theory, we identify and analyze tensions expressed by teachers in the community discourse. Findings indicate that epistemic tensions related to teachers&#39; and researchers&#39; different cultural orientations act as powerful generators of inclusionary and exclusionary actions shaping community members&#39; participation paths. While downplaying epistemic tensions can evoke individual actions detrimental to learning and destructive to the community&#39;s existence, awareness of and well-timed coping with tensions can become a springboard for community development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Walking the Talk: Engendering a “Community of Teachers” in an Educator Preparation Program in the Southern United States</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, the Education Studies Department (ESD) at Berea College shares lessons learned while becoming an inclusive, justice-focused, and democratic Education Preparation Program (EPP) together with its “Community of Teachers” (CoT). ESD values diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI+B) and democratic relationships. These values influence how we do our work. We begin by sharing how the theoretical framework of Community of Practice (CoP) frames our case study. After explaining how a CoP applies to ESD’s approach to educator preparation, we give an overview of Berea College. We share some of its history and its eight Great Commitments. We detail how ESD is a unique EPP compared with other more traditional EPPs. Next, we chronicle the story of how ESD “walks its talk” and invests in the teacher profession. We detail the participants of the case study, outline our methodology of the case study, and share the data we analyzed for this article. Data were analyzed and three emergent themes were discovered about the praxis of ESD: (a) community-engaged and justice-focused teacher preparation, (b) community building within teacher preparation programs, and (c) diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. The article concludes by sharing implications for EPPs and a conclusion.

        <title>Does Knowing the Word Matter for Preschool DLLS? Individualized Vocabulary Words on Phonological Awareness Performance</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Early literacy assessment has become commonplace in the preschool years, with phonological awareness constituting one component of emergent literacy targeted by such practices. This within-subjects experimental study examines the role of word familiarity on 93 dual language preschoolers’ performance on phoneme-level awareness tasks in three-phoneme words. A researcher-designed digital tool created individualized test items (foils and target responses) for each child. Half of the items presented target responses that contained familiar words, and half contained unfamiliar words. Results suggest unknown/unfamiliar target words yield lower phonological awareness performance scores.

        <title>Undergraduate Grading Practices of International and Domestic Faculty: Evidence From Three Large U.S. Public Universities</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Given the prominence of international instructors in higher education, understanding their grading practices is essential for informing college grading debates. This first large-scale assessment of undergraduate grading practices highlights how different demographic, classroom and departmental factors shape international instructors’ grading behaviors. Using a unique dataset of over 2,000 randomly selected instructors from three public universities, we examine (a) whether undergraduate-level grading practices differ between domestic and international instructors, (b) what factors contribute to the differences, and (c) whether the differences vary across key subgroups. We find that international instructors grade lower than domestic instructors—about 35% of a standard deviation lower on average. Part of this gap is explained by the concentration of international instructors in particular departments. International instructor grading practices differ across regions of origin, prior U.S. higher education experience, gender, and race. Our results provide insights into U.S. college grading debates and supporting the international instructor workforce.

        <title>The State of Elementary School Recess in Georgia: Policy, the Pandemic, and Patterns of Play</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While we continue to see a growing push for the restoration and codification of recess in elementary schools, policy does not necessarily equal practice. Georgia recently passed legislation requiring at least 20 minutes of recess per day for students in PK-5. The purpose of this research study was to survey elementary school educators to reveal the temporal (i.e., duration, frequency, and cancellation practices) and descriptive (i.e., type, equipment, place) characteristics of recess in Georgia’s public elementary schools. The results of this study, which can be summed up statistically and descriptively as less recess overall, and less free play specifically, as well as reduced access to safe play spaces since the onset of the pandemic, yield important policy implications for Georgia’s school children. These implications relate to persistent disparities in immediate and long-term positive outcomes for children across multiple domains including academic, social-emotional, and behavioral.

        <title>Race Placed: Special Education Identification and Placement of Black Students</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study investigates the overrepresentation of Black students in special education by looking at the association of race and related variables with referral, identification, and placement. Analyses were performed on a statewide sample of students and teachers to investigate relationships between student, teacher and school demographics, and special education identification and placement. The results find (1) black students assigned to black teachers are less likely to be identified for special services, (2) black students are less likely to be in inclusive placements with increases in white student enrollment, and (3) black students are more likely to be identified for special services and placed in more restrictive settings.

        <title>Traits of generalization of problem solution methods exhibited by potential mathematically gifted students when solving problems in a selection process</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Identifying mathematically gifted students is an important objective in mathematics education. To describe skills typical of these students, researchers pose problems in several mathematical domains whose solutions require using different mathematical capacities, such as visualization, generalization, proof, creativity, etc. This paper presents an analysis of the solutions to two problems by 75 students (aged 11–14), as part of the selection test for a workshop to stimulate mathematical talent. These problems require the use of the capacity for mathematical generalization of solution methods. We define a set of descriptors of such capacity, use them to analyze students’ solutions, and evaluate how well students with high capacity for generalization can be distinguished from average students. The results indicate that the two problems are suitable for identifying potential mathematically gifted students and several descriptors have high discriminatory power to identify students with high or low capacity for generalization.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using a Deep Learning-Based Visual Computational Model to Identify Cognitive Strategies in Matrix Reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.
