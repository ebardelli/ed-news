        <title>Eighteenth Annual AERA Brown Lecture in Education Research Still Climbing the Hill: Intersectional Reflections on Brown and Beyond</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman’s poem “The Hill We Climb”—among the most powerful moments of the 2021 presidential inauguration—inspired the central inquiry of the 18th Annual Brown Lecture in Education Research: Why are we still climbing the hill of educational equity 67 years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education? The purpose of this article is to challenge dominant narratives surrounding Brown and introduce perspectives that might help account for a general lack of progress—perspectives that typically are overlooked or erased in wider Brown discourses. Inspired by her poem, Patton Davis offers a scholarly analysis and contributes a robust understanding of Brown and its historical and contemporary meanings in the sociopolitical contexts of racism and white supremacy. Patton Davis considers pressing questions: How can study of the circumstances that have intensified the COVID-19 pandemic fuel collective understanding of racial inequities and intersectional injustices in education? How might a critical race lens guide educators, policymakers, and researchers toward a more progressive realization of the promises of Brown? What would it take for education researchers, the majority of whom are situated in postsecondary settings, to engage in activism modeled after the work of communities still fighting for the racial and educational equity envisioned in Brown?

        <title>Investing in the Teacher Workforce: Experimental Evidence on Teachers’ Preferences</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Inadequate compensation is often viewed as the root of teacher workforce challenges despite teacher reports that working conditions matter more. Using an original discrete choice experiment with a national sample of 1,030 U.S. teachers, we found that support staff—special education specialists, counselors, and nurses—play an essential role in shaping teachers’ employment preferences. Teachers value access to these support staff more than they value a 10% increase to their own salary. We also assessed teachers’ preferences regarding childcare subsidies and find that teachers treat a 10% salary increase and a childcare benefit of similar value as near perfect substitutes. To test the durability of these findings, we replicated our study 2 years later and found nearly identical results.

        <title>A review of lesson study in mathematics education from 2015 to 2022: implementation and impact</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lesson study (LS), a teacher-oriented, student-focused professional development (PD) approach that originated in Japan, has spread globally. However, existing literature on the implementation of LS and its effectiveness provides inconsistent results, suggesting a need to review current research on LS. With a focus on LS in mathematics education, we examined 75 recent LS studies using Lewis’s (ZDM Mathematics Education 48:571–580, 2016. &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus non-url-ref&quot;&gt;doi.org/10.1007/s11858-016-0792-x&lt;/span&gt;) framework to understand how LS is implemented and the pathways by which LS can impact teaching practice and student learning. We found that new developments have taken place in LS implementation, although challenges persist throughout its process. Regarding the implementation of LS, even though the examined LS studies generally contained four phases (study, plan, teach, and reflect), we found many LS lacked a research question, and the study of teaching materials was sometimes invisible. Across phases, studies shared a consensus that it is most critical to focus on students’ thinking and learning, yet reported challenges in maintaining this focus. In addition, the role of knowledgeable others (KOs) was recognized but inconsistently understood. Collaboration was also widely reported as a challenge. Finally, there were large variations in LS duration, with some LS implementing overly brief cycles. Regarding LS impact, the literature has more frequently reported changes in teachers’ knowledge and beliefs and less frequently in curriculum, learning community/professional norms, teaching practice, and student learning outcomes. The above challenges reflect a need for culturally relevant systemic support for developing sustainable and large-scale LS. We suggest future directions for continued research and practice improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Early numeracy opportunities through number stories with marginalised families</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We explore the potential of merging numeracy and literacy, through using number stories to stimulate mathematical engagement with young, marginalized learners in their communities. Our data emerges from the Family Maths Storytime Programme (FMSP) run in partnership with teachers in two South African schools. The FMSP conducted sessions with caregivers of pre-Grade 1 learners that focused on supporting mathematical talk in the home centred around four number storybooks with linked activities and games. Drawing on Bourdieu’s notion of habitus and other socio-cultural theories emphasising opportunities for talk and reasoning for learning we explore: Did the FMSP enable the integration of home and school numeracy and literacy practices? If so, what evidence is there of such integrated practices? What is the nature of the described practices? Our analysis focuses on 20 caregiver interviews following their participation in the FMSP that was initially run after school in two English medium pre-Grade 1 classrooms. NVivo coding highlighted key themes across interviews. The findings show how modelling engagement with merged literacy and numeracy practices in the programme enabled changing practices, dispositions, and forms of capital in relation to engaging with these in the home. We highlight how supporting home-based and story inspired engagement with marginalised learners supports equity goals in contexts where learners from indigenous backgrounds often begin and remain mathematically behind grade expectations in school.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Impacts of Viewpoint Diversity Law on Teaching and Learning in Florida’s State Universities</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study explores the impact of Florida House Bill 233 on teaching and learning in Florida’s State University System. This bill purports to promote intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by permitting students to record classes and by creating a cause of action for faculty violating these principles. Faculty were invited to share qualitative feedback about the specific impacts of the two provisions. The vast majority of faculty expressed negative views of these provisions, suggesting they would inhibit intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by deterring student participation in classes, discouraging faculty from engaging students in discussions of certain topics, and creating an atmosphere of mistrust between faculty and students. Faculty with positive views of the recording provision suggested that these provisions promote intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by discouraging faculty from imposing their views and giving students a remedy if they feel that faculty are violating their rights.

        <title>Mixed-Effects Location Scale Models for Joint Modeling School Value-Added Effects on the Mean and Variance of Student Achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School value-added models are widely applied to study, monitor, and hold schools to account for school differences in student learning. The traditional model is a mixed-effects linear regression of student current achievement on student prior achievement, background characteristics, and a school random intercept effect. The latter is referred to as the school value-added score and measures the mean student covariate-adjusted achievement in each school. In this article, we argue that further insights may be gained by additionally studying the variance in this quantity in each school. These include the ability to identify both individual schools and school types that exhibit unusually high or low variability in student achievement, even after accounting for differences in student intakes. We explore and illustrate how this can be done via fitting mixed-effects location scale versions of the traditional school value-added model. We discuss the implications of our work for research and school accountability systems.

        <title>A Comparison of Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Educational Measurement</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Topic models are mathematical and statistical models used to analyze textual data. The objective of topic models is to gain information about the latent semantic space of a set of related textual data. The semantic space of a set of textual data contains the relationship between documents and words and how they are used. Topic models are becoming more common in educational measurement research as a method for analyzing students’ responses to constructed-response items. Two popular topic models are latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LSA uses linear algebra techniques, whereas LDA uses an assumed statistical model and generative process. In educational measurement, LSA is often used in algorithmic scoring of essays due to its high reliability and agreement with human raters. LDA is often used as a supplemental analysis to gain additional information about students, such as their thinking and reasoning. This article reviews and compares the LSA and LDA topic models. This article also introduces a methodology for comparing the semantic spaces obtained by the two models and uses a simulation study to investigate their similarities.

        <title>Relational-Curiosity and Mathematics: A Dynamic Exploration of DataViz</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper examines preservice teachers’ experiences when they engage with tasks using dynamic technological applets to analyse data pertaining to societal issues. We examine two vignettes that discuss preservice teachers’ interaction with dynamic visual representations of data related to plastic pollution and food supply. We analyse this data with an eye toward the relationship between the affordances of the technology and the emergence of participants’ curiosity. We adopt the Embodied Curiosity theoretical lens to show how the foundational construct, relational-curiosity, provides opportunities for curiosity to be visible and recognized as a tool for meaning-making. This research provides insights into how preservice teachers can mitigate the challenges and tensions they face when navigating connections between mathematics and social justice issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Relationships Between State Higher Education Funding Strategies and College Access and Success</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We compiled the first longitudinal data set with detailed state funding information to examine whether different funding strategies for public higher education correlate with college access and completion, with a focus on outcomes among racially minoritized students. We found no relationships between funding mechanisms and student outcomes at public universities. However, at community colleges, we found that funding strategies that combine base adjustments and enrollment or performance components may increase enrollment, but not completions.

        <title>The Promise of Tutoring for PreK–12 Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Experimental Evidence</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Tutoring ranks among the most versatile and potentially transformative educational tools available. Dozens of randomized experiments have evaluated preK–12 tutoring programs, varying widely in approaches, contexts, and costs. This article presents results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of tutoring field experiments. We develop a framework for understanding variation in tutoring program impact and examine effect sizes (ESs) across a range of characteristics. We find that tutoring programs yield consistently substantial positive impacts on learning, with an overall pooled ES of 0.288 SD (SE = 0.029, p &amp;lt; .001). ESs tend to be largest for programs that use teachers or paraprofessionals as tutors, are held in earlier grades, occur at least 3 days per week, and are held during school.

        <title>Exploring cultural dynamism of ethnomodelling as a pedagogical action for students from minority cultural groups</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics education is inherent to the discourse of globalization, which often states that mathematical knowledge is universal. Certain global mathematical techniques and procedures found in many mathematics curricula around the world often discourage students to engage in creating their own mathematical knowledge. This suggests that dominant cultural values are defined as universal or at the very least labeled as normative, while peripheral mathematical knowledge is tagged as merely simplistic, primitivistic, folkloristic, and/or as forms of obsolete systems. Our main purpose here is to discuss how ethnomodelling promotes a holistic understanding of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; approaches in mathematics education, which contributes to the development of a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;glocal&lt;/em&gt; comprehension of mathematical practices developed by members of distinct cultures, which means placing them at the center of the educational process. Through the development of ethnomodelling, this pedagogical action promotes connections between day-to-day knowledge and systematized school curricula. Thus, this theoretical article demonstrates how we might consider situating local mathematical practices (margins) at the center (glocal) of the mathematics education process by decentering globalized mathematical knowledge in the search for peace and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Family Perspectives of University Reading Clinic/Literacy Lab Experiences: What Matters</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Family partnerships should be a central component of teacher preparation. Although research provides family engagement strategies, little research offers teacher educators guidance from the perspectives of families themselves. The purpose of this convergent mixed-method study was to begin to fill the void in the literature by investigating family perspectives of theirs and their children’s experience in 10 reading clinic/literacy lab literacy specialist preparation programs across the United States and Canada. Through analysis of survey ratings (N = 132) and responses to structured interviews to (N = 84), this study found that families valued clinic/lab tutors building relationships with them, responding to their children’s strengths and needs, promoting self-efficacy, and working together as partners. Methods used in this study can provide a useful model for how teacher educators can intentionally seek input from families. Findings have implications for teacher educators advocating for and centering family engagement in teacher preparation.

        <title>Organizing Possible Futures: A Systematic Review on Dis/ability Justice Frameworks to Design Equity-Oriented Inclusive Teacher Education Programs</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the U.S. school system, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) students often experience multiple forms of marginalization at the intersection of racism, ableism, and other forms of subjugation. To reform dysfunctional school systems, teacher education programs must create transformative spaces to nurture future educators committed to equity. These educators then will be equipped to dismantle the (in)visible racist and ableist structures within education systems and envision new alternative futures. Drawing on critical learning sciences and dis/ability justice-oriented theoretical approaches, we conducted a systematic literature review of 11 empirical studies to examine how teacher preparation programs are informed by dis/ability justice theoretical lenses. We synthesized how dis/ability justice-oriented teacher preparation programs organized transformative learning environments aimed at disrupting color-evasive and pathologizing discourses. We discussed the findings on how these programs conceptualized dis/ability, their applications of these conceptualizations in practice, and the transformative learning outcomes for preservice teachers.

        <title>Peer Relationships and Chinese Adolescents’ Academic Achievement: Selection and Influence</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study applied Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis to disentangle friendship selection and influence regarding the academic achievement of Chinese adolescents in a 3-year longitudinal study of 880 middle school students (400 girls, Year 1 mean age = 13.33) and 525 high school students (284 girls, mean age = 16.45). Both peer selection and influence effects were obtained. Chinese adolescents preferred friendships with similarly achieving or higher achieving peers but avoided friendships with lower achieving peers. They increased achievement when they befriended high-achieving peers but decreased achievement when they befriended low-achieving peers. Influence but not selection was stronger for middle school students than for high school students. The results may be a function of the importance of academic success for Chinese students.
