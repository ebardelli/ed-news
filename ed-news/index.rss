        <title>Preparing middle and high school teachers for teaching mathematical modeling: building curriculum vision and trust through curricular and professional noticing</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Preservice teachers need more opportunities to learn about mathematical modeling, and the field needs more research-based knowledge about effective course design, strategies, and practices to foster preservice teachers’ professional competency for teaching mathematical modeling. This case study examined how curricular and professional noticing frameworks helped preservice teachers develop curriculum vision and curriculum trust. Eight preservice mathematics teachers enrolled in a secondary (6–12) teacher preparation program participated in a 15-week professional development seminar series in which they (a) analyzed model eliciting activities and made sense of their curricular and pedagogical opportunities, (b) planned and enacted modeling tasks, and (c) reflected on their enactment through the lens of curricular and professional noticing. The results of this study suggest that using curricular and professional noticing can help preservice teachers recognize and make sense of the design principles of modeling tasks, the long-term learning goals afforded by the tasks, and potential implementation obstacles. However, developing curriculum vision seems to be easier than developing curriculum trust. Our analyses provide pedagogical implications for mathematics teacher education and professional development in order to better prepare mathematics teachers for the instruction of mathematical modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tools to support learning to plan discussions that promote students’ mathematical reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigate pre-service teachers’ learning to plan discussions promoting students’ mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we analyse opportunities to learn to plan provided by three planning tools: a conceptual framework of the mathematical work of reasoning and proving, a set of talk moves, and a mathematical task with students’ work. In learning cycles, the pre-service teachers investigated, planned, enacted, and reflected on practice, using role-plays as an approximation to practice. The planning was organised in small groups, and these groups’ collaborative work was videotaped, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Our findings reveal three patterns of tool use: tools as a support for planning, planning as a context to make sense of the tools, and the use of talk moves to plan when the students’ work was insufficient as a support. From these patterns, we identify several opportunities to learn afforded by the tools. However, we also identify and discuss limitations in the design of the tools, particularly related to mathematical reasoning. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Initiating a conversation about expertise in designing elementary mathematics methods courses for equity</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many elementary education programs have only one mathematics methods course designed for preservice teachers (PTs). Such courses typically cover a range of content and present a challenge for mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) who strive to prepare their PTs to teach mathematics in equitable and humane ways. Due to the “stand-alone” nature of these semester-long courses, additional expertise is required for MTEs who desire to intentionally and authentically attend to equity and support PTs in developing pedagogy that aims for equity as outlined by (Gutiérrez, in: Herbel-Eisenmann, Choppin, Wagner, Pimm (eds) Equity in discourse for mathematics education, Springer, Berlin, 2012). In this paper, we take a first step at outlining this expertise by proffering a framework for conceptualizing MTE curricular knowledge for designing mathematics methods courses for equity. Using 12 syllabi for stand-alone elementary mathematics methods courses in initial teacher licensure programs from MTEs who have demonstrated expertise in the field of equitable mathematics teaching (MTE-EEs), we examined how aspects of their curricular expertise were evidenced in course descriptions, goals, objectives, assignments, topics, and related readings. Findings indicated that MTE-EEs often included similar design features in their courses and concentrated their attention to equity on access and identity. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Validating Classrooms: Teaching Strategies to Advance Equity in Developmental Education</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Research on developmental education reform has given surprisingly limited attention to what happens inside the classroom between faculty and students. Our qualitative study used interview data from 20 faculty and 20 students in corequisite math and English courses at one of the nation’s largest and most racially diverse community college systems. Specifically, we used validation theory to examine faculty teaching strategies and support structures that may increase academic success among corequisite students. Our findings demonstrate that the most effective faculty, who often had course pass rates 20% above the institutional average, created validating learning environments that addressed students’ academic and interpersonal needs. We provide recommendations for expanding the use of validating teaching and learning practices in corequisite-developmental education courses to ensure more equitable student outcomes.

        <title>On synthetic difference-in-differences and related estimation methods in Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 557-598, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we describe a computational implementation of the synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID) estimator of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021, American Economic Review 111: 4088-4118) for Stata. SDID can be used in many circumstances where treatment effects on some particular policy or event are desired and repeated observations on treated and untreated units are available over time. We lay out the theory underlying SDID both when there is a single treatment adoption date and when adoption is staggered over time, and we discuss estimation and inference in each of these cases. We introduce the sdid command, which implements these methods in Stata, and provide several examples of use, discussing estimation, inference, and visualization of results. Along with SDID, the sdid command allows for the implementation of standard synthetic control and difference-in-differences methods in an identical framework, permitting estimation, inference, and the generation of graphical output in a computationally efficient way.

        <title>require: Package dependencies for reproducible research</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 599-613, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The ability to conduct reproducible research in Stata is often limited by the lack of version control for community-contributed packages. In this article, we introduce the require command, a tool designed to ensure package dependencies are compatible across users and computer systems. Given a list of packages, require verifies that each package is installed, checks for a minimum or exact version or package release date, and optionally installs the package if prompted by the researcher.

        <title>Estimating treatment effects when program participation is misreported</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 614-629, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Instrumental variables are commonly used to estimate treatment effects in cases of imperfect compliance. However, if participation in the program is misreported, standard techniques can yield severely biased results. We present a new command, ivreg2m, that implements the mismeasured robust local average treatment-effect estimator developed by Calvi, Lewbel, and Tommasi (2022, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 40: 1701–1717) and Tommasi and Zhang (2024b, Journal of Applied Econometrics, doi.org/10.1002/jae.3079), to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effect of a program in the presence of treatment noncompliance and misreporting. The ivreg2m command can be used as the preferred strategy in cases of exogenous (nondifferential) misclassification.

        <title>Outlier detection for inequality and poverty analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 630-665, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Extreme values are common in survey data and represent a recurring threat to the reliability of both poverty and inequality estimates. The adoption of a consistent criterion for outlier detection is useful in many practical applications, particularly when international and intertemporal comparisons are involved. In this article, we discuss a simple univariate detection procedure to flag outliers. We present outdetect, a command that implements the procedure and provides useful diagnostic tools. The output of outdetect compares statistics obtained before and after the exclusion of outliers, with a focus on inequality and poverty measures. Finally, we carry out an extensive sensitivity exercise where the same outlier detection method is applied consistently to per capita expenditure across more than 30 household budget surveys. The results are clear and provide a sense of the influence of extreme values on poverty and inequality estimates.

        <title>Distinguishing differences in construct from differences in response style: gsem for item response theory models with anchoring vignettes</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 666-686, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Item response theory models allow estimation of participant and group-mean trait scores from responses to a set of items, but estimates can be biased when participants vary in their response style. We illustrate models fit in gsem that can account for such response style differences by comparing self-report with their ratings of anchoring vignettes—descriptions of other individuals displaying different levels of the trait. Simulation results from standard item response theory, mean bias, random bias, and free-threshold models are illustrated. We show that unbiased estimates can be recovered when the vignettes rated depend on the participants’ own self-rating or are even rated by a different sample, substantially broadening their scope of application.

        <title>gtsheckman: Generalized two-step Heckman estimator</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 687-710, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, I introduce the gtsheckman command, which estimates a generalized two-step Heckman sample-selection estimator adjusted for heteroskedasticity. This estimator has been previously proposed in Carlson and Joshi (2024, Journal of Applied Econometrics 39: 237-255), where the presence of heteroskedasticity was motivated by a panel-data setting with random coefficients. The gtsheckman command offers several advantages over the heckman, twostep command, including robust inference, a more general control function specification, and the incorporation of heteroskedasticity. I discuss syntax and the underlying methodology and provide examples showing how the gtsheckman command can be used in a variety of settings

        <title>Cluster-weighted models using Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 711-745, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The cluster-weighted model (CWM) is a member of the family of mixtures of regression models and is also known as a mixture of regressions with random covariates. CWMs refer to the framework of model-based clustering and naturally apply when the research interest requires modeling the relationship between a response variable and a set of covariates using a regression-based approach such as a generalized linear model with the sample being suspected of comprising heterogeneous latent classes. A command for fitting these models is not yet available in Stata, so the aim of this article is to introduce the package cwmglm, which fits CWMs based on the most common generalized linear models with random covariates. Moreover, cwmglm allows the estimation of parsimonious models of Gaussian distributions, with the parameterization of the variance–covariance matrix based on the eigenvalue decomposition. These features are completely new for Stata users. The cwmglm package features goodness-of-fit, bootstrapping, and model-selection tools. We illustrate the use of cwmglm with real and simulated datasets.

        <title>Calculating the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) using Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/4&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 746-765, December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a standardized, survey-based tool that has been widely used to track gender equality and measure empowerment, agency, and women’s inclusion in the agricultural sector (Alkire et al., 2013, World Development 52: 71–91). Since the WEAI’s release in 2012, an abbreviated version of the WEAI (A-WEAI) and a project-level version of the WEAI (pro-WEAI) have been developed (Malapit et al., 2017, The abbreviated Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index [A-WEAI]; Malapit et al., 2019, Development of the project-level Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index [pro-WEAI]). In this article, we review the shared methodology that underlies all members of the WEAI family of indices and introduce a command, weai, that can be used for index calculation. We describe the command and its options and provide empirical examples using publicly available data from the Gender, Agriculture, and Assets Project, Phase 2.

        <title>Speaking Stata: Getting by without the by() option: Some graphics for unequal groups</title>

If groups are unequal in size, the result may seem awkward or inefficient in use of space. Devices to allow such groups to be shown directly without using a by() option are explained and exemplified for graph dot and its siblings and for graph twoway.New variables to show rank within groups and (if needed) separation of groups are easily constructed. Group summaries such as medians may easily be added. Graph types shown are dot charts, quantile plots, and displays using spikes to show differences between variables. Data examples are for ocean salinity and changes in weight of anorexic girls.

        <title>Teacher Self-Efficacy, Instructional Practice, and Student Outcomes: Evidence from the TALIS Video Study</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this paper we use novel data to test the direct and indirect paths between teacher self-efficacy and student outcomes. This includes how teacher self-efficacy is linked to student, teacher, and expert rater views of lesson quality. Our results illustrate how the link between teacher self-efficacy and instructional quality is sensitive to how lesson quality is measured, with large effects when based on teacher reported outcomes but no association when based on the ratings of expert observers. Virtually no relationship is found between teacher self-efficacy and student outcomes. We thus conclude that while there is probably some positive association between teacher self-efficacy and the quality of their instruction, the strength of this relationship is relatively weak.
