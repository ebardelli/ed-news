        <title>A decade of PISA: student perceived instructional quality and mathematics achievement across European countries</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines the relationship between instructional quality and mathematics achievement, taking into account socioeconomic status. Data from ten European countries participating in PISA 2012 and 2022 were analysed using the framework of the Dynamic Modelling of Educational Effectiveness. In PISA 2012, instructional quality was defined by student-oriented instruction, classroom management, teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation. The finding indicated that teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation positively predict student achievement, but dimensions of student-oriented instruction and classroom management were negatively related in several countries. Instructional quality was captured by four dimensions in PISA 2022, namely, teacher support, disciplinary climate, cognitive activation in mathematics of encouraging mathematical thinking and of fostering reasoning. Teacher support and disciplinary climate had a positive effect on achievement, but two aspects of cognitive activation had opposite effects on achievement. SES also had significant indirect effects on achievement through various instructional quality dimensions. Across two PISA cycles, teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation consistently benefited low-SES students, while classroom management and student-oriented instruction tended to harm their performance. These results underscore the role of instructional quality in promoting equity for disadvantaged students. Trend data from these two cycles of PISA, give an indication of specific instructional strategies that do consistently contribute to student achievement. Implications and findings are discussed in relation to the policy and practice context in different education systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preservice Mathematics Teachers’ Proportional Reasoning: The Case of Angle Measure Conversions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study explored preservice mathematics teachers’ (PMTs’) use of proportional reasoning given a situation that involves relating degrees to radian angle measure. Five PMTs participated in a semi-structured task-based interview to solve conversion questions from degrees to radians. Thematic analysis of the transcripts showed PMTs using and connecting various proportional reasoning concepts to describe angle measure in radians when given the measure in degrees. The PMTs also justified using memorized facts and calculations for efficiency and practicality. Findings suggest that conversion questions elicit meanings that are attuned to proportional reasoning concepts. I conclude that PMTs’ meanings for the relationship between degrees and radians are complex and not limited to memorization. Mathematics teacher educators can support PMTs by building on proportional reasoning in situations involving conversion between degrees and radians to encourage them to move beyond memorized facts and calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Effects of the 5E Instructional Model: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model—and its related variants—on science, math, and motivation outcomes. The 5E Instructional Model is a framework for delivering STEM instruction that is based on constructivist learning theory; it has been used throughout the U.S. and other countries, particularly in Turkey. Despite its wide usage, no comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of 5E and related models has yet been conducted. Our search and screening procedures yielded 61 randomized controlled trial studies, estimating 156 effect sizes; 70% of studies met WWC standards with or without reservations. We found that the 5E instructional model resulted in improved science outcomes (g = 0.82, 95% CI [0.67, 0.97]), but a large amount of heterogeneity requires some caution (t = 0.56). We explored numerous explanations for the effect heterogeneity and provided practical recommendations.

        <title>Why Do You Want to Be a Teacher? A Natural Language Processing Approach</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Heightened concerns about the health of the teaching profession highlight the importance of studying the early teacher pipeline. This exploratory, descriptive article examines preservice teachers’ expressed motivation for pursuing a teaching career. Using data from a large teacher education program in Texas, we use a natural language processing algorithm to categorize into topical groups roughly 2,800 essay responses to the prompt, “Explain why you decided to become a teacher.” We identify 10 topics that largely reflect altruistic and intrinsic (although not extrinsic) reasons for teaching. The frequency of topics varied substantially by preservice teacher gender, race/ethnicity, and certification area. Intrinsic enjoyment of teaching and experiences with adversity predicted higher clinical teaching performance and lower attrition as a full-time teacher.

        <title>The Relationship Between Course Structure and Intensity, and Student Success in Developmental Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Texas legislation mandated that colleges offer developmental education using a corequisite model, where students concurrently enroll in introductory college-level courses with supplemental developmental support. Using data from the population of Texas students in developmental education, we estimated regression models to investigate differential relationships between corequisite characteristics and outcomes, both overall and by student characteristics. Our findings suggest there is no single “magic bullet” course structure that is universally more effective, as relationships between the reform and student success vary by subject and student subgroup. Additionally, even a single credit of corequisite developmental support can be beneficial for some students, potentially more so than traditional three-credit courses.

        <title>Not “Citizens in Waiting”: Student Counter-Narratives of Anti-Equity Campaigns</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Recent efforts prohibiting race-related diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have informed localized public pushback narrating anti-equity campaigns. Emerging research and media accounts have largely focused on adults engaged with or against these efforts, with less attention on youth and their perceptions of these campaigns. To center youth voice, we analyzed 224 student newspaper articles published in Carmel, Indiana and Loudoun County, Virginia—two sites replete with localized contestations of equity reform. Using narrative policy analysis and approaches to counter-narratives, findings demonstrate youths’ roles as engaged policy actors as student journalists highlighted forms of political engagement and action in their local contexts. We include recommendations for school leaders and policymakers to promote youth voice and engagement in education governance.

        <title>Contribution to didactic research on the completeness/incompleteness of ordered fields of numbers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Understanding the concept of completeness for an ordered field is known to be difficult for many university mathematics students. We hypothesise that the variety of possible axioms of completeness for the set of real numbers is one of the sources of difficulties as is the lack of understanding of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;raison d’être&lt;/em&gt; of these axioms. In this paper, we address this issue by first recalling the discussions on the first proof of the intermediate value theorem by Cauchy (Cours ď analyse De L&#39;École Royale Polytechnique, Part 1: Analyse Algébrique. Debure Frères, 1821) as a contribution to the understanding of the role of completeness in real analysis. Then, we discuss a few research papers that involve the intermediate value theorem and put them in perspective with our own approach. In the second part of the paper, we briefly recall Bolzano’s dissection method and then analyse four proofs of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem for both the set and the sequence versions of the theorem. We then draw on this study to present and motivate the main features of a forthcoming multi-proofs activity that aims to expose students to a small number of axioms of the completeness property and the use of these axioms in proof and proving.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mathematics teacher educators’ documents, praxeologies, and beliefs: a holistic model</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The research presented in this paper aims to shed light on the complex role of mathematics teacher educators who led courses for prospective mathematics teachers. Theoretically, the research combines the documentational approach to didactics and the meta-didactical transposition frameworks, complementing the study with the analysis of the teacher educators’ beliefs about the prospective teachers’ needs. The methodology entails a comparative case study related to two courses, taking place in quite different contexts, led by the two authors independently, and a collaborative self-study of teacher education approach, based on eight reciprocal semi-structured interviews between the authors. The result is a holistic model of mathematics teacher educators’ work that takes into account their practices, including the design of teaching materials based on a variety of resources, justifying discourses and personal beliefs. This can deepen our insight into the expertise of mathematics teacher educators and, prospectively, can be fruitful for their professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do We Know About the Extent of Teacher Shortages Nationwide? A Systematic Examination of Reports of U.S. Teacher Shortages</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Teachers are critical to student learning, but adequately staffing classrooms has been challenging in many parts of the country. Though teacher shortages are widely reported, they are poorly understood, particularly in terms of the magnitude and variation of the shortages, and reported figures are often localized and anecdotal. To address this gap, we systematically examine news reports, Department of Education data, and publicly available information on teacher shortages for every U.S. state. We characterize the data landscape and find there are at least 39,700 vacant positions along with at least 288,000 positions being held by underqualified teachers, both of which are conservative estimates of the extent of teacher shortages nationally. We discuss the implications of our findings for improving data systems, including more specific and consistent reporting of shortage, as well as implications for teacher preparation and education policy.

        <title>Career and Technical Education Alignment Across Five States</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;We describe alignment between high school career and technical education (CTE) and local labor markets across five states—Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Tennessee, and Washington. We find that CTE is partially aligned with local labor markets. A 10-percentage-point higher share of local jobs related to a CTE career cluster is associated with a 3-point higher rate of CTE concentration in that cluster. Women and students from racial or ethnic minority groups are better aligned with local employment than men, in part due to their selection of CTE fields like Education &amp;amp; Training, Health Science, and Hospitality &amp;amp; Tourism, which correspond with a large portion of the workforce in almost every metro area. We find more limited evidence of dynamic, short-term adjustments in CTE after changes in local labor markets. A small degree of realignment lags the labor market by 2 to 3 years and is only observed following changes in college-level employment.

        <title>The Effects of Wisconsin’s Universal Prekindergarten Program on Third-Grade Academic Achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many states and communities have invested in public early childhood education programs to improve children’s readiness to enter school and narrow achievement gaps in later grades. This study asked whether and how Wisconsin’s universal state-funded prekindergarten program, Wisconsin 4K, has improved student achievement and helped to reduce the achievement gap. Using publicly available data from 2002–2003 to 2013–2014, the study examined the effects of the program, which features high participation rates and part-day delivery modes. The results showed that Wisconsin 4K enhanced third-grade reading achievement but not math achievement in the participating districts. Its effects were larger for non-White and economically disadvantaged students than for their White and affluent counterparts. The policy implications for large-scale universal pre-K are discussed.

        <title>The Role of School Context in Explaining Racial Disproportionality in Special Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Research on racial disproportionality in special education has exploded, in part due to federal accountability related to over- or under representation of specific racial groups. Some recent research shifts the focus from the role of student characteristics in predicting special education classification to inquire whether school context moderates. We significantly extend this emerging literature using 8 years of elementary student-and school-level data from New York City public schools, examining more school contextual moderators, expanding racial categories, and distinguishing between cross-sectional and over-time differences. We find many more moderators than previous research identified, and these school context factors appear to be particularly salient for the classification of Black students. Results may inform future consideration by federal policymakers regarding assessment of disproportionality.

        <title>Mathematics teachers’ intention to participate in an online community: an investigation using the Theory of Planned Behaviour</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate mathematics teachers’ beliefs regarding their intention to collaborate regularly in an online community. The central premise is that initiating such a community necessitates an implementation strategy informed by a better understanding of underlying beliefs influencing teachers’ participation intention. Accordingly, this research examines the intention of Australian mathematics teachers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 430) to engage in an online community proposed by their peak state-based professional association. Central to this study, participants’ intentions to engage in regular collaboration predominantly ranged from ‘somewhat disagree’ to ‘agree’, with the average rating approaching ‘somewhat agree’, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to increase this intention. A prominent finding was that participants’ attitudes towards regular collaboration were the strongest predictor of their intention to participate. While participants felt somewhat in control of their collaboration behaviour, this perception did not directly influence their intention; instead, it mediated the influence of subjective approval from others and personal attitudes on their intention. Demographic factors and past online community experiences had far less impact on predicting intentions than the Theory of Planned Behaviour beliefs. Notably, the subjective norm related to perceived approval from others was rated the highest, whereas the norm related to others’ actual behaviour received the lowest ratings, reflecting a significant divergence in the perception of social approval versus actual behaviour. These findings culminate in implications for interventions and extend the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, enhancing knowledge about factors impacting teachers’ engagement in online communities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The professional practice of designing tasks: how do pre-service early childhood teachers promote mathematical processes in early algebra?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spanish educational curriculum adopts a mathematical process-based approach, which encompasses problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections and representation. A fundamental role in the integration of these processes in mathematics teaching is played by teachers’ professional practice of designing tasks. According to this, our aim is to analyze the ways in which pre-service early childhood teachers understand the mathematical processes in the professional practice of designing early algebra tasks and to identify how they intend to promote these processes through the tasks. Content analysis techniques were used to examine the designed tasks. To illustrate the data analysis and results, six tasks are presented. As a result, pre-service early childhood teachers associate problem solving with challenges and questions. They understand problems as unfamiliar situations but ignore the relationships between students and tasks. Moreover, they do not encourage exploration of phases of problem solving and tend to use strategies more suitable for routine tasks. Communication is identified in all the tasks designed, encouraging interaction and discussion. However, only one task explicitly promotes mathematical language. For reasoning and proof, pre-service teachers begin to use questions to elicit explanations and justifications, but do not encourage verification strategies and various modes of reasoning. The process of connections is only present in one task, reflecting the fragmented nature of mathematics teaching. We conclude that the professional practice of designing mathematical tasks is a powerful in teacher education. However, training programs should place greater emphasis on the meaningful use of mathematical processes.&lt;/p&gt;
