        <title>On the Interplay of Motivational Characteristics and Academic Achievement: The Role of Need for Cognition</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;While intelligence and motivational variables are well-established predictors of academic achievement, Need for Cognition (NFC), the stable intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy challenging intellectual activity, has not yet been considered comprehensively in this field, especially not longitudinally. By applying latent change score modeling, we examined the incremental value of NFC, considering well-established motivational constructs and prior achievement in the prediction of academic achievement across different subjects in a longitudinal approach across two time points in a sample of secondary school students ([math] = 271, [math] = 255). Correlations of NFC with grades were comparable to those of established predictors. NFC incrementally predicted academic achievement over and above prior achievement and ability self-concept. A mutual influence of NFC and academic achievement was found pointing to skill development as well as self-enhancement processes taking place in this interplay. Consequently, we propose to include NFC in models for the comprehensive explanation of academic achievement in school.

        <title>Robots’ Social Behaviors for Language Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although robots’ social behaviors are known for their capacity to facilitate learner–robot interaction for language learning, their application and effect have not been adequately explored. This study reviewed 59 empirical articles to examine the contexts and application of various social behaviors of robots for language learning, and conducted a meta-analysis of 18 study samples to evaluate the effect of robots’ social supportive behaviors on language learning achievement. Results indicate that robots’ social behaviors have mostly been applied in the studies with K–12 students, for learning vocabulary in English, including small sample sizes of below 80 participants, and lasting for one session. Second, various verbal and non-verbal behaviors of robots have been identified and applied, showing mixed results on language learning achievement. Third, robots’ social supportive behaviors have produced a positive effect on language learning achievement compared to neutral behaviors (g = 0.269). Finally, detailed suggestions for future research are discussed.

        <title>Multidimensional Framing of Environments Beyond Blocks and Texts in K–12 Programming</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K–12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners’ cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators’ choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments’ suitability and alignment with learning objectives.

        <title>Empirical Analysis of Energy Consumption and Economic Growth in Post-Soviet Eurasia: Do They Matter for Foreign Policy?</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study aims to evaluate the relationship between renewable and non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth in post-Soviet Eurasian countries by employing panel data from 15 countries from 1996 to 2018. The results reveal that the contribution of renewable energy consumption (REC) to economic growth is greater than non-renewable energy consumption. The overall findings imply that the transformation of energy consumption from non-renewable to renewable offers environmental advantages and growth opportunities. Furthermore, the transition to renewables may also expand the range of foreign relations policy options available for these countries, which, in turn, might contribute to a better alignment with evolving global regimes. Transition demands towards the long-term sustainability of global energy sources put pressure on countries to expand their domestic policy efforts and join international cooperation efforts. Therefore, post-Soviet Eurasian countries should develop strategic policy mechanisms and reforms designed to accelerate investments in renewable energy technologies.

        <title>Are Law Schools Cream-Skimming to Bolster Their Bar Exam Pass Rates? A Multilevel Regression Approach to Estimate How Attrition and Transfer Rates Affect Bar Passage</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Law schools are held accountable on many fronts to achieve and maintain high bar passage rates. While the course of legal education itself, along with various interventions, is a key driver of bar exam performance, Bahadur et al. (2021) suggests that obscure institutional practices might be inflating institutional bar passage performance. Such practices could include recruitment and admission of transfer students and academic attrition. We examine this hypothesis to assess the influence of both attrition and transfer on law schools’ bar passage differential using fixed-effects and between-within models. We also utilize Poisson regression to explore the effect of geographical proximity to other law schools on transfer rates. We find that, on average, neither attrition nor transfer activity substantively affect bar passage performance, and that although geographic proximity to other schools is related to transfer rates, this relationship does not result in notable differences in bar passage.

        <title>A Sociological Analysis of Structural Racism in “Student List” Lead Generation Products</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Colleges identify prospective students by purchasing “student lists.” Student list products are selection devices that use search filters to select students. Drawing from the sociology of race, we conceptualize some filters as “racialized inputs,” defined as inputs that are correlated with race because disadvantaged racial groups have historically been excluded from the input. Using a national sample of high school students, we explore the relationship between racialized search filters and the racial composition of included versus excluded students. Using data about actual lists purchased by public universities, we investigate how college administrators utilize racialized search filters. We discuss implications for federal and state policy. We motivate policy research about structural racism embedded in selection devices that allocate students to opportunities.

        <title>The Emergence and Escalation of Online Racial Discrimination in Digital Spaces: A Systematic Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;COVID-19 required educators and students to rapidly move to online learning. Simultaneously, while navigating the pandemic in lockdown, citizens were exposed to the brutal murder of George Floyd. The increased exposure to online activity and discrimination generated a hyperawareness of the potential link between the two. Our interest was to examine that linkage as we considered the prevalence and escalation of online racial discrimination (ORD) as a student phenomenon. Filtering for adolescent and young adult students, this systematic review ultimately employed 21 articles. Our results reflect that ORD as defined, changed over time, as did the ways it manifested. Importantly, the impacts of ORD on student learning and well-being were revealed. This review further indicates that the expansion of online instruction created a complex intersection between online social interactions and academic outcomes ripe for vigilance. Our work adds to the ORD literature while informing future education researchers, educators, and stakeholders of its harmful impacts.

        <title>Measuring the Interdisciplinarity and Collaboration Perceptions of U.S. Scientists, Engineers, and Educators</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinarity has the potential to lead to more innovation and advances in knowledge than are possible from a single discipline. Yet, little is known about interdisciplinary collaborations and the perceptions of those involved. This quantitative study investigated the perceptions of U.S. faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students involved in education and science/engineering collaborations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for two modified scales, Collaboration Perceptions (CP; n = 117; 17 items; α = .923) and Interdisciplinarity Perceptions (IP; n = 119; 11 items; α = .852). Participants’ perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity were strongly positive and did not significantly differ based on demographic factors (e.g., gender, discipline, role). Perceptions were influenced by collectivist orientation; the high collectivism group had significantly more positive perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and collectivist orientation was positively and significantly correlated with CP and IP scores. Implications and recommendations for interdisciplinary collaborations will be discussed.

        <title>Differential effects of private tutoring on groups of students’ mathematics achievements: a longitudinal study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Supplementary private tutoring (PT) is commonly implemented worldwide, particularly among countries with highly competitive school systems and high-stakes examinations. Families often consider PT to promote their children’s skills and address any gaps in children’s learning. However, PT generally requires a considerable amount of family resources, and whether PT effectively increases students’ academic achievement remains subject of debate. This study examined student-report questionnaires and school reports of mathematics achievement from approximately 1500 secondary school students in China to track retrospective longitudinal variations of PT over a year. The study involved an analysis of the differential effectiveness of regular mathematics PT participation on the mathematics achievement of students from different quantiles at four hierarchical cognitive levels. The results indicated that only the lower-quantile students benefited from PT for their lower cognitive level achievement. Further, it was observed that among the higher-quantile students there was a reduction in high cognitive level achievement. These results raise questions concerning the role and effectiveness of PT. This study provides an evidence-based assessment of the effectiveness of PT and highlights the implications for educational practice and future research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Effects and Local Implementation of School Finance Reforms on Teacher Salary, Hiring, and Turnover</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Knowing how policy-induced salary schedule changes affect teacher recruitment and retention will significantly advance our understanding of how resources matter for K–12 student learning. This study sheds light on this issue by estimating how legislative funding changes in Washington state in 2018–2019—induced by the McCleary court-ordered reform—affected teacher salaries and labor market outcomes. By embedding a simulated instrumental variables approach in a mixed-methods design, we observed that local collective bargaining negotiations directed new state funding allocations to substantially increase certificated base salaries, particularly for senior teachers with 16 years or more of teaching experience. Variability in political power, priorities, and interests of both districts and unions led to greater heterogeneity in teacher salary schedules. Suggestive evidence shows that state average teacher turnover rate was significantly reduced in the first year of reform. The McCleary-induced salary increase particularly reduces mid-career teachers’ (8–15 years of teaching experience) mobility rate and late-career teachers’ (23+ years of teaching experience) leaving rate. The McCleary-induced base salary increase has mostly null effects on teacher hiring in the first 2 years of implementation.
