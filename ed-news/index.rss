        <title>Testing a Holistic Framework of Early Care and Education and K–12 Leaders’ Working Conditions and Well-Being</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The importance of leadership for key educational outcomes is well documented, yet leaders’ working conditions and well-being have received considerably less attention, particularly in the early care and education (ECE) sector. Job-Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory was used to develop a holistic conceptualization of leader well-being for the purpose of examining the associations among various job demands, resources, and well-being (i.e., physical, psychological, and professional well-being) for leaders of birth to 12th grade (B–12). We tested our conceptual model via structural equation modeling (SEM) with over 2,000 ECE and K–12 building leaders across the United States. We found substantially stronger effects between job demands and well-being relative to job resources and well-being, though resources were found to be directly associated with professional well-being. Further, our tested model was similar for both ECE and K–12 leaders. Overall findings suggest that a reduction in demands—not just increased resources—is needed to ensure improved leader well-being.

        <title>Poststructural Analysis of Anti-LGBTQ + Educational Policies</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We draw on several critical paradigms, disciplines, and theories to interrogate 13 anti-LGBTQ+ educational policy texts. Using Institutional Theory (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2010; Carpenter &amp;amp; Feroz, 2001) and Poststructural Policy Analysis (Bacchi &amp;amp; Goodwin, 2016), we explore how these texts may cause separations between policy and practice, how they construct “teachers” and “students” as subjects and objects of the state, and how they promote cisheteropatriarchy. The terms reactive evasion and identity evasiveness are presented to describe central discursive mechanisms in the texts. The term identity specificity, or the humanizing practices of recognizing diverse identities, is coined as a fundamental component of educational quality. We situate our work as an enunciation of critical resistance within anti-oppressive discourses and assert three main arguments: (a) these dictates will adversely affect educational institutions; (b) a fundamental component of educational quality is identity specificity; and (c) policy not centered on the humanizing testimony of those about whom that policy is generated reinforces oppressive regimes.

        <title>Shared Responsibility for Multilingual Learners Across Levels of the Education System</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Educational change efforts that prioritize equity for multilingual learners (MLs) require attention to several interconnected components of the education system. We build on prior literature and our collective research to clarify the concept of shared responsibility for ML students and to operationalize the concept at the school, district, and state levels. Drawing on institutional theory and a racialized organizations lens, we argue that shared responsibility is embedded in the mindsets, norms, and structures that shape education systems. We also attend to the complexities of fostering shared responsibility in practice, such as grappling with pervasive educator burnout and developing innovative strategies that span levels of the system. We conclude with directions for future research, including studies examining effective approaches for shifting the mindsets, norms, and routines comprising shared responsibility, and recommendations for researchers to play a more active role in shaping shared responsibility for ML students.

        <title>Leveraging a University to Create Local Equity-Oriented K–12 Learning Opportunities: A Conversation Starter</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article shares our university center’s efforts to act as a boundary spanner supporting colleagues across our university to contribute collectively to more equitable educational opportunities for local K–12 students and their teachers. We focus here on the ongoing critical reflection and collaboration needed to tap such university resources to support K–12 students typically underresourced and underserved in K–12 systems. We consider examples and challenges of our work through five equity-oriented principles. We seek to highlight the role of research-practice teams on campuses that help (or could help) university partners contribute to local K–12 schools, programs, and systems with equity in mind. Finally, we hope to convince other higher education institutions to leverage their resources more to grow K–12 education opportunities locally where needs are greatest.

        <title>Are Changes in Reported Social-Emotional Skills Just Noise? The Predictive Power of Longitudinal Differences in Self-Reports</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Prior work has shown that students’ self-reported levels on social-emotional measures predict achievement levels and gains, but we have little evidence on whether within-student changes in self-reports on social-emotional surveys are predictive of changes in theoretically related academic and behavioral outcomes. We use large-scale data from the California CORE districts to examine whether changes in individual reports on social-emotional measures from one school year to the next predict changes in state math and English language arts test scores and attendance. We show that changes in self-reported social-emotional measures predict changes in both achievement and attendance. These results are robust across model specifications. Moreover, the relationships between SEL and achievement and attendance outcomes are consistent across student subgroups.

        <title>Defending the Color Line: White Supremacy and the Legacy of Brown</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Building on W. E. B. Du Bois’s color line concept, I argue that white supremacy is deeply embedded in U.S. educational organizations and that White racial actors, opportunity hoarding, and the cultivation of racial ideology and racial ignorance help sustain it. In doing this, I seek to move away from the aspirational progress narratives often associated with Brown to the racial hierarchies and various forms of harm that schools reproduce, even when they are racially diverse. Taking the recent attacks against critical race theory as a backdrop, I argue that educational institutions not only contribute to educational inequity but also socialize people into relations of racial domination and subordination through organizational practices and individual actions. In the article’s conclusion, I highlight my efforts to disrupt these patterns and work toward the creation of more liberatory education spaces.

        <title>Distinguishing Subtypes of Self-Efficacy Among Secondary School Teachers: A Latent Profile Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teacher self-efficacy is a crucial factor in teaching and learning, yet there is limited understanding of its heterogeneity among the Asian population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (a) identify different self-efficacy patterns among 3,095 Singaporean lower secondary school teachers, (b) investigate potential variations in job satisfaction, constructivist beliefs, and teacher co-operation across different self-efficacy profiles, and (c) examine the predictions of teacher background characteristics in relation to profile membership. By employing latent profile analysis, four distinct self-efficacy profiles were identified: (a) Low Self-Efficacy, (b) Moderate Self-Efficacy, (c) High Self-Efficacy, and (d) Divergent Moderate Self-Efficacy. The results also revealed significant differences in job satisfaction, constructivist beliefs, and teacher co-operation among the self-efficacy profiles. Moreover, teaching experience emerged as a significant predictor of profile membership. These highlight the need for tailored professional development programs and interventions that consider teachers’ self-efficacy profiles, teacher outcomes, and teaching experience.

        <title>Power Analyses for Estimation of Complier Average Causal Effects Under Random Encouragement Designs in Education Research: Theory and Guidance</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Random encouragement designs evaluate treatments that aim to increase participation in a program or activity. These randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can also assess the mediated effects of participation itself on longer term outcomes using a complier average causal effect (CACE) estimation framework. This article considers power analysis methods for such CACE analyses for a range of RCT designs, including nonclustered, clustered, and random block designs. The focus is on behavioral encouragements to promote action, such as text messaging, that are increasingly being tested in education trials. We derive asymptotic distributions of the CACE estimators using generalized estimating equations theory, which underlie the power formulas. We incorporate noncompliance from both the actual receipt of the encouragement and participation itself. An illustrative power analysis provides sample size guidance using an available Shiny R dashboard.

        <title>“So That I May Hope to Honor You”: Centering Wholeness, Agency, and Brilliance in Qualitative Research With Multiply Marginalized Young Children</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Scholars of early childhood education have urged qualitative researchers to adapt their methods for use with young children. However, unjust social imaginations of childhood (e.g., who is considered a “child”) play out in qualitative research, particularly for young children who are made most vulnerable by intersecting oppressions (e.g., racism, linguicism, ableism). Extending Morrison’s metaphor of “the white gaze,” we argue that qualitative research is often framed through an “adult gaze,” which presumes children’s worth in terms of who they will ultimately become and differentially imagines who is considered a child in the present. Informed by theoretical understandings from the fields of critical childhood studies and early literacy studies, we consider how qualitative researchers might disrupt the adult gaze and honor multiply marginalized children by centering their wholeness, orienting toward their agency, and creating space for their brilliance.

        <title>Reckoning With the “Other” Pandemic: How Teachers’ Unions Responded to Calls for Racial Justice Amidst COVID-19</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;After George Floyd was murdered by police, teachers, alongside the leaders of their unions and professional associations, confronted urgent calls to address racism in their communities, schools, and classrooms, just as they were concluding an academic year rendered chaotic by COVID-19. This article leverages four waves of semistructured interviews with teachers’ union and association leaders embedded in 14 states and 45 school districts to investigate how and why teachers’ unions responded to those calls during 2020 and 2021. Local leaders were more likely to have taken concrete steps if they were serving urban or suburban and predominantly Democratic communities. Most commonly, unions offered symbolic gestures of support or sought to develop their capacity to recognize and understand bias.

        <title>Profiles of general, test, and mathematics anxiety in 9- and 12-year-olds: relations to gender and mathematics achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As international focus increasingly turns to the need to build a future mathematics workforce, research has aimed to better understand the salient individual and contextual factors that influence maths engagement and achievement across development. This study investigates self-reported general anxiety, test anxiety, and maths anxiety in two cohorts of Australian students aged 9–10 years (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 158) and 12–13 years (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 115) and associations with maths achievement and gender. Test and maths anxiety were negatively correlated with maths achievement and there were no gender differences in maths achievement. Cross-sectional latent profile analyses established two anxiety profiles in the older cohort (low and high across all anxiety measures) and a more complex five-profile solution for the younger cohort (various combinations of anxiety). Members of profiles with higher levels of test and mathematics anxiety had lower maths achievement, with girls over-represented in these profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Conflation of Dual Language Bilingual Education With Gifted Programs in New York City Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As neighborhoods across New York City gentrify, Dual Language Bilingual Education (DLBE) has become a big draw for gentrifier families. Our research contributes to growing literature on DLBE gentrification by examining how a racially diverse group of parents in two communities perceived DLBE as a school choice option. We found that schools with DLBE programs screened potential students via academic screening tests or school choice processes to determine admission into DLBE programs. This screening process has contributed to a) the conflation of DLBE with the city’s gifted programs, and b) a focus away from admitting and centering emergent bilinguals. While this screening served to further advantage gentrifier families, some parents resisted the opportunity hoarding behaviors of their peers through their alternative school choices and advocacy efforts. In this way, we show how all parents are constrained and impacted by the neoliberal logics of contemporary DLBE policy and school choice.

        <title>Degrees of Return: Estimating Internal Rates of Return for College Majors Using Quantile Regression</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Using data collected from more than 5.8 million high school and college graduates ages 18 to 65 years who participated in the American Community Survey between 2009 and 2021, the authors estimate the internal rates of return (IRRs) for individuals with college degrees in 10 broad majors compared with high school graduates. The analysis shows significant differences in the age-earnings trajectories and IRRs across college majors. Furthermore, quantile regression analyses show that IRR is generally higher at the high end of the earnings distribution compared with the low end. Finally, the authors observed a slight decrease in IRR during the study period, which is consistent with the flattening and even decline in college wage premiums following the 2008 Great Recession.
