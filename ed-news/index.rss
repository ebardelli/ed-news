        <title>An Improved Inferential Procedure to Evaluate Item Discriminations in a Conditional Maximum Likelihood Framework</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A modified and improved inductive inferential approach to evaluate item discriminations in a conditional maximum likelihood and Rasch modeling framework is suggested. The new approach involves the derivation of four hypothesis tests. It implies a linear restriction of the assumed set of probability distributions in the classical approach that represents scenarios of different item discriminations in a straightforward and efficient manner. Its improvement is discussed, compared to classical procedures (tests and information criteria), and illustrated in Monte Carlo experiments as well as real data examples from educational research. The results show an improvement of power of the modified tests of up to 0.3.

        <title>Latent Trait Item Response Models for Continuous Responses</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A general framework of latent trait item response models for continuous responses is given. In contrast to classical test theory (CTT) models, which traditionally distinguish between true scores and error scores, the responses are clearly linked to latent traits. It is shown that CTT models can be derived as special cases, but the model class is much wider. It provides, in particular, appropriate modeling of responses that are restricted in some way, for example, if responses are positive or are restricted to an interval. Restrictions of this sort are easily incorporated in the modeling framework. Restriction to an interval is typically ignored in common models yielding inappropriate models, for example, when modeling Likert-type data. The model also extends common response time models, which can be treated as special cases. The properties of the model class are derived and the role of the total score is investigated, which leads to a modified total score. Several applications illustrate the use of the model including an example, in which covariates that may modify the response are taken into account.

        <title>From Over-Tourism to Under-Tourism via COVID-19: Lessons for Sustainable Tourism Management</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;With various strains of the novel coronavirus emerging during the last few years, there is a need to reinvent and manage the tourism industry by engaging various stakeholders. Industry and policymakers need to observe the shift and curate tourism-related products and offerings accordingly. In light of the increasing demand for innovations and future directions in the post-COVID-19 period, this article conducts a bibliometric analysis for sustainable tourism studies spanning the years 1990–2021. This paper presents an integrative review of tourism, environment and sustainable tourism to reveal geographical, contextual, and methodological directions for future research. The comprehensive analysis includes contributions on topics and methods, country collaborations, and thematic analysis. The findings are consistent with the Sustainable Development Goals of sustainable production and consumption (SDG-12), with a particular emphasis on sustainable tourism to promote local culture and create jobs (SDG-12.b) and on sustainable growth (SDG-13). The study’s findings can be used to inform future policies and directions; for example, the findings indicate that the hospitality industry is facing challenges that necessitate new regulations to address its socioeconomic and environmental impacts.

        <title>Strengthening mathematical orientation: how university mathematics courses can gain relevance for pre-service teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of the article is to discuss how university mathematics courses can become more relevant for pre-service teachers (PSTs). We therefore introduce a concept we call mathematical orientation and develop an analytical framework based on Felix Klein’s pervasive approach to elementary mathematics from a higher standpoint and the work of the practical philosopher Stegmaier on orientation. This framework is used to analyze the mathematical orientation of PSTs on two mathematics courses in Norway and Switzerland. In a qualitative empirical approach, we analyzed 85 reflections written by PSTs on the topic of decimal expansions and reconstructed aspects of their individual mathematical orientation. Our results show that mathematical orientation varies across PSTs to a certain extent. In particular, different points of reference, perspectives, standpoints, and types of links between the mathematical content and teaching situations could be identified. We therefore propose that mathematical orientation can be considered a key variable in addressing the mathematical needs of PSTs in university courses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inquiry-based mathematics education and attitudes towards mathematics: tracking profiles for teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research on the relationships between the main constructs underlying inquiry-based learning is rarely reported in mathematics education research. Considering this as a complex problem which is worth to be investigated, the present study aims to provide some empirical evidences that might serve as an insight to support further investigations on the relationships between attitudes towards mathematics and inquiry-based learning approaches. Thus, this study adopts a descriptive research design where no variables are manipulated but observed and measured in order to identify changes depicted in data collection. An instructional design focusing on the nature of mathematical inquiry is carried out with the participation of 304 secondary and high school students, and a clustering approach is used to look at how participants are grouped around certain attitudinal profiles before and after such mathematical practice. The results show how the heterogeneity of attitudinal profiles present in the classroom evolves positively in terms of perceived usefulness of mathematics and mathematical self-concept as perception of competence in mathematics. This fact provides some basis that might be used for further research on the idea that certain forms of development in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;inquiry-based mathematics education (IBME)&lt;/em&gt; based on greater immersion in the nature and culture of mathematics can help students to improve their attitudes towards mathematics.

        <title>Cream Skimming and Pushout of Students Participating in a Statewide Private School Voucher Program</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A pervasive issue in the school choice literature is whether schools of choice cream skim students by enrolling high-achieving, less-challenging, or less-costly students. Similarly, schools of choice may “push out” low-achieving, more-challenging, or more-costly students. Using longitudinal student-level data from Indiana, we created multiple measures to examine whether there is evidence consistent with the claims of voucher-participating private schools cream skimming the best students from public schools or pushing out voucher-receiving students. We do not find evidence consistent with the claim of cream skimming. However, we find evidence consistent with the claim of private schools pushing out the lowest-achieving voucher students. This is the first study to examine these two issues within a statewide private school voucher program.

        <title>Cultivating Stronger Coaching in Clinical Mentors: An Experimental Evaluation of the Mentors Matter Professional Development Initiative</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Despite the critical role of mentors in the preparation of preservice teachers, very little causal quantitative research has explored the effects of offering mentors professional development (PD) around how to coach and support their candidates. We conduct an experimental evaluation of a PD opportunity randomly offered to mentors within six different Tennessee programs over the course of 3 years to investigate its impacts on the perceptions and practices of both the mentors themselves and their candidates. PD significantly increased the frequency of coaching provided by mentors and mentors’ own instructional effectiveness but did not impact their candidates’ satisfaction or feelings of preparedness, though candidates of mentors assigned to treatment were marginally significantly more likely to find employment.

        <title>From Interest to Entry: The Teacher Pipeline From College Application to Initial Employment</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Strengthening teacher supply is a key policy objective for K–12 public education, but understanding of the early teacher pipeline remains limited. In this descriptive analysis, we leverage the universe of applications to a large public university in Texas from 2009 to 2020 to examine the pipeline into teacher education and employment as a K–12 public school teacher. A unique feature of Texas’s centralized higher education application is that it solicits potential interest in teacher certification. We document sharply declining interest in teaching over the period. Further, we show that students of color, men, and students with higher SAT scores are substantially underrepresented in teacher education. Particularly for race/ethnicity, these disparities are only partially explained by differences in interest at application.

        <title>Undergraduate students’ attitudes towards mathematical proving in an introduction to proof course</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we investigated undergraduate mathematics students’ (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 267) attitudes towards proving. The students were taking an introduction-to-proof type course that was situated at the beginning of the mathematics curriculum and lasted for one term. Four attitude variables were measured at the beginning and at the end of the course with a new self-report instrument: self-efficacy, anxiety, appreciation and motivation. The instrument was based on two existing instruments on mathematics attitudes and proof-related self-efficacy. We studied how these four attitude variables were related to the students’ prior skills and their gender at the beginning of the course, how the attitude variables changed during the course, and how they affected the students’ performance in the final course project. Our results indicate that students’ prior performance is linked to their proof-related self-efficacy, anxiety and motivation at the beginning of the course. Female students exhibited lower efficacy and motivation levels than male students. During the focus course, students’ self-efficacy increased and anxiety decreased. The gender gaps in self-efficacy and motivation persisted throughout the course. In addition, high motivation in the beginning of the course predicted good performance in the final project. Based on our results, we conclude that an introductory course on proving can enhance students’ attitudes, and we suggest that these attitudes are taken into account in teaching as they can affect students’ performance. Finally, we urge researchers and professionals to earnestly consider ways to mitigate gender differences in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Developing Geometric Reasoning of the Relationship of the Cauchy Riemann Equations and Differentiation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates the embodied, symbolic, and formal reasoning of two fourth-year university students while exploring geometric reasoning about the Cauchy-Riemann equations with the aid of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Geometer’s Sketchpad (GSP)&lt;/em&gt;. These students participated in a teaching activity designed to encourage shifts between embodied, symbolic, and formal reasoning of the Cauchy-Riemann equations as they relate to the amplitwist concept. This research extends previous work related to the complex derivative which only makes use of the limit definition. The Cauchy-Riemann equations naturally integrate notions from linear algebra and multi-variable calculus, which have their own embodied and symbolic interpretations and introduce different challenges in developing a geometric/embodied understanding of the C-R equations. Our work also illustrates how conversations expressed through utterances served as a catalyst for teasing out and connecting the symbolic representations such as the Jacobian and partial derivatives inherent in the Cauchy-Riemann equations. As such, taking part in conversations via utterances with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GSP&lt;/em&gt;, inscriptions, and other students can create opportunities for students to connect concepts and recognize contradictions across multiple forms of reasoning. We offer potential anticipatory knowledge for complex analysis instructors to facilitate similarly rich conversations within the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Two-Eyed Seeing Teaching and Learning Framework for Science Education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Worldwide, education jurisdictions are looking for authentic ways to address First Nations perspectives in the K-12 curriculum, including science education. At the same time, there have been ongoing efforts to integrate authentic and engaging approaches to teaching science, including those that are student-centred, inquiry-based, multimodal, and linked to meaningful contexts. Both goals may be realised through the principle of Two-Eyed Seeing (TES), which seeks to integrate the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing with one eye, and Western ways of knowing with the other eye, for the benefit of all students. This theoretical paper presents a Two-Eyed Seeing for Science Education (TESSE) Framework, which brings together two pedagogical models. One is from a contemporary science perspective, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5Es&lt;/em&gt; representation-rich inquiry approach, which scaffolds authentic student-centred conceptually focused learning experiences. The other is from an Indigenous perspective, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;8 Aboriginal Ways of Learning, which&lt;/em&gt; illustrates different ways of knowing—many of which are familiar with First Peoples across the world (e.g., place-based, visual, holistic). The TESSE Framework aims to act as a strengths-based interface between the two knowledge systems to support a culturally responsive approach to teaching and learning science. It is designed to support meaningful connections through curriculum and pedagogy in ways that are contextually relevant to place. Through empirical investigation and in collaboration with local communities, the Framework has the potential to inform current approaches to science education in schools and universities and provide a pathway towards decolonisation and reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teacher Self-Care Mandates as Institutional Gaslighting in a Neoliberal System</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this manuscript, I argue that narratives of self-care for educators in the midst of pandemic teaching are a form of gaslighting, supported and exacerbated by a neoliberal school system that reinforces individualist, White-normed conceptions of teaching and learning. To make this argument, I use several excerpts from practicing teachers’ writing to illustrate the deep sense of frustration and betrayal that teachers felt when inundated with self-care messages without regard for more systemic support and change.

        <title>Constructivist and Transmissive Mentoring: Effects on Teacher Self-Efficacy, Emotional Management, and the Role of Novices’ Initial Beliefs</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Mentoring is acknowledged as an essential prerequisite for successful teacher induction, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the mentor’s quality of support and the mentee’s initial professional beliefs. Focusing on novice teachers’ self-efficacy and emotional management, this longitudinal study investigates how constructivist- and transmission-oriented mentoring approaches support beginning teachers’ professional development, and how these approaches interact with the novices’ initial beliefs about teaching and learning. The data stem from a sample of 138 beginning teachers who participated in an online survey during their second and third trimesters of practical training in Germany. Moderated regression analyses indicate positive effects of constructivist mentoring on teacher self-efficacy 6 months later, and an enhancing moderation effect of mentees’ mismatching, transmissive beliefs. Results neither support distinct effects of constructivist mentoring on novices’ emotional management nor associations between transmissive mentoring and the outcomes. Implications for mentoring research and practice are discussed.

        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We provide novel evidence on the broader impacts of school choice systems by quantifying disparities in peer continuity from middle to high school in New York City. We find that Black and Hispanic students and those in high-poverty neighborhoods attend high school with a much smaller fraction of their middle school or neighborhood peers than their White, Asian, and low-poverty neighborhood counterparts. Disparities also emerge in peer isolation: 27% and 20% of Black and Hispanic students transitioned with no other student from their middle school, while only 7% to 8% of White and Asian students did. Group differences in choice similarity, which in part reflects systematic variation in the number of local school options, drive this result.

        <title>A Multidimensional Partially Compensatory Response Time Model on Basis of the Log-Normal Distribution</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the existing multidimensional extensions of the log-normal response time (LNRT) model, the log response times are decomposed into a linear combination of several latent traits. These models are fully compensatory as low levels on traits can be counterbalanced by high levels on other traits. We propose an alternative multidimensional extension of the LNRT model by assuming that the response times can be decomposed into two response time components. Each response time component is generated by a one-dimensional LNRT model with a different latent trait. As the response time components—but not the traits—are related additively, the model is partially compensatory. In a simulation study, we investigate the recovery of the model’s parameters. We also investigate whether the fully and the partially compensatory LNRT model can be distinguished empirically. Findings suggest that parameter recovery is good and that the two models can be distinctly identified under certain conditions. The utility of the model in practice is demonstrated with an empirical application. In the empirical application, the partially compensatory model fits better than the fully compensatory model.

        <title>“They Asked for More, More, and More Paperwork”: Administrative Burdens When Undocumented Youth Claim In-State Resident Tuition Policy Benefits</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Undocumented immigrants face learning, compliance, and psychological costs when confronting in-state resident tuition (ISRT) policy implementation. Building on administrative burdens scholarship and using qualitative data from 19 semi-structured interviews with undocumented youth immigrants, this article examines administrative burdens that may discourage and prevent students from accessing ISRT policy—a public benefit aimed at extending their educational opportunities. Findings demonstrate that undocumented youth navigate multifaceted contexts, including multiple rules at different organizational levels and interactions with admissions officers whose attitudes may facilitate or obstruct access. This study spotlights how some intended beneficiaries may be more affected by stigma and fear, depriving them of accessing public benefits. Furthermore, the study shows how bureaucratic procedures reinforce existing social inequalities by affecting those less well-positioned to address burdens.
