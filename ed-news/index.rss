        <title>Real and illusionary difficulties in conceptual learning in mathematics: comparison between constructivist and inferentialist perspectives</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Due to the learning paradox, students cannot have real difficulty in understanding a mathematical concept that they have not yet understood. There is a gap between real difficulties, directly experienced by students, and illusionary ones, only observed by researchers. This paper aims to offer a critical reflection on our understanding of the term &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;difficulty&lt;/em&gt; in mathematics education research. We start this paper by arguing that a constructivist perspective, which has often been adopted in researches on mathematical task design, can deal with difficulties in solving a mathematical problem, but it cannot theoretically deal with those in understanding a mathematical concept. Therefore, we need the alternative philosophy of Robert Brandom’s inferentialism to capture students’ real difficulties in conceptual learning. From an inferentialist perspective, we introduce the idea of illusionary and real difficulties. The former is defined as what students cannot do, but they are not conscious of what they should do, while the latter is defined as what students cannot do despite their consciousness of what they should do. Through an eighth grade classroom episode, we argue that it is important in mathematics education research to focus not only on illusionary difficulties but also on the transition from illusionary to real difficulties. Researchers are encouraged to design a learning environment in which students become conscious of what they cannot do and to observe their mathematics learning in such an environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>State Postsecondary Boards as Policy Influencers During the Early Stages of COVID-19</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In an era where many states’ postsecondary education governance dynamics are evolving, we set out to understand whether state-level governing boards with centralized governance functions affected institutions’ decisions to engage in in-person instruction during the fall of 2020, the first fall of the Covid-19 pandemic. We examined sociopolitical features related to the strength of governance functions of centralized state boards. The data alluded to linkages between Republican control and lower bachelor’s degree attainment linking (β = −.45) with weaker centralized governance. We also found a negative effect from increased centralized governance functions (β = −.12) to in-person instruction at public 4-year institutions for fall 2020. This paper gives a real-time opportunity to see if the characteristics of governing boards influence return to campus.

        <title>Utilising personas as a methodological approach to support prospective mathematics teachers’ adaptation and development of digital mathematics learning resources</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Personas, initially originated in user experience research, are short and simplified representations of particular user groups, and this methodological approach has recently gained ground in educational research. This study aims to explore aspects of personas that may be beneficial for prospective mathematics teachers when they develop digital learning resources. To explore such aspects, we employed qualitative interviews, thinking-out-loud techniques, and jointly developed learning resources with prospective mathematics teachers, and analysed this diverse data with a combination of case study and grounded theory approaches. Consequently, we were able to identify the following essential aspects of using personas in our study: (A) personas as representatives of real people, (B) personas as planning &amp;amp; feedback tools for material development, (C) professionalisation of prospective mathematics teachers (by using personas), (D) differentiation/individualisation for personas through digital learning resources, and (E) motivational elements of digital mathematics learning resources. Based on our results, we concluded that using personas could broaden prospective mathematics teachers’ views on student characteristics and demands that may enable teachers to facilitate the development of differentiated and individualised digital mathematics learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Study Program Leaders’ Perceptions of Coherence and Strategies for Creating Coherent Teacher Education Programs</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Scholars and policymakers have consistently argued for the importance of coherence in teacher education (TE). Despite this attention to coherence, challenges of fragmentation and disconnect remain, and little research exists on how study program leaders (SPLs) in TE work to achieve coherence. This article explores how SPLs in two selected TE institutions in Norway perceive coherence and what strategies they use to create coherent TE programs. The two case studies use an ethnographic approach and report on repeated qualitative interviews with seven SPLs, supported by short-term observations over a period of one academic year. The analysis contributes to the small but emergent literature on how SPLs conceptualize coherence and identifies six strategies that SPLs use to navigate persistent barriers within a diverse and autonomous faculty in their ongoing efforts to strengthen coherence in TE programs. Implications for study program leadership in TE are discussed.

        <title>Noncognitive Factors and Student Long-Run Success: Comparing the Predictive Validity of Observable Academic Behaviors and Social-Emotional Skills</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Noncognitive constructs such as self-efficacy, social awareness, and academic engagement are widely acknowledged as critical components of human capital, but systematic data collection on such skills in school systems is complicated by conceptual ambiguities, measurement challenges and resource constraints. This study addresses this issue by comparing the predictive validity of two most widely used metrics on noncogntive outcomes—observable academic behaviors (e.g., absenteeism, suspensions) and student self-reported social and emotional learning (SEL) skills—for the likelihood of high school graduation and postsecondary attainment. Our findings suggest that conditional on student demographics and achievement, academic behaviors are several-fold more predictive than SEL skills for all long-run outcomes, and adding SEL skills to a model with academic behaviors improves the model’s predictive power minimally. In addition, academic behaviors are particularly strong predictors for low-achieving students’ long-run outcomes. Part-day absenteeism (as a result of class skipping) is the largest driver behind the strong predictive power of academic behaviors. Developing more nuanced behavioral measures in existing administrative data systems might be a fruitful strategy for schools whose intended goal centers on predicting students’ educational attainment.

        <title>Politics, Covid, and In-Person Instruction During the First Year of the Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In spring 2020, nearly every U.S. public school closed at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Existing evidence suggests that local political partisanship was a better predictor of in-person instruction than Covid case and death rates in fall 2020. We replicate and extend these analyses using data collected over the entirety of the 2020–21 academic year. We affirm that local political partisanship was an important initial predictor of county-level in-person instruction rates. We also demonstrate that, under certain conditions, Covid case and death rates were meaningfully associated with initial rates of in-person instruction. We reveal that partisanship became less predictive—and prior average student achievement became more predictive—of in-person instruction as the school year continued. We then leverage data from two nationally representative surveys of Americans’ attitudes toward education and identify an as-yet-undiscussed factor that predicts in-person instruction: public support for increasing teachers’ salaries.

        <title>Effects of Study Load on Science Achievement: Searching for a Turning Point with Multilevel Piecewise Regression</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;With an educational issue that has caught the attention of many countries in the world (study load), a population of 8th graders from a typical Chinese metropolitan city (40,536 from 118 schools), and an advanced statistical strategy (multilevel piecewise regression), we examined whether there was a turning point in terms of the effects of study load on science achievement. We did identify a turning point for each and every measure of study load. For weekday learning on science achievement, we identified a turning point of 22.50 hr for the effects of in-school learning, 7.50 hr for the effects of homework, and 12 hr for the effects of after-school learning. For weekend learning on science achievement, we identified a turning point of 1.50 hr for the effects of in-school learning, 5 hr for the effects of homework, and 1 hr for the effects of after-school learning. In each case, the difference in effects before and after the turning point was statistically significant, indicating that the effects of study load on science achievement were nonlinear. All of these turning points offered important implications for science education.

        <title>Retention and Educational Inequalities in the U.S.</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many U.S. schools utilize grade retention (repeating grades when not meeting academic benchmarks) to allow more time for students to learn grade level material. However, some research suggests retention may increase inequalities and not help students progress. We use national data (Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study 2014–2017) and logistic regression to examine what predicts the likelihood of elementary school retention and whether retention is associated with long term outcomes. We find that race and family income did not predict who was most likely to be retained. As expected, boys were more likely to be retained than girls. Most importantly, we show that, of students in major metropolitan areas, retention did not predict long-term academic outcomes (regardless of race, sex, or familial income). Retention did predict long-term exclusionary discipline outcomes for Black students only supporting the School to Prison Pipeline framework.

        <title>A Bibliometric Review of Ethical Leadership Research: Shifting Focuses and Theoretical Insights</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This study used bibliographic data from Web of Science and employed various bibliometric analysis tools to present a systematic review of ethical leadership research from a board perspective. Theoretical evolutions underpinning how ethical leaders influence their followers are also detailed. Results identify the key documents, frequent keywords, and the most used theories in the field of ethical leadership. Results show that not only are there few newcomers to the field, the knowledge on ethical leadership, dominated by a minority few, has not diffused to a broader community. Results also show that although the focus of ethical leadership research in recent years shifted to employee creativity and knowledge sharing, the theories applied in the investigations remain the dominant social exchange theory and social learning theory. The results provide useful references for future studies, avoiding repetitive research while identifying possible knowledge gaps.

        <title>Combining Human and Automated Scoring Methods in Experimental Assessments of Writing: A Case Study Tutorial</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In a randomized trial that collects text as an outcome, traditional approaches for assessing treatment impact require that each document first be manually coded for constructs of interest by human raters. An impact analysis can then be conducted to compare treatment and control groups, using the hand-coded scores as a measured outcome. This process is both time and labor-intensive, which creates a persistent barrier for large-scale assessments of text. Furthermore, enriching one’s understanding of a found impact on text outcomes via secondary analyses can be difficult without additional scoring efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide a pipeline for using machine-based text analytic and data mining tools to augment traditional text-based impact analysis by analyzing impacts across an array of automatically generated text features. In this way, we can explore what an overall impact signifies in terms of how the text has evolved due to treatment. Through a case study based on a recent field trial in education, we show that machine learning can indeed enrich experimental evaluations of text by providing a more comprehensive and fine-grained picture of the mechanisms that lead to stronger argumentative writing in a first- and second-grade content literacy intervention. Relying exclusively on human scoring, by contrast, is a lost opportunity. Overall, the workflow and analytical strategy we describe can serve as a template for researchers interested in performing their own experimental evaluations of text.

        <title>Teaching for statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education: a systematic review on teacher variables, teacher education, and impacts on classroom practice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Statistical and data literacy have emerged as key competencies in the 21st-century. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula have been adapted in various countries to place increased emphasis on proficient data use and statistical comprehension. Consequently, there is a need for an adequate education and professional training of STEM teachers. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes research on teachers’ statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education. A total of 42 articles were analyzed, with a specific focus on teacher variables, teacher education, and their impact on classroom practice. The findings emphasize the recent emergence of research in this domain, particularly focusing on statistical literacy, with mathematics being the dominant STEM domain explored. Most studies examined cognitive variables of both pre-service and in-service teachers, revealing relevant gaps in knowledge and skills related to statistical and data literacy. Limited attention was given to teachers’ affective variables. Research on the complex relationships between teacher variables, their teaching practices, and their students’ learning is scarce, necessitating further investigation. Several pedagogical approaches to prepare STEM teachers for promoting statistical and data literacy in their classrooms were identified. Positive impacts on teachers’ cognitive and affective variables were observed, but longitudinal effects and transfer to classroom practice require further inquiry. As curricula worldwide increasingly emphasize statistical and data literacy, this review underscores the necessity of enhancing teachers&#39; competencies, advocates for tailored pedagogical approaches, and emphasizes the need for further research to shape effective instruction in K-12 STEM education.&lt;/p&gt;
