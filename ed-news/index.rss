        <title>What do adults know about public education?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-14, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Adults’ beliefs and knowledge about the state of the U.S. education system drive decisions about policy, funding, program adoption, student participation in programs, and the selection of decision makers to elected positions. Amie Rapaport and Anna Rosefsky Saavedra share national survey data showing that U.S. adults have little knowledge about what is being taught in schools, express neutrality about belief systems undergirding education policy, and report experiences misaligned with hard-data trends on student academic progress in recent years. With adults reporting they learn about issues crucial to our education system mainly from “personal experience,” better information has the potential to improve U.S. education.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Pandemic recovery will depend on political rediscovery</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-53, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The current culture wars have been showing up in schools and districts, making local school board races increasingly partisan. The 2024 presidential race is placing even more attention on the partisan divide in local education policies and decisions. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins writes that education advocates can leverage this focus and help put aside partisan politics and meet the post-pandemic challenges students face.

        <title>Under the Law: Title IX and the SCOTUS power grab</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;New Title IX regulations issued by the Department of Education expand the types of sexual harassment schools must address and give schools greater flexibility in how they handle hearings. But the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo expands courts’ roles in how federal agencies interpret and enforce regulations like Title IX. Robert Kim considers how the Loper Bright ruling might affect Title IX.

        <title>Poll Points: Education and the election</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-64, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Looking to the election in November, 54% of Americans say public education will be extremely or very important to their vote; 44% say it’ll be somewhat or not at all important. Among public school parents, more, 70%, say education will be important in their vote for president.

        <title>Making mathematics visible through narrative</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 38-43, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The latest content and practice standards for mathematics have promoted the use of academic language and discourse in this content area. As such, the WIDA Consortium has evolved its guidelines to deepen teachers’ conceptual understanding of language in their content areas, and thus, enable them to provide more effective instruction to multilingual learners. Karen L. Terrell explores one of the primary “key language uses” in mathematics — the narrative genre. She also considers how visuals can be powerful scaffolds and means of expression for multilingual learners and discusses how visuals can be used for students to both receive and express knowledge. The use of narrative and visuals can make mathematics more accessible to all students.

        <title>First Person: Sticker politics</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-51, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;On Lucía van Ryzin’s first day as a student teacher, she was given a sheet of stickers and told to give a sticker to each student who was seated, silent, and had a notebook out. As she walked around the room, she noticed that some students were more focused on getting the sticker than on thinking about their assignment. She uses the experience to weigh the value of extrinsic motivators like stickers for motivating student learning.

        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 56-58, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Competition-based efforts to improve student achievement have not borne fruit. Marion Brady argues that this is because such efforts do not address the problems with the current system of education, in which human knowledge is broken up into separate disciplines. He advocates a systems-based approach that focuses on how ideas and experiences relate to one another.

        <title>Federal focus on education initiatives wins broad public support Findings from the 56th annual PDK Poll</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-30, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Preparing students to enter the workforce and attracting and retaining good teachers are Americans’ top educational priorities for the next administration in Washington, regardless of who wins the upcoming presidential election, the 2024 PDK Poll finds. While eight in 10 or more Americans pick those two items as priorities, other policy priorities also win broad support. Seven in 10 — or more — favor an increased focus on addressing student mental health, helping students who have fallen behind academically, and college affordability. The survey was produced by Langer Research Associates for PDK International, with data collected June 21 to July 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a representative, random national sample of 1,009 adults.

        <title>Creating a space for regulation and reflection</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 44-48, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In response to the growing awareness of trauma and its impact on student learning, schools across the country are implementing trauma-sensitive practices. Authors Maia Cucchiara and Mary Beth Hays describe an approach to trauma sensitivity in schools: the creation of restoration rooms, spaces designed to help students (and adults) return to a state of regulation. Restoration rooms are not for disciplining students. Instead, they are spaces equipped with fidget toys, soft carpets and cushions, flexible seating, and other materials to promote regulation. Schools can use these spaces as part of larger efforts to respond to student and staff trauma and promote overall wellness.

        <title>Talking back to the failing-schools narrative</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 15-18, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;PDK polls consistently show that parents give their children’s schools high marks but are dissatisfied with the performance of public schools nationally. This paradox may be explained by the persistent narrative of failing public schools that has dominated media coverage in the past 50 years. Authors Mark Hlavacik and Jack Schneider tracked the prevalence of the failing-schools narrative in print publications, books, and other media. They found connections between national coverage of education and local education reporting. This national narrative of failing schools uses public schools as a scapegoat, which absolves us of our collective responsibility to each other. A more nuanced and multifaceted narrative of public schools is needed.

        <title>Public opinion and the teaching profession</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-23, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Negative public perception of schools nationally impacts the teaching profession in direct and indirect ways. This perception has depressed the number of students in teacher preparation programs at universities. Indirectly, public perception affects teacher working conditions, compensation, and morale. Education advocates and researchers talk about the historical roots of perception of teachers, how and why negative perceptions persist, and how teachers can change the narrative.

        <title>Lessons from the early literacy tutoring landscape</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 31-36, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, tutoring has gained popularity as a strategy to improve the academic achievement of struggling students. Intensive, relationship-based tutoring is a highly effective academic support for many students. A range of tutoring approaches are available to accelerate young students’ literacy. Sarah Novicoff and Susanna Loeb discuss the research into early literacy tutoring and share the key elements found in effective programs.

        <title>Associations Between Administrative Burden and Children’s ECE Stability During the Covid-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic caused widespread closures of early care and education (ECE) facilities that negatively impacted children’s socioemotional, behavioral, and academic development. Policies permitting child care centers to remain open by obtaining waivers from closure directives involved varying levels of administrative burden. This study examined administrative burden within waiver policies and its association with ECE stability, as measured by children’s enrollment in waiver-obtaining child care centers. I found Black children were significantly less likely than White children to be enrolled in a waiver-obtaining center, and also far less likely to have a center that obtained a waiver very early on in the pandemic. Analyses showed rates of enrollment in waiver-obtaining centers were far lower among children whose centers experienced more administrative burden, and suggested racial disparities in ECE stability were driven by Black children’s concentrated residence in communities where the waiver application process was more burdensome.

        <title>Educational Philanthropy’s “Racial Reckoning” in the Wake of 2020: Understanding Grantmakers’ Responses to Racialized Crises</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-Black violence prompted talk of racial reckoning among educational grantmakers in 2020 to 2021. This study examines the nature and extent of this reckoning, offering insights into policy actors’ responses to racialized crises. Through an analysis of grantmakers’ professed policy repertoires—consisting of administrative practices, sites of intervention, and sources of expertise—we delineate the mechanisms shaping grantmaker responses to sociopolitical crises. While some grantmakers temporarily shifted administrative practices in response to COVID-19, deeper changes remained elusive. The study highlights how institutionalized white-centered norms and practices persist within educational policymaking, constraining material progress toward racial equity. Moreover, it underscores the pivotal role of proximity to racial injustice in motivating substantive changes to policy repertoires. We conclude with an appeal to grantmakers and other policy actors to shift from performative reckoning to tangible reparative actions that can weaken racialized structures.

        <title>Improving the Estimation of Site-Specific Effects and Their Distribution in Multisite Trials</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In multisite trials, researchers are often interested in several inferential goals: estimating treatment effects for each site, ranking these effects, and studying their distribution. This study seeks to identify optimal methods for estimating these targets. Through a comprehensive simulation study, we assess two strategies and their combined effects: semiparametric modeling of the prior distribution and alternative posterior summary methods tailored to minimize specific loss functions. Our findings highlight that the success of different estimation strategies depends largely on the amount of within-site and between-site information available from the data. We discuss how our results can guide balancing the trade-offs associated with shrinkage in limited data environments.

        <title>Learning through teaching: novice mathematics teacher educators coping with unfamiliarity</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is a growing research interest in examining how mathematics teacher educators grow professionally in their practice. In this study, we focus on the experiences of novice mathematics teacher educators who had been secondary mathematics teachers before becoming instructors of an elementary methods course. During individual, semi-structured interviews, the participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6) described their general experience in teaching the course and shared specific incidents that informed their practice. Our analysis reveals that this specific group of mathematics educators experienced multiple layers of unfamiliarity with the methods course, including unfamiliarity related to the elementary school context and to the course students, in response to which they adopted various coping strategies. We illustrate what novice mathematics teacher educators learned from their experiences of unfamiliarity, and how their expanded personal knowledge was reflected in their subsequent teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
