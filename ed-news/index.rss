        <title>Conceptualizing White-Ability Saviorism: A Necessary Reckoning With Ableism in Urban Teacher Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;White saviorism is a well-documented phenomenon in the education literature. Particularly, researchers have made connections between white saviorism and teacher preparation for urban contexts serving Students of Color negatively impacted by legacies of systemic racism. Scholars are increasingly taking an intersectional lens to understand the ways in which racism and ableism intersect, yet much of the literature on white saviorism does not critically examine the role of ableism. In this meta-ethnography, we review extant qualitative research on urban teacher preparation in an effort to extend the analysis to include a robust examination of ableism and deepen our understandings of white supremacy in these spaces. To this end, we conceptualize white-ability saviorism as a more comprehensive and precise way to understand the dynamics at play in urban teacher preparation that contribute to white supremacy and perpetuate educational inequities for urban Communities of Color.

        <title>Earth for all: Five policy turnarounds for a sustainable world</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The second in the new series of reviews for Action Research Journal is inspired by, and aims to contribute to, this journal’s focus on transformations towards sustainability. How can we, as action researchers, connect our emancipatory, grassroots work with the big global transformations needed to bring forth a just, harmonious and thriving world? When so much needs to transform, where do we start? In 2022, the Club of Rome offered a possible response in a new report called Earth for All, also published as a book and supporting website. Framed as ‘a survival guide for humanity’, Earth for All calls for ‘five extraordinary policy turnarounds’: ending poverty; addressing gross inequality; empowering women; making our food system healthy for people and ecosystems; and transitioning to clean energy. It is ‘an aspirational, stubbornly optimistic guide to the future’ (p. 26). It argues that action on these five big issues could give us the momentum we need to transform the economy in support of sustainability. Action researchers can help to give this agenda momentum by bringing it into our conversations with citizens and facilitating spaces for dialogue and agonism.

        <title>Supporting prospective mathematics teachers in noticing students&#39; proportional reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates the effect of a professional development program designed to develop prospective mathematics teachers’ ability to notice students’ proportional reasoning.  It examines how those teachers attended to student thinking, how they interpreted it, and how they decided to respond. Sixteen prospective teachers (PSTs) at a state university participated in a seven-week online professional development (PD) program. We provided participants with a research-based framework for proportional reasoning and engaged them in various ways via interviews with middle school students. They also wrote a reflection paper and received feedback. Combining multiple elements with interviewing was a unique feature of this program. The improvement in participants’ noticing skills was statistically significant. Specifically, in the post-assessment, the participants paid attention to most of the mathematical details of the students’ strategies, provided interpretations supported by conceptual underpinnings and evidence, and made research-based student-oriented decisions that focused on key issues. Implications for future teacher education practices and suggestions for further research are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coding and Computational Thinking Across the Curriculum: A Review of Educational Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teaching coding and computational thinking is an emerging educational imperative, now embedded in compulsory curriculum in the United States, Finland, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia. This meta-synthesis of 49 studies critically reviews recent international research (2009–2022) of coding and computational thinking as core and integrated across the curriculum. It addresses four essential problems: (a) What are the key features of learning environments that successfully develop students’ coding and computational thinking? (b) What is the impact of student engagement in coding and computational thinking on learning outcomes across curriculum areas? (c) What pedagogical constraints are evident for coding and computational thinking, including across curriculum areas? and (d) Which conceptual frameworks support coding and computational thinking, and what has been marginalized or excluded? The review advances knowledge of coding and computational thinking—vital to guide and develop future AI-based solutions to real-world problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries.

        <title>Teacher Shortages: A Framework for Understanding and Predicting Vacancies</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We develop a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting teacher shortages at the state, region, district, and school levels. We then empirically examine how teacher shortages vary geographically and by subject using data on unfilled teaching positions in Tennessee traditional public schools during Fall 2019. We find that teacher staffing challenges are highly localized, causing shortages and surpluses to coexist. Aggregate descriptions of staffing challenges mask considerable variation between schools and subjects within districts. Schools with fewer local early-career teachers, smaller district salary increases, worse working conditions, and higher historical attrition rates have higher vacancy rates. Our findings illustrate why viewpoints about, and solutions to, shortages depend critically on whether one takes an aggregate or local perspective.

        <title>The Next Chapter of Critical Educational Policy Research: Research Informing Policy Design</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Drawing on the special issue’s collection of articles, the following commentary examines the racial biases in K-12 and higher education policies and products revealing their seemingly neutral and objective facades to be inherently racialized and, at times, explicitly racist. The article also highlights the damaging effects of race-evasive language in K-12 and higher education, advocating for the prioritization of the most vulnerable students in policy and product design. Rooted in prior research and the author’s experiences as a Latina, a first-generation college student, and a former K -12 educator, the article argues for the abolition of harmful practices like corporal punishment and school resource officers. The author suggests that effective policy design for racial justice may require both mainstream and alternative approaches and highlights successful programs like Freedom Schools and ethnic studies programs. Lastly, the article emphasizes the need for educational policies to reflect a deep understanding of systemic racial inequities and for the research community to directly influence policy design towards equity and inclusion.

        <title>CTE Mechanisms: The Effects of Career and Technical Education Center Admissions Offers in Baltimore</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While there is a growing body of literature related to the benefits of participation in career and technical education (CTE) in high school, there remains a dearth of causal work in this area. Relying on administrative data from Baltimore City Public Schools, which uses a ranking system with a strict cut score to assign students into CTE-focused high schools, we employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of attending one of these high-quality CTE schools on attendance, career pathway completion, high school GPA, and SAT scores. We find that students who are offered admission to a program within one of the CTE centers are significantly more likely to complete a CTE pathway, though they present significantly lower GPAs. Implications are discussed.

        <title>Strategies for solving multiplicative problems using a conceptual model-based problem-solving approach. A case study with a student with autism spectrum disorder</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines the multiplicative problem-solving strategies used by a 14-year-old student with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities during an instructional process based on the Conceptual Model-based Problem Solving (COMPS) approach. The instruction aimed to enhance conceptual comprehension of problem-solving by the use of model diagrams representing mathematical relations involved in word problems. These diagrams aid in selecting the appropriate operation for each type of multiplicative problem, including equal-groups, multiplicative comparison, and combination problems. We further discuss how the instructional process promoted conceptual understanding for the three problem types, highlighting the development of strategies (modeling, counting, and operations) and the pivotal role of the COMPS methodology components in this progression. The results indicate that the student adeptly adopted the COMPS approach, facilitating the transition from informal modeling to written operations, with his choice of strategies varying depending on the type of problem. While there was a higher utilization of modeling strategies in equal-groups and combination problems, modeling was not as frequently employed in comparison problems. We speculate how this differentiated strategy preference could be associated with certain characteristics of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interrogating the equity promise for Black immigrant students in reformed mathematics classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As increasing numbers of Black immigrant students attend schools in Chile, we examine classroom practices to consider the limits of the mathematics education equity promise for this student population. We focus on the practices of a third-grade teacher who participated in professional development for enhancing reform-based mathematics teaching in a racially diverse classroom. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s approach to race, our analysis shows how two technologies of race-power fabricate the Black immigrant child as an uneducable and impossible mathematics learner. We contend that rather than enhancing the inclusion of Black immigrant students, reform-based mathematics teaching might maintain and reinforce racial hierarchies of mathematics ability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lesson study beyond its initial adaptation: a case without external support</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Since 2016, Park School in Denmark has consistently used Japanese lesson study as an approach to the professional development of its mathematics teachers. The school has moved beyond the initial adaptation of lesson study, and no longer includes external support. In this article, I investigate how three groups of teachers participated in the maturing lesson-study phases, especially the reflection phase. I apply social practice theory, particularly the concepts of figured worlds and improvisation, to examine the groups’ improvisation of artefacts and actions during lesson study, and the mature, valued outcomes. This study explains how and why the mature lesson-study efforts at Park School offer predominantly superficial learning opportunities to students and teachers alike. It concludes that in countries unaccustomed to lesson study, external support (or other external knowledge sources) is also important at the mature stages of its adaptation. This study proposes three activities that offer such support.

        <title>STEM teacher education programs for preservice and in-service secondary mathematics teachers: a review study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Few studies have elaborated on how different types of integration can support teachers’ learning and build their capacity to teach for the enhancement of students’ STEM competence. Teaching in a STEM education context requires mathematics teachers to be able to effectively choose, design and implement appropriate tasks in their classes. Given the important role of teachers and tasks as vehicles for STEM education, this paper reviews literature on STEM teacher education programs associated with STEM tasks for preservice and in-service secondary mathematics teachers. After searching for and reviewing the 14 relevant articles, the analytical results indicated that (a) teachers’ STEM knowledge and practices have not been commonly assessed as the outcomes of STEM teacher education programs, although they are explicitly counted as the goals of STEM teacher education programs; (b) the approach of multi-disciplinary concepts integrated with uni-disciplinary practice is mostly adopted as the approach to STEM integration; (c) task design features identified from the articles can be classified by elements of task design (i.e., goals, principles and instructional focus) and task design factors (i.e., disciplinary knowledge, cognition and metacognition, affect); and (d) most programs provide both acquisition and participation approaches to developing mathematics teachers’ knowledge in STEM education. The review results shed light on the design and implementation of STEM tasks and STEM teacher education programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers’ practices of integrating challenging demands of inclusive mathematics education in a professional development program</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When implementing educational innovations, teachers’ approaches to integrating new teaching demands are a crucial factor in their professional development. This becomes especially important in inclusive mathematics education, where teachers are demanded to integrate two jobs: (a) create joint learning experiences for all students and (b) provide focused learning opportunities for individuals. These jobs and the orientations in which they are pursued are perceived as conflicting demands by some teachers, while others do not. Within the model of content-related teacher expertise, this qualitative study investigates teachers’ practices for integrating these demands by disentangling the interplay between teachers’ self-reported practices and their underlying orientations about inclusive education. The analysis reveals that only some teachers explicate conflicts between inclusive teaching demands. It also shows that teachers command a variety of different practices for dealing with the new teaching demands and that some complex practices can indeed integrate different demands simultaneously. Implications include the insight that professional development programs on inclusive education should pay careful attention to teachers’ articulated jobs and orientations in order to promote the integration of teaching demands. Beyond this specific professional development content, the search for practices for integrating demands arising from an interplay of jobs and orientations might be a promising professional development research approach for increasing the scope of professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking plays an important role in supporting student learning. Yet little is known about how online professional development (PD)—a growing setting for PD in the USA—can cultivate this noticing. Here, we explore the potential of using two online tools for engaging video to support K-2 teachers’ noticing of students’ mathematical thinking in the context of a six-week online video-based PD program. While participating in the program, teachers used a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;commenting tool&lt;/em&gt; that allowed them to view video in its entirety and write a summary note, as well as a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tagging tool&lt;/em&gt; that allowed them to mark moments of video while viewing and associate notes with those moments. We found that teachers’ regular use of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tagging tool&lt;/em&gt; promoted their increased noticing of students’ mathematical thinking in video. Further, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;tagging tool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;commenting tool&lt;/em&gt; appeared to function in complementary ways to support teachers’ noticing. These findings contribute to the field’s growing understanding of how technological advances can support the development and study of mathematics teacher noticing, with implications for the design of online teacher learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;
