        <title>Putting the Instructional Leadership–Student Achievement Relation in Context: A Meta-Analytical Big Data Study Across Cultures and Time</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Aggregated data meta-analyses indicate a correlation between instructional leadership and student achievement. However, it is unclear to what extent this relationship can be generalized across cultural contexts, as most primary studies stem from Anglophone regions. Drawing on international large-scale assessment data, this 3-level individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis examines this relationship over a 6-year period using a sample of 1.5 million students in more than 50,000 schools from 75 countries. The findings show that the mean correlation is close to 0 and that the relationship between instructional leadership and student achievement varies significantly across contexts. This is mainly due to the level of human development and cultural factors. Implications for policy, practice, and education research are discussed.

        <title>Community-Based Teacher Education: The Experiences of Teacher Candidates Learning Alongside Grassroots Youth Organizers</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This community-based action research (CBAR) project acknowledges and disrupts existing systemic barriers to bring teacher candidates and grassroots youth organizers together through dialogue and reflection for transformative action. The practice of community-based pedagogy is described and utilized to demonstrate how critical understandings of community may imagine new ways of learning in conventional teacher education programs. This process enhances teacher candidates’ understanding and use of community-based pedagogy while supporting youth organizers in social justice initiatives within schools and communities. The findings, which draw from the CBAR project of a white, cis-gender woman who is a teacher educator-scholar-community organizer, provide implications for teacher educators aiming to foster collaborative partnerships with youth-centered grassroots community organizations and intergenerational community members. Teacher educators are invited to engage in paradigm shifts to curate community-based teacher education programs that are stimulated by and benefit local schools and communities.

        <title>Are Pre-Service Educators Prepared to Implement Personalized Learning?: An Alignment Analysis of Educator Preparation Standards</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Traction is growing for personalized learning (PL) as an educational innovation that aims to provide learning experiences to meet diverse learning needs. However, little research has investigated how PL is positioned in professional standards that provide guidance on teacher education across content-specific disciplines and for diverse learner populations. Using an alignment methodology, this study identified and analyzed 193 out of 654 educator preparation standard components in the U.S. education system for the presence of teaching practices that may better respond to the need for PL implementation. This research revealed different percentages of standard components reflecting expectations for educators to understand learner characteristics, tailor instruction to learner needs, and advocate for promoting learning outcomes for individual learners. Moreover, noticeable patterns exist among standards across disciplines and for diverse learner populations regarding how they focus on knowledge, competencies, and dispositions in relation to preparing educators for PL implementation.

        <title>University Students’ Understanding of Directional Derivative: An APOS Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study reports the second research cycle on students’ understanding of directional derivatives of two-variable functions. We applied Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) Theory as theoretical framework as in the first cycle. As a result of the first research cycle, a refined genetic decomposition describing the constructions that students may do to understand directional derivatives was proposed. Following the first cycle, we used the genetic decomposition to design didactical materials (a set of activities) to help students do the proposed constructions. The APOS theory pedagogical strategy, the ACE cycle, consisting of work on the activities in collaborative groups of three or four students, followed by whole class discussion and take-home exercises, was implemented in the classroom. In this study, we empirically test the genetic decomposition and the activity set resulting from the first research cycle by performing semi-structured interviews with a group of eleven students to see whether the GD as a model and the activity set were effective, needed to be refined, or to be rejected. We validated the genetic decomposition by showing that the didactical materials and the pedagogical method were productive and supported students’ construction of directional derivatives. Some aspects in which students’ understanding can be further improved are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evolution to Critical Race Theory: Kentucky Legislative Curriculum Bans in 1922 and 2022</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article draws from primary and secondary historical sources such as public policy documents, speeches, and media reports to trace attempts made by the Kentucky legislature to ban controversial topics in public school curriculum—evolution in 1922 and critical race theory in 2022. Kingdon’s multiple streams framework (MSF) serves as the model for this historical and contemporary comparative education policy analysis.

        <title>The Evolution of Coaching as a Policy Instrument: How a District Engages in Organizational Learning</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many U.S. school districts now rely on instructional coaching to promote reform. Yet facets of coaching policy remain vague, and there is considerable variation in the structures and practices of coaching. We use longitudinal, qualitative data to analyze changes in instructional coaching, as a capacity building policy instrument, in one mid-sized urban-emergent school district from 2014 to 2019. Applying concepts of organizational learning theory, this paper documents how district leaders designed and implemented three distinct forms of coaching. We argue coaching shifted from a tool for teacher support, to a resource for school improvement, and lastly to a lever for boosting coherence. Further, we demonstrate how particular problems and leaders triggered different degrees of organizational learning on–and changes to–coaching. In sum, the paper explains how a district alters the definitions and structures of instructional coaching. By illuminating how educational leaders tinker with capacity building instruments, this paper contributes to the instructional reform literature and advances the field’s understanding of the evolution of capacity-building instruments.

        <title>Open modelling problems: cognitive barriers and instructional prompts</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Open mathematical modelling problems that can be solved with multiple methods and have multiple possible results are an important part of school curricula in mathematics and science. Solving open modelling problems in school should prepare students to apply their mathematical knowledge in their current and future lives. One characteristic of these problems is that information that is essential for solving the problems is missing. In the present study, we aimed to analyze students’ cognitive barriers while they solved open modelling problems, and we evaluated the effects of instructional prompts on their success in solving such problems. A quantitative experimental study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 263) and a qualitative study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 4) with secondary school students indicated that identifying unknown quantities and making numerical assumptions about these quantities are important cognitive barriers to solving open modelling problems. Task-specific instructional prompts helped students overcome these barriers and improved their solution rates. Students who were given instructional prompts included numerical assumptions in their solutions more often than students who were not given such prompts. These findings contribute to theories about solving open modelling problems by uncovering cognitive barriers and describing students’ cognitive processes as they solve these problems. In addition, the findings contribute to improving teaching practice by indicating the potential and limitations of task-specific instructional prompts that can be used to support students’ solution processes in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enacting multilingual learner core practices: a PST’s approximations of practice of mathematics language routines</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study considered a preservice teacher’s (PST’s) attention to multilingual learner core practices within her approximations of practice of mathematics language routines during a secondary mathematics methods course. We used a framework of approximations of practice to understand how a PST enacted and developed an understanding of multilingual learner core practices. To provide a vision for what multilingual learner core practices can look like in nontraditional instructional contexts, we qualitatively analyzed four approximations of practice of mathematics language routines from a single PST during a single semester of a methods course. We share how she navigated the remote teaching context and engaged sample students in all of the multilingual learner core practices despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing an example of what these practices may look like in remote instruction. We also discuss how these multilingual learner core practices interact and complement one another. We consider possible implications, limitations, and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Context Matters as Racialization Evolves: Exploring Bias in Preservice Teacher Responses to Children</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study explores preservice teacher attributions to children’s behaviors portrayed in specific emotion-laden school scenarios. Participants included 178 preservice teachers from three universities. The preservice teachers viewed video vignettes of Black and White child actors in six different school scenarios. Our team constructed two themes from the preservice teachers’ narratives about what they saw: (a) context matters (i.e., different scenarios activate different preservice teacher attributions), and (b) racialization evolves (i.e., preservice teachers make different attributions about Black and White boys engaged in the same behaviors). Findings underscore the importance of teacher education and professional development for novice teachers that address racial bias in attributions of student behaviors.

        <title>Preparing the Expert Novice: Preservice Teacher Thinking and Efficacy in Inquiry Design</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this study, we share the understandings and the reflections of preservice teachers as they engage in focus group interviews about inquiry in social studies, generally, and their reactions to publicly available Inquiry Design Model blueprints. These preservice teachers first discussed their understanding of inquiry, which was rooted in their university coursework. They then described their self-efficacy for implementing inquiry, generally, and the IDM blueprint, specifically, in their current field placements and future classrooms. This envisioned implementation often involved adaptations of the blueprints. Our goal in this research was to reconsider how preservice teachers experience and learn about social studies inquiry and, as a result of these experiences, whether and how they see themselves implementing social studies inquiry with students. This study can inform teacher educators to proactively address common barriers and better support preservice teachers.

        <title>A Tale of Two Systems: Choice and Equity in the District of Columbia’s Charter Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Advocates often predict that school choice policies will expand access to high-quality schools, particularly for marginalized communities. To interrogate this assumption, we employed a sequential mixed-methods analysis examining the state of charter reform in the District of Columbia. We observed that stakeholders consistently defined equity as uniform processes, evident in data distribution and enrollment practices. We also uncovered persistent disparities in where students live versus learn. We conclude that race-neutral conceptions of equity may hinder attempts to improve school access by ignoring structural inequalities tied to race, place, and income and by overlooking privileged households’ efforts to remain separate.

        <title>Restorative Justice in Education: A Content Analysis of US State Legislation From 2010 to 2020</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study sought to understand how state-level policies inform and promote the implementation of restorative justice in education (RJE). A content analysis of 60 laws revealed that definitions, structures, and supports varied greatly, causing us to question whether policies support a systematic implementation of RJE and how policies can prevent the misuse of RJE as an alternative system of punishment. We recommend that laws clearly define the paradigm shift underlying RJE, and provide sustained support to promote a realignment of policies and practices with attention to incorporating measures of accountability to larger values surrounding equity and justice.

        <title>Utilizing Real-Time Test Data to Solve Attenuation Paradox in Computerized Adaptive Testing to Enhance Optimal Design</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;To solve the attenuation paradox in computerized adaptive testing (CAT), this study proposes an item selection method, the integer programming approach based on real-time test data (IPRD), to improve test efficiency. The IPRD method turns information regarding the ability distribution of the population from real-time test data into feasible test constraints to reversely assembled shadow tests for item selection to prevent the attenuation paradox by integer programming. A simulation study was conducted to thoroughly investigate IPRD performance. The results indicate that the IPRD method can efficiently improve CAT performance in terms of the precision of trait estimation and satisfaction of all required test constraints, especially for conditions with stringent exposure control.

        <title>Exploring the Impact of the Corequisite Classroom Climate on Students’ Attitudes Toward Mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many postsecondary institutions across the United States have adopted the corequisite model of academic support to facilitate student learning and the successful completion of introductory mathematics courses within students’ first year of college enrollment. While research have highlighted the benefits of corequisites in terms of academic outcomes, there is little qualitative research on the impact of this model of academic support on students beyond course grades. Through student narratives, this study documents how one university implemented their College Algebra corequisite and investigates the impact of the classroom climate of a corequisite course on students’ attitudes toward mathematics. This study shows that though the classroom climate positively impacted the participants’ attitudes toward mathematics in general, the climate of the corequisite specifically had a greater impact on their beliefs about mathematics and perceptions of themselves as learners of mathematics. However, there were some identified drawbacks to the corequisite course including time-consuming coursework and occasionally unproductive group collaboration. These findings highlight the potential for corequisites to foster positive attitudes toward mathematics, yet it also demonstrated a need for greater intention in the course development to ensure a coherent course structure where course activities and assessments give way to meaningful and productive student engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Different Methods for Assessing Preservice Teachers’ Instruction: Why Measures Matter</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teacher preparation programs are increasingly expected to use data on preservice teacher (PST) skills to drive program improvement and provide targeted supports. Observational ratings are especially vital, but also prone to measurement issues. Scores may be influenced by factors unrelated to PSTs’ instructional skills, including rater standards. Yet we know little about how these measurement challenges play out in the preservice context specifically. Here, we investigate the reliability and sensitivity of two observational measures. We find measures collected during student teaching are especially prone to measurement issues; only 3% to 4% of variation in scores reflects consistent differences between PSTs, while 9% to 17% of variation can be attributed to the mentors with whom they work. When high scores stem not from strong instructional skills, but instead from external circumstances, we cannot use them to make consequential decisions about PSTs’ individual needs or readiness for independent teaching.

        <title>Reframing High-Quality Mentoring: Between Teacher Mentoring and Visions of Teaching as a Profession</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Visions of teacher professionalism may shape common conceptualizations of high-quality mentoring, sometimes distortedly. Nevertheless, this relationship is often unnoticed, and studies rarely analyze mentor–teachers’ work according to their interrelating visions. This multiple case study aimed at this literature gap. It examined the goals that accomplished mentor-teachers promoted and their practices and found four mentoring styles that characterized these mentors. After, it interrogated how the mentoring styles interrelated with three distinct visions of teacher professionalism (teachers as intellectuals, craftspeople, or artists). Findings challenge the idea that mentor-teachers’ work can be evaluated as either advancing or degrading teacher professionalism. The study questions this framing of mentoring literature and suggests that a bipolar logic could mislead us to forsake essential aspects of mentoring, for instance, ones associated with apprenticeship relations. The study concludes by offering to replace the bipolar logic with a more balanced consideration of the different aspects of teacher mentoring.

        <title>Transforming collaboration between communities and non-governmental organisations: Reflections on learning spaces in Central-Eastern Uganda</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Non-governmental organisations have several mechanisms in place to facilitate learning with and from communities they intend to serve, however these do not always realise authentic participation and meaningful programmatic adjustments. In a participatory research in Central-Eastern Uganda we investigated how the community believes collective learning with NGOs could best be shaped. In this paper we present findings as well as reflections on the learning spaces that emerged in the research and how one could assess whether collective learning is a transformative practice. We offer a conceptual framework NGO practitioners can use to enrich their collective learning toolkit as well as to track and trace small shifts and changes happening in learning trajectories in order to lobby for resources to allow collective learning to happen more authentically, through increased presence and informal interaction with communities.

        <title>Advocacy Stories: Equity Literacy Practices of White Low Income Mothers Navigating School Reform</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article, based on collaborative ethnography, describes five low income white mothers’ equity literacy practices as they advocated for their children&#39;s diverse “failing” school during a state takeover. Mothers used both hard and soft advocacy. They promoted equity by reinforcing positive aspects of the school community, and resisting and reframing negative stories perpetuated about the school based on stigma at the intersection of race, class, and standardized educational attainment. They shared the ideal of exposing their children to “real life” by staying loyal to their school. However, their advocacy can also be understood as subtly reifying whiteness. These mothers’ stories present possibilities, and challenges, for realizing interracial solidarity that fosters and sustains equitable schooling in the United States long term.
