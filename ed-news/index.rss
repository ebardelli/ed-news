        <title>AI and Psychometrics: Epistemology, Process, and Politics</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;If psychometrics has long concerned itself with validity, reliability, and fairness, then what could psychometrics learn from the cybernetic theories of AI? Through engagement with Burstein’s (2023) Responsible AI Standards, this paper unpacks some paradigmatic differences between psychometrics and cybernetics, points to how recursivity and contingency are both a challenge and opportunity for psychometrics, and how this matters epistemologically, ethically and politically. Following these epistemological differences, the paper raises ethico-political concerns with the promise of the “human-in-the-loop”.

        <title>Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs With Multiple Control Groups Under One-Sided Noncompliance: Evaluating Extended Time Accommodations</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Since its conception by Thistlethwaite and Campbell, a regression discontinuity (RD) design has continuously evolved and progressed in various aspects. This paper explores a novel theoretical advancement in fuzzy RD designs by combining them with multiple control groups under one-sided noncompliance. Within this approach, we estimate the average treatment effect on the treated at the cutoff from the fuzzy RD design and construct its bounds derived from multiple control groups. Using the bounds as a sensitivity check, we examine whether the underlying causal or statistical assumptions for the fuzzy RD design are warranted. We verify the effectiveness of our approach via a simulation study and demonstrate its application by studying the effect of extended time accommodations using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

        <title>Reviewing Concentrated Poverty Literature Through an Antiblackness Lens to Reveal a Concentrated Debt</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The relationship between concentrated poverty and educational outcomes has received substantial attention in academic research over the last 3 decades. Researchers have argued that neighborhood characteristics are associated with academic achievement, educational attainment, dropout rates, college entry, cognitive abilities, attendance, and grade repetition. Given that Black students constitute a large proportion of those living in concentrated poverty, coupled with the urgency of contemporary times where state-sanctioned violence is on full display in the United States, assessing how education scholars are conceptualizing concentrated poverty is vital. Utilizing an antiblackness lens to critically review 64 recent articles addressing concentrated poverty and educational outcomes, we explicitly drew on anti-Black scholarship to expand the discourse from “concentrated poverty” to a “concentrated debt.” A concentrated debt constitutes education, racial capital, placemaking, and humanity debts. We argue that to address these debts, we must move beyond deficits, lacks, and disorganization of Black neighborhoods and toward humanizing Black students and their families by investing in their homes, schools, and communities.

        <title>“Flights for Freedom With Her Words”: Black, Latinx, and Polynesian Girls Co-Conspiring Against Misogynoir Through Love</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;I examine how youth racialized and gendered as Black girls co-conspired to challenge misogynoir with their peers racialized and gendered as Latina/x and Polynesian girls. I investigate how they did so within an after-school space at a public charter high school that came to be known as the “Critical Feminisms Club.” Thinking about the space alongside the girls in the club, I reveal how they politically and pedagogically engaged love to (a) (re)author the stories of Black girls and (b) challenge the material and ideological misogynoir that circumscribed Black girls’ lives, possibilities, and futurities within their lives and schooling. They (re)narrated how they should be in relation with and responsible to each other as collective, co-relational, and interdependent beings, recognizing how Black womanness/girlness was a genre of being human that was specifically targeted for enclosure, exploitation, and elimination. Their love-politics engaged pedagogy to remake the world such that the safety and protection of Black girls and gender-nonconforming youth was a necessity and priority, which they saw in turn as bound to the safety and protection of the non-Black identified Latina/x and Polynesian girls who accepted this interdependence and mutual responsibility.

        <title>Exploring mathematical wellbeing across cultures: insights from diverse students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Across many countries, including New Zealand, diverse groups including indigenous, migrant, and marginalised communities, are under-represented in mathematics, as evidenced by achievement disparities and disengagement from higher-level mathematics. Both research and policy have focused on developing equitable education outcomes for all students. A key aspect of this is wellbeing, including within mathematics classrooms, which includes identifying classroom environments that enable wellbeing. This study examines mathematical wellbeing (MWB) across different ethnicities and genders, with a case study focus on students from Pacific heritages. Analysing qualitative responses from over 12,000 diverse students revealed that positive relationships in the mathematics classroom were most commonly associated with students’ MWB. Accomplishment and cognitive factors, including mathematical accuracy, learning new things, and understanding, were also identified as important. Minor gender differences emerged, with female students emphasising mathematical understanding, accuracy, and relationships more than male students. The Pacific student case study highlighted the importance of both cognitive aspects (learning new things and understanding) and relationships (peer and teacher support), uncovering an alignment between cultural values and MWB. This study empirically confirms seven universal values supporting student MWB, previously identified in Australian and Chinese contexts, suggesting that teachers internationally may align pedagogical practices with these values to support most students’ MWB. However, the instrumental values serving these universal values appear culturally unique. This research contributes novel insights to the field by examining wellbeing with a subject-specific focus through student-generated responses, offering implications for developing more equitable and culturally inclusive mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beliefs of Undergraduate Mathematics Education Students in a Teacher Education Program about Visual Programming in Mathematics Classes</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the digital age, the range of digital technologies used in mathematics education grows. Since beliefs are affective-cognitive elements that significantly determine teachers&#39; behavior in the classroom, they are an interesting field of research in mathematics education. A review of previous research has identified different groups of beliefs about the use of digital technologies in mathematics classes. These studies are not focused on specific digital technologies. In an empirical case study that is presented in this paper, the aim was to figure out how beliefs that can be described specifically about the use of visual programming relate to general beliefs about the use of digital technologies in mathematics education. A qualitative content analysis of the reflection journals of seven undergraduate mathematics education students on their work with Scratch, a visual programming environment, in a university seminar led to the formation of ten belief categories about the use of visual programming in mathematics classes. Most of the beliefs are associated with a positive attitude towards visual programming in mathematics education. However, some beliefs could also be identified that refer to the limits and challenges of using visual programming and thus demonstrate rather negative associations. Only a few of the categories identified match the list of belief groups about digital technologies in mathematics education identified in previous research. Some possible reasons for these results are discussed and further research interests in the field of beliefs about the use of digital technologies are suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Dishwasher System: Dealing with Defamation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As a person obsessed, perhaps overly so, with preventing water damage, an ailing dishwasher led to a system whereby who did the dishes in our household became a matter of chance. What happened next, however, was besmirchment of my character from hockey teammates, close friends, and especially from a room full of future elementary school mathematics teachers. Most individuals, from those casting aspersions, were not even able to support their slander by, for example, providing me with a simple solution, the kind you would find in the back of a school mathematics textbook, demonstrating that the dishwasher system I had implemented was unfair. Making matters worse, data collected from a simulation of my system did not result in probabilistic discussions regarding order mattering, the number of outcomes, the assignment of labels, lists or diagrams; rather, a flimsily understanding of the data resulted in a rather raucous echo chamber where my fate was sealed. Unable to sit idly by any longer, I proposed a tweak to the system, which preyed on a school yard notion of fairness, that helped me regain my honour and perhaps proved that revenge is a dish best served cold.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kindergarten and First-Grade Students’ Understandings of Arithmetic Properties Across Different Kinds of Problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this article, we present research on eight kindergarten and eight first-grade students’ understandings of the arithmetic properties of commutativity, additive identity, and additive inverse during a classroom teaching experiment, selected from a larger study that included 88 students. In this study, we explore the students’ types of understandings in terms of Skemp’s (1987) framework (instrumental and relational), the basic relationships in the conceptual field of additive structures (combination, transformation, and comparison), and their performance on different problems involving numerical operations, equations, and word problems. Our findings show that students performed better on additive identity and additive inverse properties. Problems involving substituting and simplifying expressions that combined two properties had a lower performance rate. The differences in understandings and performance observed between kindergarten and first-grade students have implications for instructional design geared to introduce arithmetic properties in the early grades. This study highlights the difference between correctly solving a problem and providing evidence of a relational understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fugitive Care: The Politics of Care Enacted by Afro-Caribbean Women Teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The future of teaching will increasingly rely on overseas-trained teachers (OTTs) to address teacher shortages. While research on OTTs in the United States is expanding, studies focusing on Afro-Caribbean teachers are emerging. Despite the growing call for more teachers of color, Afro-Caribbean OTTs’ contributions are often overlooked due to their immigrant status. We propose the concepts of “radical transparency” and “fugitive care” to articulate how these teachers’ classroom practices offer alternative possibilities for schooling, making the learning process both explicit and equitable for all students. Drawing on a Transnational Black Feminist Framework (TBF), we highlight the unique politics of care practiced by these teachers, revealing gaps in our cultural understanding and underscoring their vital, yet understudied, contributions to education.

        <title>Redefining Item Response Models for Small Samples</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Popular item response theory (IRT) models are considered complex, mainly due to the inclusion of a random factor variable (latent variable). The random factor variable represents the incidental parameter problem since the number of parameters increases when including data of new persons. Therefore, IRT models require a specific estimation method and large samples for accurate parameter estimation. The two-parameter IRT model is redefined by analytically integrating out the random person factor in the latent response formulation of the model to make it suitable for small sample applications. This IRT Bayesian covariance structure model (IRT-BCSM) describes the clustering of (latent) responses by persons through a structured covariance matrix in which a common covariance parameter represents the dependence implied by a unidimensional random factor variable. The IRT-BCSM is a latent-variable-free model and consists of (fixed) item parameters and a common covariance parameter, where person parameters can be post-hoc sampled. An efficient Gibbs sampler is proposed for parameter estimation. In simulation studies, the performance of the IRT-BCSM is compared to two-parameter IRT models for small samples, and results show an optimal performance of the IRT-BCSM even in sample sizes as small as 50 to 100 persons and 5 to 10 items. Generalizations of the IRT-BCSM show that a redefinition of more complex IRT models also lead to much more efficient parameterizations, which can broaden the scope of IRT applications.

        <title>Evaluating Intersectional Fairness in Algorithmic Decision Making Using Intersectional Differential Algorithmic Functioning</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Ensuring fairness is crucial in developing modern algorithms and tests. To address potential biases and discrimination in algorithmic decision making, researchers have drawn insights from the test fairness literature, notably the work on differential algorithmic functioning (DAF) by Suk and Han. Nevertheless, the exploration of intersectionality in fairness investigations, within both test fairness and algorithmic fairness fields, is still relatively new. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAF framework to include the concept of intersectionality. Similar to DAF, the proposed notion for intersectionality, which we term “interactive DAF,” leverages ideas from test fairness and algorithmic fairness. We also provide methods based on the generalized Mantel–Haenszel test, generalized logistic regression, and regularized group regression to detect DAF, interactive DAF, or other subtypes of DAF. Specifically, we employ regularized group regression with three different penalties and examine their performance via a simulation study. Finally, we demonstrate our intersectional DAF framework in real-world applications on grade retention and conditional cash transfer programs in education.

        <title>First encounter with constructing graphs in the functional thinking approach to school algebra in 3rd and 4th grades</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Given the relevance of graphs of functions, we consider their inclusion in primary education from the functional approach to early algebra. The purpose of this article is to shed some light on the students’ production and reading of graphs when they solved generalization problems from a functional thinking approach. We aim to explore how 3rd and 4th graders construct graphs associated to functions and what elements they use; and how they read function associated graphs and whether they connect pairs of values to see beyond the data. After four working sessions about functions, we designed and implemented individual interviews to 12 students. Through a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the students can read data in a graph on two different cognitive levels and also construct it from different elements of the graph initially provided. Regarding data reading, we evidence two levels: (a) literal reading of a given element in the graph, and (b) reading beyond the data. The construction of the graph is described with base on the axes, values and labels on the axes, scale of the axes, and construction techniques. We present examples of students’ work that evidence that graph construction varied depending on whether it was created from a blank sheet or it was necessary to provide help regarding the axes or the scale of the graph. We describe several techniques used by the students in the representation of data that yield non-canonical representations of a graph and that help glimpse how students are interpreting this representation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Publishing mathematics education research in English: amplifying voices from the field</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper we investigate the issue of representation within the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education&lt;/em&gt; (JMTE) and the broader academic publishing landscape, particularly focusing on the underrepresentation of authors from various world regions. A questionnaire, distributed globally, aimed to amplify the voices of the underrepresented, exploring the constraints and affordances of publishing in English-medium mathematics education research journals. The question that guided our investigation was: What do voices from the mathematics education community raise in their responses to questions about publishing in English-medium research journals like JMTE? We used qualitative methods to review the responses and identify common themes. The findings revealed significant barriers and challenges related to language, research location, and institutional support, highlighting the complexities of navigating the global academic community and the academic publishing culture. We propose actionable suggestions to foster a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive publishing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Critical elements of the expertise of mathematics teacher educators (MTE) can be identified in the artifacts they design for working with prospective teachers (PT), specifically for engaging PT in the double role of practitioners and students of practice. While MTE are increasingly utilizing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; multimodal representations of practice (such as storyboards), theoretical frameworks and methods for analyzing these pedagogical artifacts and the meanings they support are still in early development. We utilize a semiotic framework, expanding systemic functional linguistics to encompass non-linguistic elements, to identify aspects of what we call &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;navigational expertise—&lt;/em&gt;which supports PTs in engaging both as practitioners and students of the practice&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; We view this expertise as tacit knowledge-in-use, enacted through artifact production. The paper demonstrates MTE’s navigational expertise by showing how MTE design storyboards of practice to engage PT as fellow teachers experiencing the lesson taught by a peer &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as university students who consider the artifact (including the represented lesson) as an object of study. The framework allows us to identify how MTE’s navigational expertise lies in seamlessly interweaving these two purposes and navigating between them, knowing when, how, and for what purposes to invoke each. Through analysis of storyboards from four MTE in diverse US settings, we uncover some of the nuanced tacit components of navigational expertise, highlighting linguistic and non-linguistic design choices and their potential meanings for transactions with PT.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Principal Leadership of Pre-K Programs in Elementary Schools: Evidence from North Carolina</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Pre-Kindergarten (Pre-K) programs are becoming increasingly common in elementary schools across the United States—in fact, a recent analysis of federal data revealed that 57% of public schools have a Pre-K grade. Despite the prevalence of Pre-K programs in schools, principals—known to be among the most important factors in school success—often lack the knowledge and professional supports to effectively lead Pre-K programs. In this study, guided by sensemaking theory, we work to advance knowledge on Pre-K principal leadership through a sequential mixed-methods analysis of elementary school principals in the state of North Carolina. Our study includes a statewide survey of all lead and assistant principals in the state (N = 520) as well as follow-up interviews with 27 of the surveyed principals. Our findings reveal that while they report strong conceptual support for the Pre-K programs in their schools, principals demonstrate limited engagement with them. We also find that principal background and preparation in early education and the proportion of students from a Pre-K program that ultimately enroll in the school for kindergarten are important factors that help explain variation in principal orientations to Pre-K leadership.
