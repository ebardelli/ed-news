        <title>A Best-Evidence Synthesis and Meta-analysis on Effective Reading Programs in Spanish</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of Spanish reading programs in grades K–6. The research designs included were experimental and quasi-experimental. Effect sizes were analyzed using a multivariate meta-regression model with robust variance estimation. To assess the degree of heterogeneity in the effect sizes, a 95% prediction interval was calculated. A total of 11 studies and 51 effect sizes met the inclusion criteria. The full meta-regression model controlling for grade level and outcome type showed a large positive effect across all studies (effect size = 0.49, p &amp;lt; 0.05), with a large, positive effect on reading outcomes, and significant impacts on phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, and reading comprehension in K–2. Results suggest that effective instructional programs for K–6 Spanish reading exist. However, there is a need for more rigorous research on reading instructional programs for Spanish-speaking children.

        <title>Mathematics teacher educators’ discussion practice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Descriptions of expertise have focused on knowledge and characteristics of mathematics teacher educator (MTE) practice. To contribute to discussion of MTE expertise we share findings from a study of MTE discussion practice with prospective teachers (PTs) concerning pedagogy of teaching mathematics. Research on MTE discussion practices have shown there are key differences between discussions of mathematics and mathematics teaching in professional development, making clear MTEs’ discussion practices in mathematics methods courses focused on mathematics and mathematics teaching must differ. In this paper we focus on MTEs&#39; discussion practice in initial teacher education settings, building from empirical findings that include descriptions of MTEs&#39; discussion practice focused on mathematics teaching. Specifically, we address the question: What is our mathematics teacher educators’ pedagogy of discussion practice? Using self-study methodology and data from two primary sources: (1) transcripts of 8 critical friend conversations, and (2) evidentiary maps created using course artifacts, we use vignettes to describe three characteristics: anticipating preservice teachers’ thinking, layering instructional activities, and preservice teachers’ move toward independence in teaching practice. Findings from this study and mathematics education literature are used to support the claim that MTEs use anticipating, layering, and handover to independence as a system to promote PTs’ discussion of mathematics teaching in methods courses. Findings are used to draw conclusions about MTE expertise of discussion practice and the importance of selfbased methodologies in research on MTE expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Developing Teachers’ Disciplinary Knowledge for High School STEM Integration: A Review of a Decade of Educational Research</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Increasing calls for greater STEM-integrated experiences in K–12 education have spawned numerous studies on teacher beliefs, educational goals, and practices for teaching and learning. However, how the field proposes to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge appears to be underresearched. In this systematic review, we analyzed 110 articles to determine (a) in what ways has the literature focused on teacher learning, (b) to what extent the literature addressed the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge, and (c) to what extent the literature identified mechanisms for developing teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge. Results reveal needs that include, among others, more studies focused on developing teacher disciplinary knowledge; studies that differentiate teacher needs at different grade levels; studies that differentiate mechanisms aimed at developing teachers’ pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and disciplinary knowledge; and studies that explicitly examine the mechanisms being used to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge.

        <title>POLICY SOLUTIONS: Should school board elections be partisan?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/4&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-51, December 2024/January 2025. &lt;br/&gt;Should school board elections be partisan? Jonathan E. Collins writes about the pros and cons of bringing political parties back into school board elections. While partisan elections can bring more voter participation and interest in school governance, they also run the risk of pushing aside real education issues for culture war distractions.

        <title>UNDER THE LAW: The (mis)education of Indigenous students</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/4&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-53, December 2024/January 2025. &lt;br/&gt;Indigenous students in the U.S. — including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children — have faced a history of serious educational mistreatment. Today, the abusive boarding school program has ended, but Indigenous children still experience formidable challenges. Robert Kim describes laws related to schools funded by the Bureau of Indian Education, studies showing how the federal government has fallen short of its responsibilities, and a recent case attempting to hold the government accountable.

        <title>BACKTALK: Finding the sweet spot between curriculum fidelity and teacher agency</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/4&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, December 2024/January 2025. &lt;br/&gt;Two common perspectives on the implementation of curriculum and instructional strategies often appear to be at odds. On one side are those who call for fidelity to designers’ plans. On the other side are those who call for the empowerment of teachers to meet individual student needs, regardless of the pace required by curriculum guides. Ronald S. Thomas explains how teachers can use data to find a sweet spot between these approaches.

        <title>Do Holocaust education mandates work?</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/4&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-47, December 2024/January 2025. &lt;br/&gt;In the context of both rising antisemitism in the U.S. and the increasing popularity of states mandating the teaching of the Holocaust in K-12 schools, William Smith asks, are such legislative mandates effective? Can states achieve ambitious goals like preventing future genocides and reducing antisemitism by requiring that students learn about the Holocaust? He reviews the limited research on Holocaust education mandates, and Holocaust education generally, with analysis suggesting that such curriculum mandates may not be having the desired effects on student learning. He poses theories about the factors limiting the effectiveness of these mandates.

        <title>Beyond the math wars: Focus on teachers to improve instruction</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/4&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-13, December 2024/January 2025. &lt;br/&gt;The field of mathematics education has engaged in perennial debate about whether transmission-oriented or constructivist approaches to teaching will best help students learn. Yet, both fluency, learned through step-by-step procedural instruction, and the mathematical flexibility that comes from constructivist methods play an important role in mathematical achievement. Rachel S. McClam and Rebecca A. Cruz explain that the math wars debate acts as a straw man, with each side misrepresenting the other and detracting from what students really need — but often lack — to be successful in math: teachers who understand how both approaches work together to support students to become confident and knowledgeable mathematicians.
