        <title>“Yes, I Can!” A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Intervention Studies Promoting Teacher Self-Efficacy</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A high level of teacher self-efficacy is considered to be important for a successful and healthy teaching career. This preregistered meta-analysis focuses on whether and to what degree interventions can promote teacher self-efficacy. We included 115 studies representing 11,284 pre-service and in-service teachers in our meta-analysis. Interventions had a significant, positive effect on the promotion of teachers’ self-efficacy (g = 0.47, RVE SE = 0.04, 95% CI = [0.40, 0.54]) with no significant differences between pre- and in-service teachers. A fine-grained coding and systematic review of the targeted sources of self-efficacy according to Bandura’s sociocognitive theory revealed that overall interventions including mastery experiences did not significantly differ from those without. However, interventions targeting only mastery experiences were the most successful for pre-service teachers (g = 0.62, RVE SE = 0.11, CI = [0.35, 0.88]). Based on further moderator analyses, we recommend interventions to integrate reflective elements. Finally, future research should apply stricter study designs and more detailed intervention descriptions.

        <title>Sociomathematical scaffolding as students engage in revising draft definitions, conjectures, and proofs</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Instructors manage several tensions as they engage students in defining, conjecturing, and proving, including building on students’ contributions while maintaining the integrity of certain mathematical norms. This paper presents a case study of a teacher-researcher who was particularly skilled in balancing these tensions in a laboratory setting. We introduce sociomathematical scaffolding, which refers to the scaffolding of normative aspects for mathematical discourse. We found that the teacher-researcher’s sociomathematical scaffolding entailed inquiring into the students’ intended meaning of their draft and then supporting students in revising their draft to adhere to mathematical norms. We illustrate this pattern in three episodes in which the teacher-researcher supported a pair of students to revise their drafted (1) definition of unbounded above sequences, (2) conjecture of the Archimedean Property, and (3) proof by contraction of the Archimedean Property.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The effects of functional moves in teacher questioning on students’ contextualization of mathematical word problem solving</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Posing purposeful questions is one of the most effective teaching practices (NCTM in Principles to actions: Ensuring mathematics success for all. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2014). Although the types and functions of teacher questioning have been abundantly studied, research on the role of teacher questioning in students’ contextualization process as they solve word problems is rather scarce. This study was conducted to investigate the function of six elementary preservice teachers’ questioning, its impact on students’ contextualization, as well as the successes and difficulties of enacting questioning. The collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicated that the implementation of task clarification (TC) moves effectively enhanced contextualization only when students possessed a relatively strong sense of agency while solving word problems. Furthermore, when students’ attentional focus was not appropriately redirected by the functional moves, including procedural understanding (PU), making connections (MC), the rationale behind a strategy (RA), and an alternative strategy (AS), their understanding of the contextual features and construction of mathematical relationships in word problem solving could not be refined. Implications for field experience design and future research on the quality of teacher questioning in mathematics teacher education programs are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Towards Anti-Carceral Leadership: Remaking Public Schools to Refuse Black Students’ Surveillance, Containment, and Control</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The social movement for #PoliceFreeSchools (and the adjacent campaign on college and university campuses called #PoliceFreeCampuses) welcomes an opportunity to reimagine school discipline and safety in contradistinction to current carceral forms. Scholars have moved away from notions of “school to prison pipeline” by demonstrating the many ways schools are organized as carceral spaces (e.g., school-prison nexus). A conceptual framework of Anti-carceral leadership is put forward in this paper to underscore the need for a leadership paradigm that actively refuses the logics of the carceral state (e.g., social control). The paper underscores how the logics of antiblackness may sustain mechanisms of social control in education policy intended to undo racialized harm. The tensions of be(com)ing an anti-carceral leader and its significance for undoing technologies of punishment, confinement, and constraint that reinforce schooling as a site of Black pain and suffering are discussed.

        <title>The Disruptive Power of Policy Erasure: How State Legislators and School Boards Fail to Take up Trans-affirming Policies While Leaning into Anti-LGBTQ+ Policies</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Since 2017, hostile anti-LGBTQ+ educational bills rapidly expanded. Using traditional and critical policy analysis across three Midwestern states, we examine (1) whether state and local policymakers (n = 60) adopted trans-inclusive protections aligned with the 2017 federal Whitaker ruling, (2) the spread and scope of state and local educational policies concerning LGBTQ+ people, and (3) relationships between LGBTQ and critical race theory (CRT) curricular bills. We find policy erasure in states without pre-Whitaker gender-inclusive nondiscrimination laws and expanded efforts to ban LGBTQ+ students from educational opportunities, spaces, and curriculum. LGBTQ+ and CRT curricular bans overlapped. We discuss the implications of policymakers leaning into exclusion over gender reforms.

        <title>Covariational reasoning in Bayesian situations</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous studies on Bayesian situations, in which probabilistic information is used to update the probability of a hypothesis, have often focused on the calculation of a posterior probability. We argue that for an in-depth understanding of Bayesian situations, it is (apart from mere calculation) also necessary to be able to evaluate the effect of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;changes of parameters&lt;/em&gt; in the Bayesian situation and the consequences, e.g., for the posterior probability. Thus, by understanding Bayes’ formula as a function, the concept of covariation is introduced as an extension of conventional Bayesian reasoning, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;covariational reasoning&lt;/em&gt; in Bayesian situations is studied. Prospective teachers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=173) for primary (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=112) and secondary (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;=61) school from two German universities participated in the study and reasoned about covariation in Bayesian situations. In a mixed-methods approach, firstly, the elaborateness of prospective teachers’ covariational reasoning is assessed by analysing the arguments qualitatively, using an adaption of the Structure of Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy. Secondly, the influence of possibly supportive variables on covariational reasoning is analysed quantitatively by checking whether (i) the changed parameter in the Bayesian situation (false-positive rate, true-positive rate or base rate), (ii) the visualisation depicting the Bayesian situation (double-tree vs. unit square) or (iii) the calculation (correct or incorrect) influences the SOLO level. The results show that among these three variables, only the changed parameter seems to influence the covariational reasoning. Implications are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Students’ Mathematical Thinking in Movement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics education research is increasingly focused on how students’ movement interacts with their cognition. Although usually characterized as embodiment research, movement research often theorizes the body in diverse ways. Ingold (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Making: Anthropology, archaeology, art and architecture&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r16&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;) proposes that thinking and knowing emerge from the entwined, dynamic flows of human and non-human materials in a process called making and, following Sheets-Johnstone (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The primacy of movement&lt;/em&gt; (Vol. 82), &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r35&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/span&gt;), contends that humans think in movement. The study that this paper draws on employs Ingold’s making to study students’ movement during mathematical problem solving. In this paper I also recruit Laban’s movement elements (Laban &amp;amp; Ullmann, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r18&quot;&gt;1966&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r18&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/span&gt;) as a framework to describe and analyse how the body moves in space and time and to incorporate the often-forgotten dynamic qualities of movement. This paper investigates the movement of a small group of tertiary students as they engage with a mathematical prompt (a task in Abstract Algebra), using thick description, to answer the questions: (1) How do students think mathematically in movement? (2) How do Laban’s elements help inform research into students’ movement? Through the lens of Laban’s movement elements, my analysis demonstrates that students think mathematically in movement. These findings suggest that mathematics educators may be overlooking valuable instances of students’ mathematical thinking and knowing: the thinking and knowing in movement which may not be available through verbalizations or artefacts. Although thinking in movement does not fit a traditional conceptualization of undergraduate mathematics, which privileges written communication heavily reliant on notation, to understand students’ mathematical cognition more comprehensively, mathematics educators need to reconsider and appreciate students’ mathematical thinking in movement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Competencies and fighting syllabusism</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;For decades, mastery ambitions related to processes like problem-solving, modelling, and reasoning have been incorporated in mathematics curricula around the world. Meanwhile, such ambitions are hindered by syllabusism, a term I use to denote a conviction that results in mastery of a subject being equated with proficiency in a specific subject matter and making that equation the fulcrum of educational processes from teaching to curriculum development. In this article, I argue that using an open two-dimensional structure for curricular content that comprises a set of subject-specific competencies and a modest range of subject matter can help fight syllabusism. I explore and motivate the concept of syllabusism, using the development of a width-depth model of possible curricular ambitions within a given period of time to visualise the detrimental consequences for the attained depth of student learning. In the final part of the article, I illustrate the use of the width-depth model by analysing a specific mathematics curriculum. This analysis leads to two conclusions. Firstly, by highlighting mastery ambitions at the structural level, an open two-dimensional content structure is a powerful means to fight syllabusism. Secondly, using such an approach requires the explicit expression of these mastery ambitions and their conceptualisation independent of the subject matter. In the case of mathematics education, this has taken the form of a set of mathematical competencies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How State Education Leaders Supported Students’ Access to Education Amidst the COVID-19 Crisis: Lessons for Policy</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While recent research provides insights into how district and school leaders responded to the extraordinary disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, less is known about the role of influential state-level education leaders during the crisis. In this paper, we draw on interviews with state leaders to examine their efforts to support students’ access to education during the pandemic. Findings reveal how state leaders engaged in local-level capacity building, advocacy, and collaboration to promote continuity of education. However, their work was complicated by limited capacity at the state level, political tensions, local control, and pervasive stress over time. The paper concludes with implications for policymakers to better prepare for future crises.

        <title>The liberatory stances of Black women mathematics teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Black women teachers have a legacy rooted in resisting and disrupting racism and racialization in schools. Yet, stories of Black women teachers enacting their liberatory pedagogy in mathematics go untold. This study centers Black women mathematics teachers’ liberatory stances towards teaching mathematics to Black, Latinx, and Southeast Asian students. I use a Black feminist lens to conduct a critical narrative study of five Black women elementary teachers that explores how their racialized mathematics experiences informed their liberatory stances of personal accountability, caring, and being a role model for students in their mathematics classrooms. These liberatory stances resisted normalizing whiteness and anti-Blackness in mathematics classrooms within teachers’ schools. Implications include learning about Black women mathematics teachers’ liberatory stances in different racialized social systems as a starting place to transform mathematics education for liberation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Social (justice) mathematics: racializing effects of ordering pedagogies and their inherited regimes of truth</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article examines how making mathematics responsive to perceived differences in students’ real-life needs historically produced racializing distinctions in school mathematics. Decentering social actors and their intentions, we analyze pedagogical techniques in social mathematics courses (1930s–1940s) and social justice mathematics education studies oriented to health and civic participation (1990s–). Despite shifts in ethico-political principles—from enlightening to empowering—racializing effects of these pedagogies persist by projecting relative distances between populations and cultural norms of proper living and well-ordered public life. Juxtaposing past and present, we highlight dangers in how pedagogical interventions to improve malleable differences in children and communities also racialize target groups as yet-to-develop the evidence-based reasoning or mathematical consciousness deemed necessary to attain what are imputed as healthy private and public life. We offer ordering pedagogies as an analytical tool to interrogate practices of racialization and to account for inherited regimes of truth operating in mathematics education by scrutinizing how pedagogical practices produce difference—dividing and ordering students along a hierarchy of perceived needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Logic of Generalization From Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Impact Evaluations</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are viewed as potent tools for generalized causal inference. These reviews are routinely used to inform decision makers about expected effects of interventions. However, the logic of generalization from research reviews to diverse policy and practice contexts is not well developed. Building on sampling theory, concerns about epistemic uncertainty, and principles of generalized causal inference, this article presents a pragmatic approach to generalizability assessment for use with systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This approach is applied to two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of effects of “evidence-based” psychosocial interventions for youth and families. Evaluations included in systematic reviews are not necessarily representative of populations and treatments of interest. Generalizability of results is limited by high risks of bias, uncertain estimates, and insufficient descriptive data from impact evaluations. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be used to test generalizability claims, explore heterogeneity, and identify potential moderators of effects. These reviews can also produce pooled estimates that are not representative of any larger sets of studies, programs, or people. Further work is needed to improve the conduct and reporting of impact evaluations and systematic reviews, and to develop practical approaches to generalizability assessment and guide applications of interventions in diverse policy and practice contexts.

        <title>Multistage Supply Chain Channel Principal-Agent Model in the Context of e-Commerce With Fairness Preference</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This research aims to investigate information asymmetry in e-commerce supply chain channels and the impact of the fair preference model on the behavior and returns of channel members. Therefore, by contrasting it with the model in the completely rational case, this research establishes a more realistic principal-agent model and incorporates the fair preference model into the e-commerce supply chain channel. According to the model’s analysis, the effort level of the retailer at each stage is positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient, and the incentive coefficient of manufacturers is positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient in the case where all rationality is assumed. Manufacturing companies’ anticipated profits are positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient. According to the fair preference model, retailers will put forth more effort to sell products when their fixed income from manufacturers is higher and their optimal effort level is positively correlated with that income. When e-commerce’s efficiency coefficient is higher than 1, the retailer’s revenue and effort exceeded those of traditional channels. Manufacturers and retailers both experience Pareto improvements in their earnings after the fair preference model is introduced.
