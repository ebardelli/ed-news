        <title>Different lenses on distributions and the integration of context knowledge in data-ing processes of primary school students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data-ing&lt;/em&gt;, understood as the verb accompanying the noun data, can describe multiple competencies related to a proficient handling of data and its representations. Previous studies highlight the importance of developing a more holistic perspective on data for young learners as well as the consideration and fruitful integration of context knowledge and statistical information in order to strengthen competences involved while &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;data-ing&lt;/em&gt;. Although both topics are well-researched individually, studies that jointly consider these aspects remain scarce. This study, therefore, reports on findings from an exploratory qualitative study of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;data-ing&lt;/em&gt; processes of 31 German third-grade students (age 9–10) and investigates the lenses on distributions that the young learners adopt as well as the purposes for which they leverage their context knowledge. Additionally, the study further characterizes the integration of the young learners’ context knowledge while &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;data-ing&lt;/em&gt; with regards to the sources of said context knowledge. For analysis, the interviews were videotaped, transcribed and analyzed with qualitative content analysis methods. The exploratory study showed that our young learners predominantly use a classifier view to interpret the distributions of numerical data, often rely on their context knowledge more than on provided data, use their context knowledge mostly to justify a claim and mostly integrate their context knowledge on a local, ego-centric level in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;data-ing&lt;/em&gt; processes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Influence of Earning Industry Certifications on High School Graduation: Evidence from Florida</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Dropping out of high school creates barriers to economic self-sufficiency. Career and technical education (CTE) may help students engage with school by showing the connection between school and work. Prior research has shown that high school CTE participation promotes positive academic outcomes including high school graduation. This paper uses a quasi-experimental design to examine the association between certifications and on-time high school graduation. Our findings indicate that certifications exert a meaningful influence on the likelihood of high school graduation, and that the effect is stronger for students who are at risk for dropping out or are economically disadvantaged.

        <title>Racial Disparities in School Poverty and Spending: Examining Allocations Within Metropolitan Areas</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Racially segregated schools influence the distribution of educational opportunity. When students of different races enroll in separate schools, systematic differences in access to school resources and exposure to high levels of student need can emerge. Using recently available national school-level finance data, we find that typical Black and Hispanic students attend schools with higher per-pupil spending but also higher proportions of low-income students and English learners than typical White students living in the same metropolitan area. Drawing on estimates of the additional spending required to provide high-need students with equal educational opportunities, we find that cost-adjusted spending in the average Black and Hispanic students’ schools ranges from zero to 17.2% less than that in the average White students’ schools. Racial disparities in cost-adjusted spending are larger in the largest metropolitan areas and in the Northeast, indicating that many Black and Hispanic students are disadvantaged by these inequities.

        <title>Academic Cheating, Achievement Orientations, and Culture Values: A Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This preregistered meta-analysis investigated whether cultural values moderate the relations between students’ achievement orientations and their tendency to cheat. We identified 80 studies on the associations between performance/learning orientations and academic cheating in 27 countries with 40,867 participants. Performance orientation positively correlates with academic cheating (r = .09, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.13), and learning orientation negatively correlates with academic cheating (r = −.16, 95% CI = −0.20 to –0.13). Univariate meta-analysis, hierarchical meta-regression, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) revealed that cultural values at the country level significantly moderate the relations between achievement orientations and cheating. These findings suggested that cultural values play a significant role in influencing the relations between achievement orientations and academic cheating, and, thus, cheating prevention programs must consider culture to achieve optimal effects. Based on these findings, we propose a new model that integrates cultural values into the existing model of academic cheating decision-making.

        <title>Admissions, Organization, Culture, and Policy: Understanding the Postsecondary Structures that Shape Women’s Entry into Computing Bachelor’s Programs</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Despite the growing popularity of computing bachelor’s programs, women remain vastly underrepresented in these fields. Using Social Cognitive Career Theory and intersectionality as guiding theories, this qualitative study explores how postsecondary institutions shape women’s experiences choosing and entering computing bachelor’s programs. Twenty-eight of 40 participants entered their institutions with plans to study computing, while 12 developed a new (or renewed) interest in computing as postsecondary students. Findings outline four postsecondary structures that shaped women’s entry into computing majors, including university-level admissions and participant perceptions of financial and cultural accessibility; academic college-level organization and admissions processes; institutional computing cultures, namely introductory course experiences and social environments; and major declaration policies. Findings also show how these structures differentially shaped participant experiences based on intersecting social identities. Overall, findings illustrate the precarious relationship between computing interest development, major intent, and major enrollment for undergraduate women in computing.

        <title>Learning to speak mathematically at the Japanese supplementary school in Sweden: critical cases of praxeological anomaly</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Natural language is known to play a crucial and specific role for children’s learning in school mathematics. Not only does it carry special vocabulary, but subtle differences between natural languages may lead to surprising challenges, for instance, for learners who are not taught mathematics in their mother tongue. In this paper, the anthropological theory of didactic (ATD) is used as a main framework, and we analyse some praxeological anomalies from the teaching of fractions at Japanese schools abroad, while learners attend, at the same time, a regular school in some other language (in this case, the local language, Swedish). Our findings indicate that these praxeological anomalies arise not only from linguistic disparities related to specialised vocabulary and syntax for elementary mathematics but also from institutional and curricular differences. This study gives new insights on these language challenges related to mathematics as taught at expatriate schools, particularly in the case of Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A “Wise” Intervention to Increase Hand Hygiene Compliance of Nurses in Acute Care Units in US Hospitals: A Multiple Baseline Interrupted Time-Series Evaluation</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Objective: This study tested a ‘wise’ intervention (quick prompt of a specific psychological mec) in acute care hospital units to improve nurses’ hand hygiene compliance (HHC). Design: A multiple baseline design in two medical-surgical teaching hospitals in the United States. Measurements: Hand hygiene data was collected using an electronic compliance monitoring system with sensors placed in doorways and on corresponding soap and alcohol-based hand rub dispensers. The outcome measure was the proportion of opportunities in which HH was undertaken by staff per week in each unit. Intervention: A quick-and-easy psychological prime to reinvigorate professional identity. Methods: Interrupted time series analysis using a quasi-Poisson regression model with statistical process control charts for each unit. Results: A statistically significant increase in HHC rates that was sustained for months post-intervention. However, the patterns by unit were not statistically significant once temporal trends were considered. Other factors, such as the unit type and the use of incentives could have impacted the results. Conclusions: These analyses suggest that the aggregate impact should not be taken as evidence of intervention effectiveness. This study therefore cannot be considered to have provided a strong foundation for use of a ‘wise’ intervention, despite its relatively small financial, logistical and psychological cost.

        <title>Estimating the Impact of Integrated Student Support on Elementary School Achievement: A Natural Experiment</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;National interest is growing in Integrated Student Support (ISS) interventions, which offer schools systematic ways to reduce barriers to learning. The present study exploits the random component embedded within the school assignment system of a large urban school district to estimate the effect of schools providing ISS on student academic achievement at third, fourth, and fifth grade. The sample included students (N = 2,342) randomly assigned to schools—with or without ISS—via enrollment lottery. Students assigned to schools implementing ISS demonstrated higher achievement (from approximately .02% to more than 50% of a standard deviation) than those assigned to control schools. While we found some evidence for the efficacy of ISS by third grade, treatment effects were consistently largest and proved most robust across modeling strategies at fifth grade. The practical significance of these findings is discussed with attention to ongoing national efforts to improve the learning opportunities of economically disadvantaged students.

        <title>Mental constructions for the learning of the concept of vector space</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study contributes to the literature on linear algebra instruction by designing and researching a teaching sequence based on APOS Theory to introduce engineering students to vector spaces. The sequence offers students multiple opportunities to understand the concept. Another contribution is the evidence that introducing prerequisite concepts—such as equality, sets, and binary operations—before tackling vector space was crucial for grasping the role of proof in determining whether a set is a vector space. The findings confirm that, as other studies have shown, vector space is challenging for students. However, the results demonstrate that students were able to face this challenge. All students showed evidence of developing an understanding of the concept, with nine achieving a clear grasp of vector space and the role of proof by the end of the experience. Additionally, the progress observed—from having difficulties with symbols to successfully proving statements involving unconventional operations—underscores the effectiveness of the teaching approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Secondary school students’ strategies when interpreting histograms and case-value plots: an eye-tracking study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Many students persistently misinterpret histograms. This calls for closer inspection of students’ strategies when interpreting histograms and case-value plots (which look similar but are different). Using students’ gaze data, we ask: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;How and how well do upper secondary pre-university school students estimate and compare arithmetic means of histograms and case-value plots?&lt;/em&gt; We designed four item types: two requiring mean estimation and two requiring means comparison. Analysis of gaze data of 50 students (15–19 years old) solving these items was triangulated with data from cued recall. We found five strategies. Two hypothesized most common strategies for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;estimating&lt;/em&gt; means were confirmed: a strategy associated with horizontal gazes and a strategy associated with vertical gazes. A third, new, count-and-compute strategy was found. Two more strategies emerged for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;comparing&lt;/em&gt; means that take specific features of the distribution into account. In about half of the histogram tasks, students used correct strategies. Surprisingly, when comparing two case-value plots, some students used distribution features that are only relevant for histograms, such as symmetry. As several incorrect strategies related to how and where the data and the distribution of these data are depicted in histograms, future interventions should aim at supporting students in understanding these concepts in histograms. A methodological advantage of eye-tracking data collection is that it reveals more details about students’ problem-solving processes than thinking-aloud protocols. We speculate that spatial gaze data can be re-used to substantiate ideas about the sensorimotor origin of learning mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Do Teachers With Absent Students Feel Less Job Satisfaction?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Research and policy have focused predominantly on the individual consequences for students who miss school. Yet absenteeism does not occur in a vacuum, and less work has focused on how student absenteeism correlates to classroom dynamics. Practically no attention has been paid toward teachers. We propose in this study that student absences make it challenging for teachers to enjoy the very function of their jobs and thus experience more dissatisfaction at work as a result. We find that teachers have lower job satisfaction when more of their students are absent. However, we find statistically significant differences only for broad aspects of teacher satisfaction—job enjoyment, usefulness, and belief in the profession—rather than differences among other related measures of teaching.

        <title>Learning to leverage teachers’ ideas: facilitators’ growth in moderation practices with simultaneously strong goal focus and participant focus</title>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When novice facilitators start to lead teachers’ professional development (PD), they have been found to struggle to combine a strong participant focus (i.e., valuing and working with participating teachers’ needs and ideas) and goal focus (working toward the PD goals), whereas expert facilitators seem to be more able to integrate both focus. Empirical studies have identified these challenges across contexts and several situational demands, for example, when facilitators set goals, plan a PD activity, notice teachers’ ideas, and moderate video-based discussions. In this paper, we contribute to this line of research by investigating another situational demand in a longitudinal perspective: We studied how two novice facilitators moderated the discussion after the same PD activity several times. The qualitative comparative analysis of transcribed videos from PD sessions revealed that each facilitator used several practices with varying degrees of goal and participant focus. Over time, they learned to apply more practices that were, simultaneously, strongly goal and participant focused: By leveraging teachers’ ideas toward the PD content goals, they achieved integration of both focus, which have sometimes previously been experienced as conflicting. We discuss implications for facilitator preparation programs in terms of unpacking facilitation practices and explicitly working with the content elements for finer-grained goals.&lt;/p&gt;
