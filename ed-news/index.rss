        <title>“Everybody’s talking about doing co-design, but to really truly genuinely authentically do it […] it’s bloody hard”: Radical openness in youth participatory action research</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Guided by the work of bell hooks, this study uses her concept of ‘radical openness’ as an innovation for multi-party facilitation teams negotiating different roles, positionalities and understandings of youth participatory action research (YPAR). We explore the challenges we negotiated as facilitators in YPAR as they materialised in weekly reflections. We write as a team of two project leaders, three researchers and a project manager. Data comprised recordings of collaborative meetings, weekly reflections and focus groups. Two themes captured the challenges that we experienced and reflexively negotiated. First, we uncovered our own biases and assumptions through critical reflection and dialogue between comrades. Second, as a facilitation team we were able to negotiate authenticity and accountability in relation to project governance and reporting. Radical openness enabled us to identify and mitigate power relations as a team, collectively deepening our consciousness and research praxis. We all proved willing to acknowledge what we each did not know and use our imaginations to see things from each other’s perspectives. Based on our experiences, we suggest that multi-party facilitation teams consider how radical openness can help to cultivate spaces of dialogue between comrades to disrupt hegemonic and colonised views in YPAR.

        <title>Teachers and School Leaders’ Readiness for Parental Engagement: Critical Policy Analysis of Canadian Standards</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teacher readiness for parental engagement is a vital competence in the context of increased emphasis on engaging parents in K–12 schools. The rise in the standards movement in education led to the inclusion of parental engagement in teacher standards. Here, critical policy analysis of teacher standards shows how teachers’ and school leaders’ readiness for parental engagement is addressed in Canadian policy documents. Teacher readiness is conceptualized as the ability to establish relationships, support communication, and build partnerships with parents and families. Current policy provisions support teachers’ capacity for parental engagement by introducing the asset-based approach to engagement and acknowledging the diversity among parents. Nevertheless, teacher standards fail to distinguish between parental involvement in schooling and parental engagement in education/learning and remain silent on the role of social inequality in parental engagement. Implications for new teacher standards include centering parental engagement on parents and families and tackling inequality in parental engagement.

        <title>Forced to Choose: Lessons Learned from Families of Students Within Special Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this interview study, we utilize a theoretical framework that combines Bell’s theory of choice sets with DisCrit to explore how parents of students with IEPs (SIEPs) experienced a forced school choice embedded with the 2013 mass school closures in Chicago. We find that a child’s disability was a primary factor in parent’s choices. Further, all parents in our sample had conceptions of ideal schools, but a child’s IEP and other barriers—including safety and transportation—could prevent parents from enrolling their child in an otherwise desired school. In this way a child’s IEP could provide access to needed services while also denying families from desired learning environments. These findings point to the ableist nature of school choice and contribute to the growing body of research that questions the theoretical underpinnings of school choice as an education reform strategy.

        <title>Unpacking Legal Advancements for Asian American Students: A Political Discourse Analysis of Illinois’s House Bill 376</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In 2021, Illinois became the first state in the United States to require that K-12 students learn about Asian American history. Illinois achieved this when lawmakers passed House Bill 376 (H.B. 376), colloquially known as the Teaching Equitable Asian American Community History (TEAACH) Act. H.B. 376 received praise for being the first legislation of its kind, and its passage inspired similar bills in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Given the bill’s influence, it is imperative to consider its language and utility. This critical policy analysis specifically investigates lawmakers’ employment of the term “Asian American.” The analysis ultimately argues that H.B. 376 is a necessary first step in breaking centuries of silence and dislocation for Asian Americans; however, the bill advances a social definition—or sociopolitical understanding—of “Asian American” that is potentially harmful.

        <title>Developing the concept of task substitution and transformation by defining own equivalences</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The presented article is dedicated to a new way of teaching substitution in algebra. In order to effectively master the subject matter, it is necessary for students to perceive the equal sign equivalently, to learn to manipulate expressions as objects, and to perceive and use transformations based on defining their own equivalences. According to the results of several researches, these changes do not occur automatically, and the neglect of their development leads to students’ insufficient adoption of substitution. The submitted contribution presents a new way of teaching substitution, the stages of which support the gradual development of the necessary competences of students, so that substitution becomes part of their computing apparatus. The effectiveness of the mentioned method of teaching substitution was also verified experimentally. By conducting a pedagogical experiment, it was confirmed that the application of the substitution teaching method developed by us led to more frequent use of substitution by students from the experimental group (47 students) compared to students from the control group (82 students) who learned substitution in the usual way. It emerged from the interview with experimental group students that they considered the proposed method suitable and that it encouraged them to learn substitution in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons in paradise: envisioning a Black liberatory mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I use Toni Morrison’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Paradise&lt;/em&gt; as a backdrop for framing a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Black Liberatory Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; (Martin et al., &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r34&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;) that is rooted in what Dumas and ross (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Urban Education&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;51&lt;/em&gt;(4):415-442, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r16&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;) have conceptualized as BlackCrit. The goal of the current undertaking is to evaluate anecdotes of this working idea of paradise, to merge it with more refined ones, and to dream even bigger about what paradise could look like for Black students in mathematics spaces. It is with this backdrop that I proffer how to fashion a Black liberatory mathematics education (BLiME), my conception of paradise, where Black students are expected to exist in their full humanity. I offer up five characteristics that inform the BLiME framework and are an extension of Morrison’s (&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r40&quot;&gt;2019&lt;/span&gt;) writings on paradise: beauty, plenty, rest, exclusivity, and eternity. I contend that Ruby, Morrison’s town in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Paradise,&lt;/em&gt; had elements of these characteristics, but here, BLiME reimagines mathematics education as a full embodiment of what Ruby had the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; to be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Contextualized High School Performance: Evidence to Inform Equitable Holistic, Test-Optional, and Test-Free Admissions Policies</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Holistic admissions practices require evaluating an applicant’s credentials in light of the opportunities available in their high school context. High school grades, test scores, and course taking are clearly related to college grades, retention, and graduation. But does performance in high school context also relate to college success? Building a unique dataset of 2.3 million students in a Midwestern state, we find that contextualized indicators of high school grades and standardized tests are strongly associated with student success in college, validating their use in holistic admissions. Contextualized grades have a stronger and more consistent association with college success than contextualized test scores, and may be most helpful at test-optional, test-free, and broader-access colleges that have yet to adopt holistic admissions practices.

        <title>Is theoretical topic-specific research “old fashioned”? An epistemological inquiry about the ontological creativity of Mathematics Education Research</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In Mathematics Education (ME), research dealing with topic-specific (TS) issues (e.g., what levels of development exist in learning fractions) produces usually local results and is considered less fashionable and attractive for innovative research projects than research dealing with context-specific (CS) issues that have more general and abstract scopes (e.g., what is mathematical instruction? what is the field of ME?) and produces middle-range or grand theories. TS- and CS-research run along separate tracks with little or no crossover, at least from the beginning of the socio-political-turn in ME, but connecting them could help to single out hidden variables in CS-research. This paper shows that TS-research creates specific mathematical objects that allow us to reduce the distance between these two lines of research. Mathematical objects specific to ME research are shown to be both a technical link between the two lines of research because they allow topic-specificity to access more abstract and general realms of research, as well as factor at stake when aspects related to the social, political, and ethical implications of the ontological creativity of TS-research are discussed in a critical postmodern approach. Discussing its impact on textbooks, teacher-training, teaching practices, further TS-research-practices, as well as on the researcher’s epistemological empowerment and on the self-referentiality of ME research, TS-research moves from the periphery to the heart of CS-research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>World Bank Influence on Policy Formation in Education: A Systematic Review of the Literature</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The World Bank has been called the most influential organization in education reform globally. Not only is it the single largest funder of education for international development, but it also produces knowledge, circulates discourse, and structures policymaking processes in ways that extend its influence far beyond its primary role as a bank. However, while much literature has been produced about the World Bank, the field of education lacks a systematic discussion of what has been reported about how the World Bank influences policy formation at the country level. Through the conduct of a theoretically informed systematic literature review of 70 publications, this article clarifies and provides examples for the numerous ways that the World Bank influences policy formation. In all, the article documents 11 pathways through which the World Bank influences policymaking. The article concludes by suggesting areas where research on the World Bank can be improved, namely, through more explicit attention to the theoretical and methodological approaches employed. The goal of this review is to encourage scholars to be more specific in their conceptualizations and discussions of World Bank influence, to go beyond general claims of policy imposition or agenda shaping.

        <title>Interpolation and extrapolation in Year 5 STEM activities: exploring data about viscosity without advanced statistics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Incorporating an evidence-based approach in STEM education using data collection and analysis strategies when learning about science concepts enhances primary students’ discipline knowledge and cognitive development. This paper reports on learning activities that use the nature of viscosity and the power of informal statistical inference to build students’ conceptual understanding of interpolation and extrapolation without imposing on them the demands of understanding the nonlinear mathematics used to explore the concepts at the tertiary level. An exploratory research strategy was adopted to investigate the way in which Year 5 students created and analysed graphical representations from data collected when performing viscosity experiments. The data representations produced by the students and their subsequent predictions were analysed using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) model as adapted specifically for graphical representations. The results illustrate that when provided with appropriate technological tools to scaffold student learning, in this case &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TinkerPlots&lt;/em&gt;™, development of students’ appreciation of interpolation and extrapolation within meaningful data contexts across the STEM curriculum does not have to wait until the tertiary level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Instructor perspectives on quantitative reasoning for critical citizenship</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A tertiary course in Quantitative Reasoning (QR) has the potential to develop key practical and intellectual skills for citizenship, such as critical thinking, problem solving, quantitative literacy, and oral and written communication. In this article, we present research conducted on four instructors of such a QR course for students enrolled in a wide variety of nonscience degree programs at a university in the United States. The course used a student-inquiry approach to proportional reasoning, probability, statistical reasoning, and mathematical modeling. The findings are framed by a 5 C model of QR, which entails &lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ritical thinking to link real-world &lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ontexts to mathematical &lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;oncepts supported by student &lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ollaboration and QR &lt;strong class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ompetencies. The research addressed the questions of how university instructors support student development of the skills needed for critical citizenship and how this support relates to the 5 C model. We found that three of the four instructors viewed critical thinking as a central goal of the QR course and as supporting citizenship education. All four engaged students in tasks designed to develop a combination of skills associated citizenship, including critical thinking, self-questioning, collaboration, and communication. The discussion addresses such issues as the course’s merits and challenges, student engagement, the relative importance of the five Cs, the importance of instructional autonomy, and recommendations for related professional development and future research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rest in Peace, Journal of the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ Society</title>

            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Armed with half a decade of experience as editor of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;vinculum&lt;/em&gt;, 4 years of writing the regular column “Math Ed Matters by MatthewMaddux” for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Variable&lt;/em&gt;, and as lead editor of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Selected Writings from the Journal of the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ Society&lt;/em&gt;, I can safely say that the reports of the death of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ Society&lt;/em&gt; (SMTS) have been greatly exaggerated — until now. I mean, sure, with all due respect, and as a member of the executive of the SMTS myself, the journal kind of carries on as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;the subscript&lt;/em&gt;, which is a series of links compiled by the SMTS executive. Looked at from an old-man-yells-at-cloud perspective, emailing a few links out is a far cry from the mountain of material found printed in the many, many pages of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of the SMTS&lt;/em&gt;, differently named as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Mathematics Newsletter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The SMTS Newsletter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SMTS Journal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of the SMTS&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;vinculum&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Variable&lt;/em&gt; over the past 60 years. I should know, after all, I led an extensive excavation of math teacher journal materials here in Western Canada. This article, then, is a quasi-autopsy of the journal. Rest in Peace, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of the SMTS&lt;/em&gt;. You deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, a team of teacher educators collectively think through the many possibilities of how concepts such as decolonization, abolition, and fugitivity intersect with and are taken up by teacher education programs. To do so, we undertook a critical interpretive synthesis of scholarly literature spanning 2000 to 2020 to locate, examine, and organize existing examples of teacher education programs that work to transgress hegemonic colonial models of education. We revisit de Oliveira Andreotti et al.’s social cartography as a framework for comparing the theoretical foundations and social implications of each teacher education program.

        <title>Research on gender and mathematics: exploring new and future directions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This narrative review of current research on gender and mathematics covers the years 2020 to 2022. The number of exemplary publications within these 3 years and the diversity of topics, theoretical frameworks, subjects, and authors are indications of gender and mathematics remaining a robust and evolving area of study. Of particular interest are studies of lived experiences of students in secondary school and university programs, many of which featured continuing and troubling discriminatory incidents. In addition, the focus in several studies on the intersectionality of gender with race and other identity features is a commendable trend that should be continued. Similar to the transition from sex differences to gender differences that emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, in the papers examined, some authors have reconceptualized gender as a fluid, non-binary construct, although most gender data are reported in binary ways. Gender remains a focus of research in mathematics education because of persistent inequities in achievement, attitudes, representation, and lived experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weaving together the threads of Indigenous knowledge and mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As in many countries, for decades in Aotearoa (New Zealand), we have heard the story of the Pacific and Māori achievement gap in mathematics. This has become a widely accepted part of beliefs constructed across multiple communities about students and schools and who can do and learn mathematics successfully. A common response by policy makers and educators alike is to fix the problem of those deemed academically bleak by putting in place a range of interventions. In this article, we challenge the positioning of Pacific students as a problem to be fixed and instead focus on how we can address the practices inherent in historical forms of institutionalised racism related to colonisation. We use an Indigenous research model—Tivaevae—to develop an exemplary case study of the teachers and students from one low socio-economic urban school as they were involved in conscientisation and the reconstitution of educational practices to privilege indigenous knowledge systems. The findings highlight one model of how teachers and students can change institutionalised Western world practices in the mathematics classroom. We argue that the shift to honouring indigenous knowledge systems and a strength-based approach provided opportunities for Pacific students to learn mathematics in ways that supported them to build strong mathematical dispositions, and rather than being assimilated, retain their cultural identity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Competency Based Education Pilot in Illinois: Preliminary Findings</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this study we employed regression analysis and between-group matched pair design to analyze whether participation in a competency-based education pilot was associated with improved high school completion and postsecondary entry. Data were obtained for high schools participating in a CBE pilot program in Illinois. Results of the matched pair design showed that CBE participation was significantly associated with higher rates of high school graduation for seniors across all groups with differences significant overall (97.2% for CBE vs. 93.1% for non-CBE), for White students (97.2% vs. 92.7%), and for students eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (96.3% vs. 90.3%). Graduation rate for seniors was also higher for African American students and for Hispanic-Latinx students, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the matched pair design, CBE participation was not significantly associated with entry into college within 12 months of high school.
