        <title>The Emergence and Escalation of Online Racial Discrimination in Digital Spaces: A Systematic Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;COVID-19 required educators and students to rapidly move to online learning. Simultaneously, while navigating the pandemic in lockdown, citizens were exposed to the brutal murder of George Floyd. The increased exposure to online activity and discrimination generated a hyperawareness of the potential link between the two. Our interest was to examine that linkage as we considered the prevalence and escalation of online racial discrimination (ORD) as a student phenomenon. Filtering for adolescent and young adult students, this systematic review ultimately employed 21 articles. Our results reflect that ORD as defined, changed over time, as did the ways it manifested. Importantly, the impacts of ORD on student learning and well-being were revealed. This review further indicates that the expansion of online instruction created a complex intersection between online social interactions and academic outcomes ripe for vigilance. Our work adds to the ORD literature while informing future education researchers, educators, and stakeholders of its harmful impacts.

        <title>Measuring the Interdisciplinarity and Collaboration Perceptions of U.S. Scientists, Engineers, and Educators</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinarity has the potential to lead to more innovation and advances in knowledge than are possible from a single discipline. Yet, little is known about interdisciplinary collaborations and the perceptions of those involved. This quantitative study investigated the perceptions of U.S. faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students involved in education and science/engineering collaborations. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted for two modified scales, Collaboration Perceptions (CP; n = 117; 17 items; α = .923) and Interdisciplinarity Perceptions (IP; n = 119; 11 items; α = .852). Participants’ perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity were strongly positive and did not significantly differ based on demographic factors (e.g., gender, discipline, role). Perceptions were influenced by collectivist orientation; the high collectivism group had significantly more positive perceptions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity, and collectivist orientation was positively and significantly correlated with CP and IP scores. Implications and recommendations for interdisciplinary collaborations will be discussed.

        <title>Differential effects of private tutoring on groups of students’ mathematics achievements: a longitudinal study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Supplementary private tutoring (PT) is commonly implemented worldwide, particularly among countries with highly competitive school systems and high-stakes examinations. Families often consider PT to promote their children’s skills and address any gaps in children’s learning. However, PT generally requires a considerable amount of family resources, and whether PT effectively increases students’ academic achievement remains subject of debate. This study examined student-report questionnaires and school reports of mathematics achievement from approximately 1500 secondary school students in China to track retrospective longitudinal variations of PT over a year. The study involved an analysis of the differential effectiveness of regular mathematics PT participation on the mathematics achievement of students from different quantiles at four hierarchical cognitive levels. The results indicated that only the lower-quantile students benefited from PT for their lower cognitive level achievement. Further, it was observed that among the higher-quantile students there was a reduction in high cognitive level achievement. These results raise questions concerning the role and effectiveness of PT. This study provides an evidence-based assessment of the effectiveness of PT and highlights the implications for educational practice and future research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Effects and Local Implementation of School Finance Reforms on Teacher Salary, Hiring, and Turnover</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Knowing how policy-induced salary schedule changes affect teacher recruitment and retention will significantly advance our understanding of how resources matter for K–12 student learning. This study sheds light on this issue by estimating how legislative funding changes in Washington state in 2018–2019—induced by the McCleary court-ordered reform—affected teacher salaries and labor market outcomes. By embedding a simulated instrumental variables approach in a mixed-methods design, we observed that local collective bargaining negotiations directed new state funding allocations to substantially increase certificated base salaries, particularly for senior teachers with 16 years or more of teaching experience. Variability in political power, priorities, and interests of both districts and unions led to greater heterogeneity in teacher salary schedules. Suggestive evidence shows that state average teacher turnover rate was significantly reduced in the first year of reform. The McCleary-induced salary increase particularly reduces mid-career teachers’ (8–15 years of teaching experience) mobility rate and late-career teachers’ (23+ years of teaching experience) leaving rate. The McCleary-induced base salary increase has mostly null effects on teacher hiring in the first 2 years of implementation.

        <title>Analyse didactique d’une reprise d’étude de la multiplication de deux nombres entiers dans un suivi orthophonique en France</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In France, when a student has persistent and recurring difficulties in mathematics, he or she may be cared for by a healthcare professional, a speech-therapist, outside of school. The social security reimbursed this support. Our research aims to objectify the effects of such monitoring on school learning. This article presents seven sessions on the theme of multiplying two integers of a speech therapy follow-up for a 10 to 11-year-old child. The didactic analysis of this sequence, based on a naturalistic observation, without intervention of researchers, is carried out to answer the question: what is the mathematical knowledge worked? Our study highlights a networking of different types of tasks, potentially due to a work of reversibility (Apostel et al. in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Logique et équilibre,&lt;/em&gt; Presses Universitaires de Francein, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r1&quot;&gt;1957&lt;/span&gt;) and the epistemic role of the material, omnipresent during the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
