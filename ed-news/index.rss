        <title>The Effects of Virtual Tutoring on Young Readers: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In-person tutoring has been shown to improve academic achievement. Fewer studies have examined the impact of virtual tutoring and have focused on older students. We present findings from the first randomized controlled trial of virtual tutoring for young children. Students in grades K–2 were assigned to 1:1 tutoring, 2:1 tutoring, or a control group. Virtual tutoring increased early literacy skills by 0.05-SD for all students and 0.08-SD for a sample excluding English learners and students with disabilities (i.e., students not eligible for additional support services). One-on-one tutoring tended to produce larger gains, especially for students initially scoring well below benchmark (0.15-SD). Effects are smaller than typically seen from in-person early literacy tutoring programs but still positive and statistically significant.

        <title>Weeks After the Raid: The Immediate and Sustained Changes in Student Attendance Rates Following Immigration Arrests</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Recent research has shown the ways in which immigration enforcement actions can affect educational outcomes for all students, regardless of their immigrant status. One consequence of particular concern is student absenteeism, a non-academic indicator used by 37 states to evaluate school success under the Every Student Succeeds Act. However, previous research has faced data limitations on the measure of immigration enforcement and relies on aggregated measures of educational outcomes. Using weekly attendance rates of a school district as well as unique data collection on immigration arrests between 2014 and 2018, this study used single and comparative interrupted time series analyses to quantify the immediate and sustained impacts of immigration arrests on student attendance. Findings suggest that incidents involving a greater number of immigration arrests correspond to immediate spikes in student absenteeism, as high as 11% points for certain student demographics. Additionally, the district’s attendance rate sustained a cumulative 2%-point decline following two incidents involving the greatest number of arrests. Implications for policymakers and educators are discussed.

        <title>Assessing Atlanta’s Placed-Based College Scholarship</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;We investigate whether and how Achieve Atlanta’s college scholarship and associated services impact college enrollment, persistence, and graduation among Atlanta Public School graduates experiencing low household income. Qualifying for the scholarship of up to $5,000 per year does not meaningfully change college enrollment among those near the high school GPA eligibility thresholds. However, scholarship receipt does have large and statistically significant effects on early college persistence (i.e., 14%) that continue through BA degree completion within 4 years (22%), although scholarship receipt does not impact graduation from 2-year colleges. We discuss how the selection criteria and processes of place-based programs intended for those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds may influence results for different types of students.

        <title>Workplace Inclusion in Academia: The Relationship between Diversity Climate and Engineering Faculty Turnover Intentions</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between engineering faculties’ perception of the diversity climate and their turnover intentions at R1 (Research 1) universities across the U.S. We sampled 1,101 tenure-track engineering faculty for this purpose. Data analysis showed that an engineering faculty’s demographic characteristics (i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, professor rank, age, engineering areas, marriage status, and tenure-track status) are associated with their perceptions of the diversity climate. Furthermore, results from structural equation modeling analyses show that faculty with higher perceptions of organizational fairness and inclusion reported a lower desire to turn over. Implications for the results are discussed.

        <title>Tracking Procedures and Criteria and the SES Bias in Teacher Track Recommendations</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The allocation of students to ability tracks is often based on teacher recommendations. These recommendations tend to be biased in favor of students from higher socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. While tracking procedures and criteria have been proposed to play a role herein, empirical research is lacking. Using a survey experiment and information from 221 teachers in 69 Dutch schools, I find that teachers in the same school vary in their interpretation of their school’s procedure and (relatedly) their own tracking criteria. Teachers who perceive the school procedure to put more weight on students’ home environment, and/or (relatedly) put more weight on this themselves, show a stronger SES bias in track recommendations in the survey experiment.

        <title>Inclusive Strategies for Children With Developmental Disabilities in Mainstream Classrooms in African Countries: A Systematic Review of Stakeholder Experiences, Attitudes, and Perspectives</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;African children with developmental disabilities (DD), including autism and intellectual disability, are often excluded from mainstream schools. We systematically reviewed 28 qualitative studies conducted in Africa, aiming to synthesize stakeholders’ perspectives on inclusive teaching strategies for supporting children with DD in mainstream classes. Six interrelated themes were developed using thematic analysis. Teachers strived to meet learners’ needs through teaching and task adaptations (Theme 1) and provide targeted support, reinforcement, and feedback (Theme 2). Teachers’ inclusive pedagogies, while sometimes creating divisions, often reflected a whole-class approach (Theme 3), especially in promoting inclusive environments (Theme 4) and engaging teaching (Theme 5). Authors of reviewed studies often discussed how teachers’ strategies fit in with the evidence base (Theme 6). While teachers’ inclusion efforts appeared progressive, they were mostly based on Western pedagogies and challenged by limited resources and training. Training efforts based on indigenous pedagogies could improve use and outcomes of inclusive strategies.

        <title>The Rise and Fall of the Teaching Profession: Prestige, Interest, Preparation, and Satisfaction Over the Last Half Century</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We examine the state of the U.S. K–12 teaching profession over the last half century by compiling nationally representative time-series data on four interrelated constructs: occupational prestige, interest among students, the number of individuals preparing for entry, and on-the-job satisfaction. We find a consistent and dynamic pattern across every measure: a rapid decline in the 1970s, a swift rise in the 1980s extending into the mid-1990s, relative stability, and then a sustained decline beginning around 2010. The current state of the teaching profession is at or near its lowest levels in 50 years. We identify and explore a range of hypotheses that might explain these historical patterns including economic and sociopolitical factors, education policies, and school environments.

        <title>Need-Based Promise Programs, Performance Funding Bonuses, and the Enrollment of Low-Income Students</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Certain statewide promise programs require students to demonstrate financial need, while state performance funding policies sometimes incorporate a financial bonus that incentivizes colleges to enroll or graduate low-income students. We use data on public, 4-year colleges from 2007–2008 to 2019–2020, and incorporate difference-in-differences analyses and event studies. We find that colleges affected by promise programs in Louisiana, New York, and Washington observed no changes to the number and percent of first-time, full-time (FTFT) Pell grant recipients. Colleges in states subject to a performance funding bonus experienced no changes to the number and percent of FTFT Pell grants recipients, and colleges in Louisiana subject to both policies experienced no changes to either outcome.

        <title>Attendance Practices in High-Absenteeism Districts</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Though researchers have documented the consequences and causes of chronic absenteeism, there is limited empirical evidence about what schools and districts are actually doing to improve attendance. This study presents evidence about the types of attendance practices that forty-seven high-absenteeism districts in Michigan are planning and implementing, using data from principal surveys, case studies, observations, and school improvement plans. In 2022-2023, principals reported using communication practices, incentives, and to an extent providing resources to address barriers to attendance. In improvement plans, districts planned to create new organizational infrastructure and hire new personnel, with less emphasis on specific practices. These findings highlight frequent use of communication-based strategies and limited existing organizational infrastructure for addressing attendance. It is unclear whether planned practices will address social and economic inequalities at the root of high absenteeism rates. I conclude with recommendations for monitoring new attendance practices, addressing root causes, and avoiding counterproductive practices.

        <title>Under the Law: Virtually an education</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/3&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-53, November 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The closure of school buildings during the pandemic made virtual instruction necessary. Since schools have reopened, its use has become more normalized than it was pre-COVID. Bob Kim discusses some of the civil rights issues education leaders and policy makers must consider if they choose to assign certain students to virtual instruction. Some students, particularly students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English learners, may have difficulty accessing virtual instruction or receiving the full benefit of instruction when it is delivered virtually.

Students planted the seeds and tended the plants. They kept journals about the growing plants and worked together to solve problems when they arose. The produce from the garden is served in the school cafeteria. Wang writes that the students value being out in nature and learning through activities rather than just in their classrooms.

        <title>Backtalk: Where are the teachers of color? Getting cut out and lured away</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/3&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, November 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Research has shown that having a diverse teacher workforce benefits students, but the population of teachers remains predominantly white, even as the student population becomes increasingly diverse. Andrew Kwok and Brendan Bartanen analyzed data from college applications in Texas and found that interest in teacher certification has declined in the past decade more than interest in other professions. Promisingly, the racial makeup of college applicants interested in teaching is relatively diverse. However, at every stage in the process toward becoming a teacher, the diversity decreases. They recommend that education leaders and schools of education make intentional efforts to reach out to students of color early about the possibility of becoming a teacher.

        <title>Employing School Librarians: What Decision-Makers Tell Us</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/3&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-46, November 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Although research has shown that having a school librarian benefits students, librarian positions are being cut in schools across the U.S. SLIDE — The School Librarian Investigation: Decline or Evolution? — examined federal data on school library staffing and interviewed 49 district leaders about their decisions to eliminate or add librarian positions. Keith Curry Lance, Debra E. Kachel, and Caitlin Gerrity report that of 54 total decisions leaders made related to changes in librarian staffing, 28 resulted in librarian increases and 26 resulted in librarian decreases. Decisions to add or eliminate positions were generally related to changes in district priorities. Although leaders expressed that they value librarians’ role in providing information literacy instruction and support and had positive experiences with librarians, some had to allocate resources to other positions. Others had trouble finding librarians with the necessary qualifications. When making staffing decisions, leaders need to consider what benefits librarians offer and how to meet student and staff needs for information and media literacy.
