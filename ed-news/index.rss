        <title>Distinguishing Subtypes of Self-Efficacy Among Secondary School Teachers: A Latent Profile Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teacher self-efficacy is a crucial factor in teaching and learning, yet there is limited understanding of its heterogeneity among the Asian population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (a) identify different self-efficacy patterns among 3,095 Singaporean lower secondary school teachers, (b) investigate potential variations in job satisfaction, constructivist beliefs, and teacher co-operation across different self-efficacy profiles, and (c) examine the predictions of teacher background characteristics in relation to profile membership. By employing latent profile analysis, four distinct self-efficacy profiles were identified: (a) Low Self-Efficacy, (b) Moderate Self-Efficacy, (c) High Self-Efficacy, and (d) Divergent Moderate Self-Efficacy. The results also revealed significant differences in job satisfaction, constructivist beliefs, and teacher co-operation among the self-efficacy profiles. Moreover, teaching experience emerged as a significant predictor of profile membership. These highlight the need for tailored professional development programs and interventions that consider teachers’ self-efficacy profiles, teacher outcomes, and teaching experience.

        <title>Power Analyses for Estimation of Complier Average Causal Effects Under Random Encouragement Designs in Education Research: Theory and Guidance</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Random encouragement designs evaluate treatments that aim to increase participation in a program or activity. These randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can also assess the mediated effects of participation itself on longer term outcomes using a complier average causal effect (CACE) estimation framework. This article considers power analysis methods for such CACE analyses for a range of RCT designs, including nonclustered, clustered, and random block designs. The focus is on behavioral encouragements to promote action, such as text messaging, that are increasingly being tested in education trials. We derive asymptotic distributions of the CACE estimators using generalized estimating equations theory, which underlie the power formulas. We incorporate noncompliance from both the actual receipt of the encouragement and participation itself. An illustrative power analysis provides sample size guidance using an available Shiny R dashboard.

        <title>Profiles of general, test, and mathematics anxiety in 9- and 12-year-olds: relations to gender and mathematics achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As international focus increasingly turns to the need to build a future mathematics workforce, research has aimed to better understand the salient individual and contextual factors that influence maths engagement and achievement across development. This study investigates self-reported general anxiety, test anxiety, and maths anxiety in two cohorts of Australian students aged 9–10 years (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 158) and 12–13 years (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 115) and associations with maths achievement and gender. Test and maths anxiety were negatively correlated with maths achievement and there were no gender differences in maths achievement. Cross-sectional latent profile analyses established two anxiety profiles in the older cohort (low and high across all anxiety measures) and a more complex five-profile solution for the younger cohort (various combinations of anxiety). Members of profiles with higher levels of test and mathematics anxiety had lower maths achievement, with girls over-represented in these profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Conflation of Dual Language Bilingual Education With Gifted Programs in New York City Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As neighborhoods across New York City gentrify, Dual Language Bilingual Education (DLBE) has become a big draw for gentrifier families. Our research contributes to growing literature on DLBE gentrification by examining how a racially diverse group of parents in two communities perceived DLBE as a school choice option. We found that schools with DLBE programs screened potential students via academic screening tests or school choice processes to determine admission into DLBE programs. This screening process has contributed to a) the conflation of DLBE with the city’s gifted programs, and b) a focus away from admitting and centering emergent bilinguals. While this screening served to further advantage gentrifier families, some parents resisted the opportunity hoarding behaviors of their peers through their alternative school choices and advocacy efforts. In this way, we show how all parents are constrained and impacted by the neoliberal logics of contemporary DLBE policy and school choice.

        <title>Degrees of Return: Estimating Internal Rates of Return for College Majors Using Quantile Regression</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Using data collected from more than 5.8 million high school and college graduates ages 18 to 65 years who participated in the American Community Survey between 2009 and 2021, the authors estimate the internal rates of return (IRRs) for individuals with college degrees in 10 broad majors compared with high school graduates. The analysis shows significant differences in the age-earnings trajectories and IRRs across college majors. Furthermore, quantile regression analyses show that IRR is generally higher at the high end of the earnings distribution compared with the low end. Finally, the authors observed a slight decrease in IRR during the study period, which is consistent with the flattening and even decline in college wage premiums following the 2008 Great Recession.

        <title>Public Opinion on School Funding and Teacher Salaries: The Information Gap Explained?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We evaluate public opinion on the sufficiency of school funding and teacher salaries in the United States, using a representative survey (n = 12,151). Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020/2021), with schools and teachers having a reduced role due to homeschooling. While opinions are diverse for sufficiency of school funding, most respondents indicated that teacher salaries should increase. For respondents who received additional information about average school funding and teacher salaries, the overall opinion about funding and salaries being insufficient was less strong. Furthermore, this information effect differs as per respondents’ demographic variables.

        <title>Excellence for All? University Honors Programs and Human Capital Formation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Can public university Honors programs deliver the benefits of selective undergraduate education within otherwise nonselective institutions? We evaluate the impact of admission to the Honors College at Oregon State University, a large nonselective public university. Admission to the Honors College depends heavily on a numerical application score. Nonlinearities in admissions probabilities as a function of this score allow us to compare applicants with similar scores, but different admissions outcomes, via a fuzzy regression kink design. The first stage is strong, with take-up of Honors College programming closely following nonlinearities in admissions probabilities. To estimate the causal effect of Honors College admission on human capital formation, we use these nonlinearities in the admissions function as instruments, combined with course-section fixed effects to account for strategic course selection. Honors College admission increases course grades by 0.10 grade points on the 0 to 4 scale, or 0.14 standard deviations. Effects are concentrated at the top of the course grade distribution. However, course grades of first-generation students decrease in response to Honors admission, driven by low performance in natural science courses. Results suggest that selective Honors programs can accelerate skill acquisition for high-achieving students at public universities, but not all students benefit from Honors admission.

        <title>Forging a Path to College Persistence: An Experimental Evaluation of the Detroit Promise Path Program</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Detroit students who obtain a college degree overcome many obstacles to do so. This article reports the results of a randomized evaluation of a program meant to provide support to low-income community college students. The Detroit Promise Path program was designed to complement an existing College Promise scholarship, providing students with coaching, summer engagement, and financial incentives. The evaluation found that students offered the program enrolled in more semesters and earned more credits compared with those offered the scholarship alone. However, at the 3-year mark, there were no discernable impacts on degrees earned. This article examines systemic barriers to degree completion and offers lessons for the design of interventions to increase equity in postsecondary attainment.

        <title>How and Why Teachers Taught About the 2020 U.S. Election: An Analysis of Survey Responses From Twelve States</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;This study explores social studies teachers’ self-reported instruction about teaching the 2020 election in U.S. secondary schools. We analyzed survey responses from 1,723 secondary social studies teachers from 12 states (3 left-leaning, 3 right-leaning, 6 battleground) collected in the weeks after the election, examining self-reported pedagogies, topics taught, and overall frequency of teaching about the election. Respondents reported teaching about the election more frequently if they taught courses in civics or government and/or if they had greater control over their curricula. Analyses indicated that teachers’ demographic characteristics, teaching contexts, and ideologies about civic education were related to the election-related topics they taught and the instructional practices they employed. Our findings have important implications for educators, administrators, policymakers, and others interested in strengthening civic learning.

        <title>Checkbox grading of handwritten mathematics exams with multiple assessors: how do students react to the resulting atomic feedback? A mixed-method study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Handwritten tasks are better suited than digital ones to assess higher-order mathematics skills, as students can express themselves more freely. However, maintaining reliability and providing feedback can be challenging when assessing high-stakes, handwritten mathematics exams involving multiple assessors. This paper discusses a new semi-automated grading approach called ‘checkbox grading’. Checkbox grading gives each assessor a list of checkboxes consisting of feedback items for each task. The assessor then ticks those feedback items which apply to the student’s solution. Dependencies between the checkboxes can be set to ensure all assessors take the same route on the grading scheme. The system then automatically calculates the grade and provides atomic feedback to the student, giving a detailed insight into what went wrong and how the grade was obtained. Atomic feedback consists of a set of format requirements for mathematical feedback items, which has been shown to increase feedback’s reusability. Checkbox grading was tested during the final high school mathematics exam (grade 12) organised by the Flemish Exam Commission, with 60 students and 10 assessors. This paper focuses on students’ perceptions of the received checkbox grading feedback and how easily they interpreted it. After the exam was graded, all students were sent an online questionnaire, including their personalised exam feedback. The questionnaire was filled in by 36 students, and 4 of them participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings suggest that students could interpret the feedback from checkbox grading well, with no correlation between students’ exam scores and feedback understanding. Therefore, we suggest that checkbox grading is an effective way to provide feedback, also for students with shaky subject matter knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bridging the Gap Between Imagined and Plausible Futures for Refugees: What Students Wish Their Teachers Knew</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;There is a gap between the futures that refugee young people imagine will be possible through their education and the plausible futures in exile, where opportunities are truncated by social, economic, and political exclusions. Our study examines how education can narrow this gap. Through interviews with Syrian students in Lebanon, we document fixed and malleable elements of education that refugee students identify as bridging their current education and their futures. Students experience the structures and content of schooling in Lebanon as both exclusionary and immutable, yet their teachers use what we call relational pedagogies rooted in predictability, explaining, fairness, and care to support students’ learning and navigation toward future opportunities. While our research focuses on refugees, it has conceptual implications for educators and school systems in other settings where teachers support their marginalized students to make sense of disconnects between what they imagine is possible through school and their future opportunities.

        <title>Generalizing actions with the subtraction-compensation property: primary students’ algebraic thinking with tasks involving vertical towers of blocks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important approach for developing children’s algebraic thinking involves introducing them to generalized arithmetic at the time they are learning arithmetic. Our aim in this study was to investigate children’s attention to and expression of generality with the subtraction-compensation property, as evidence of a type of algebraic thinking known as relational thinking. The tasks involved subtraction modelled as difference and comparing the heights of towers of blocks. In an exploratory qualitative study, 22 middle primary (9–11-year-old) students from two schools participated in individual videoed interviews. The tasks were designed using theoretical perspectives on embodied visualization and concreteness fading to provide multiple opportunities for the students to make sense of subtraction as difference and to advance their relational thinking. Twelve out of 22 students evidenced conceptual understanding of the comparison model of subtraction (subtraction as difference) and expression of the compensation property of equality. Four of these students repeatedly evidenced relational thinking for true/false tasks and open equivalence tasks. A proposed framework for levels of attention to/expression of generality with the subtraction-compensation property is shared and suggestions for further research are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Tension Between Allowing Student Struggle and Providing Support When Teaching Problem-Solving in Primary School Mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This article reports two primary school teachers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of lessons based on a problem-solving intervention. The intervention included enabling and extending prompts, independent student struggle time initially and time to share problem-solving strategies at the end. The intervention had two versions: one included whole class prompts and teachers anticipated students’ responses before teaching; the other without these features. Each teacher implemented two lessons in year 1/2 composite classes, with one lesson common. Teachers identified positive impacts of the intervention including providing support for students, extending students’ thinking and providing positive challenge during problem-solving. Struggle time was believed to negatively impact some students’ resilience and confidence; both teachers deviated from the intervention to reduce struggle time. Students used more problem-solving strategies when struggle time was included compared to when the teacher modelled an approach for solving. There was a tension for teachers between providing time for students to struggle and preserving some students’ confidence. One teacher facilitated student share time in the middle of one lesson, allowing students to experience both struggle and success; this compromise could address the tension. Overall, the intervention was perceived to positively impact teaching practice.&lt;/p&gt;
