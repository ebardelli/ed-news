        <title>Impact of a Mathematics Bridging Course on the Motivation and Learning Skills of University Students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The transition from secondary to tertiary education is an exciting and yet challenging event in the educational biography of students. During this transition, students often meet with unexpected challenges, which may cause them to drop out from their degree program. Many universities offer bridging courses or longer-term interventions to support their incoming students in this period. To examine the effect of a bridging course designed to reduce gaps in prior mathematical knowledge, promote social-emotional well-being, and foster learning skills, we implement a repeated-measures intervention study. We analyze the outcomes of the intervention, which features tutors with special training, autonomous choice of topic areas, peer learning, and materials for self-directed learning. We measure the development of motivational beliefs reflecting the will to learn (achievement goals, satisfaction of basic psychological needs, implicit theories, self-efficacy) and the skills to learn (reactions to errors, self-regulated learning) at the secondary-tertiary transition. These aspects are captured at multiple measurement points among students (N = 679) who participate in the bridging course (intervention group) and those who do not (control group). The intervention boosts motivational beliefs related to social embeddedness and learning skills in the short term. The observed decrease in autonomy, competence, and self-efficacy might be explained by higher standards that students use for their self-assessment in the new peer group. In the long term, all aspects of the will to learn, except for social relatedness, show stable to strongly negative developments in both groups. Among those students who do not participate in the bridging course, mostly strongly negative developments are observed. The results suggest that the peer tutoring strategy is highly effective and the need for longer-term interventions to uphold the positive short-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Applying ‘merging of knowledge’ in Tanzania: What can we learn about interrupting patterned relationships to reveal hidden dimensions of poverty?</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Merging of Knowledge is a research approach that creates the conditions for people with lived experience of poverty to participate at an equal level with academics and practitioners, in the co-generation of knowledge about poverty. This paper reflects critically on the application of ‘Merging of Knowledge’ to study poverty in Tanzania, assessing its challenges, achievements, and lessons learned about revealing hidden knowledge about poverty. It also provides a brief literature review to place the Merging of Knowledge alongside other participatory approaches. This paper finds that Merging of Knowledge can effectively interrupt patterned social relationships, and empower individuals and peer groups, thereby stimulating transformation of both academics and people and poverty. It does so by addressing imbalances in social status, empowering all groups of participants at each stage of the research, and building trust, confidence, and freedom from fear in a sustainable manner. The conclusion drawn is that Merging of Knowledge holds great promise for future research on topics where strong hierarchies of knowledge exist, and where the physical inclusion of participants in data collection is not readily translated into intellectual inclusivity during analysis and the dissemination of findings.

        <title>Acting Upon Student Voice-Based Teaching Assessment Initiatives: An Account of Participatory Action Research for Teacher Professional Learning</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Numerous nations implement Student Perception Surveys (SPS) in their schools to assess teaching for student learning improvement. However, research suggests no significant change in teachers’ practices following such student voice-based assessment initiatives, noting their struggle to act upon it. Utilizing the pyramid of student voice as a key framework, we investigate how a Participatory Action Research (PAR)-based professional development (PD) shapes a group of Australian secondary teachers’ interaction with SPS and professional learning. Analyses of the teachers’ interviews, research projects, and reflective notes about their use of SPS illustrate how the PAR-based PD informed their practice, specifically: (i) transforming ‘survey fatigue’ to increased student voice; (ii) contemplating personal, professional, and political entanglements; and (iii) (re)building teacher agency—employing SPS as collective learning tools of professional empowerment rather than accountability measures of teaching. Implications include pathways to strengthen teachers’ agency—honoring their professionalism—in assessment spaces increasingly shaped by student voices.

        <title>What Is the Empirical Research Base of Early Childhood Coaching? A Mapping Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examined the empirical base for early childhood (birth to 8) coaching via a systematic mapping review of the relevant literature, including diverse research designs to represent the full breadth of published studies related to early childhood coaching. The systematic review yielded 374 unique studies published between 1987 and 2019 that were coded for type of study design (e.g., causal; quantitative noncausal; qualitative; single-case design); research populations; and reported content, structure, and processes of early childhood coaching. Descriptive analyses revealed that almost half of the study designs were causal (45.99%); over 75% of the studies were interested in the outcomes or experiences of teachers. The most targeted coaching content domains were social-emotional (44.92% of studies) and language/literacy development (43.58% of studies). Reporting on coaching structure was inconsistent across studies. Observation was the most reported coaching strategy during instruction (73.53% of studies), and provision of evaluative feedback was the most frequently reported coaching strategy outside of instruction (62.83% of studies). The review identified the literature base includes a diversity of study designs, and a great majority of studies occur in preschool settings (70.32%). Findings also suggest that a growing number of coaching studies are focused on child outcomes (60.16%). Results indicate a need for more studies that focus on coaches directly as well as research about coaching in infant/toddler programs and in content domains beyond social-emotional and language/literacy.

        <title>ebct: Using entropy balancing for continuous treatments to estimate dose–response functions and their derivatives</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 709-729, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Interest in evaluating dose–response functions of continuous treatments has been increasing recently. To facilitate the estimation of causal effects in this setting, I introduce the ebct command for the estimation of dose–response functions and their derivatives using entropy balancing for continuous treatments. First, balancing weights are estimated by numerically solving a globally convex optimization problem. These weights eradicate Pearson correlations between covariates and the treatment variable. Because simple uncorrelatedness may be insufficient to yield consistent estimates in the next step, higher moments of the treatment variable can be rendered uncorrelated with covariates. Second, the weights are used in local linear kernel regressions to estimate the dose–response function or its derivative. To perform statistical inference, I use a bootstrap procedure. The command also provides the option of producing publication-quality graphs for the estimated relationships.

        <title>cntraveltime: Travel distance and travel time in China</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 730-753, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we introduce the command cntraveltime, which can calculate both the travel distance and the travel time between two locations in China with respect to different modes of transportation (driving, public transport, and cycling). Existing commands such as georoute, traveltime, and mqtime have difficulties in parsing Chinese locations. cntraveltime solves this outstanding challenge via a feature that enables it to call route-planning services from the Baidu Maps Open Platform. The results of rigorous testing on the features of the command show that, relative to similar existing commands, cntraveltime has the highest capacity in terms of functionality and precision. This suggests that it can be regarded as a useful complement to other existing commands, especially when calculating travel distance and time for locations within China.

        <title>Robit regression in Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 658-682, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Logistic and probit models are the most popular regression models for binary outcomes. A simple robust alternative is the robit model, which replaces the underlying normal distribution in the probit model with a Student’s t distribution. The heavier tails of the t distribution (compared with the normal distribution) mean that model outliers are less influential. Robit regression models can be fit as generalized linear models with the link function defined as the inverse cumulative t distribution function with a specified number of degrees of freedom; they have been advocated as being particularly suitable for estimating inverse-probability weights and propensity scoring more generally. Here we describe a new command, robit, that implements robit regression in Stata.

        <title>mpitb: A toolbox for multidimensional poverty indices</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 625-657, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, I present mpitb, a toolbox for multidimensional poverty indices (MPIs). The package mpitb comprises several subcommands to facilitate specification, estimation, and analyses of MPIs and supports the popular Alkire– Foster framework to multidimensional poverty measurement. mpitb offers several benefits to researchers, analysts, and practitioners working on MPIs, including substantial time savings (for example, because of lower data management and programming requirements) while allowing for a more comprehensive analysis at the same time. Aside from various convenience functions, mpitb also provides low-level tools for advanced users and programmers.

        <title>Facilities for optimizing and designing multiarm multistage (MAMS) randomized controlled trials with binary outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 774-798, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;We introduce two commands, nstagebin and nstagebinopt, that can be used to facilitate the design of multiarm multistage (MAMS) trials with binary outcomes. MAMS designs are a class of efficient and adaptive randomized clinical trials that have successfully been used in many disease areas, including cancer, tuberculosis, maternal health, COVID-19, and surgery. The nstagebinopt command finds a class of efficient “admissible” designs based on an optimality criterion using a systematic search procedure. The nstagebin command calculates the stagewise sample sizes, trial timelines, and overall operating characteristics of MAMS designs with binary outcomes. Both commands allow the use of Dunnett’s correction to account for multiple testing. We also use the ROSSINI 2 MAMS design, an ongoing MAMS trial in surgical wound infection, to illustrate the capabilities of both commands. The new commands facilitate the design of MAMS trials with binary outcomes where more than one research question can be addressed under one protocol.

        <title>iefieldkit: Commands for primary data collection and cleaning (update)</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 875-883, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Data collection and cleaning workflows implement highly repetitive but extremely important processes. In this article, we describe an update to iefieldkit, a package developed to standardize and simplify best practices for high-quality primary data collection across the World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation department. The first release of iefieldkit provided workflows to automate error checking for Open Data Kit-based survey modules, duplicate management, data cleaning, and codebook creation. This update to the package includes improved commands to document and implement data point corrections, verify the structure or contents of data using codebooks, and create replicationready data through automated variable subsetting.

The command simplifies adjusting for individual- and cluster-level covariates and can also account for a stratified design. It can be used to analyze a continuous, binary, or rate outcome.

        <title>Speaking Stata: Replacing missing values: The easiest problems</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 884-896, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Missing values are common in real datasets, and what to do about them is a large and challenging question. This column focuses on the easiest problems in which a researcher is clear, or at least highly confident, about what missing values should be instead, implying a deterministic replacement. The main tricks are copying values from observation to observation and using the ipolate command. Both may often be extended simply to panel or longitudinal datasets or to other datasets with a group structure, such as data on individuals within families or households. This column includes how to satisfy constraints that interpolation is confined to filling gaps between values known to be equal or to observations moderately close to a known value in time or in some other sequence or position variable.

        <title>hdps: A suite of commands for applying high-dimensional propensity-score approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 683-708, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Large healthcare databases are increasingly used for research investigating the effects of medications. However, a key challenge is capturing hard-to-measure concepts (often relating to frailty and disease severity) that can be crucial for successful confounder adjustment. The high-dimensional propensity score has been proposed as a data-driven method to improve confounder adjustment within healthcare databases and was developed in the context of administrative claims databases. We present hdps, a suite of commands implementing this approach in Stata that assesses the prevalence of codes, generates high-dimensional propensity-score covariates, performs variable selection, and provides investigators with graphical tools for inspecting the properties of selected covariates.

        <title>Iterative intercensal single-decrement life tables using Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 813-834, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;One way to estimate mortality in countries with incomplete data is to utilize intercensal methods, which do not require model life tables and provide accurate results even in the presence of age distortions and death underregistration. In this article, I revisit three of these techniques (census based, death distribution, and an iterative procedure) and introduce ilt, a command to calculate singledecrement life tables and the net flow of migrants by age. The required inputs are two age-specific population distributions and the average number of deaths between them. The empirical example draws on data from Vietnam, but the methods are extendable to any context and period.

        <title>Estimating text regressions using txtreg_train</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 799-812, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, I introduce new commands to estimate text regressions for continuous, binary, and categorical variables based on text strings. The command txtreg_train automatically handles text cleaning, tokenization, model training, and cross-validation for lasso, ridge, elastic-net, and regularized logistic regressions. The txtreg_predict command obtains the predictions from the trained text regression model. Furthermore, the txtreg_analyze command facilitates the analysis of the coefficients of the text regression model. Together, these commands provide a convenient toolbox for researchers to train text regressions. They also allow sharing of pretrained text regression models with other researchers.

        <title>winratiotest: A command for implementing the win ratio and stratified win ratio in Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 835-850, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The win ratio is a statistical method most commonly used for analyzing composite outcomes in clinical trials. Composite outcomes comprise two or more distinct “component” events (for example, myocardial infarction or death) and are typically analyzed using time-to-first-event methods ignoring the relative importance of the component events. When using the win ratio, component events are instead placed into a hierarchy from most to least important; more important components can then be prioritized over less important outcomes (for example, death can be prioritized over myocardial infarction). Furthermore, the win ratio enables outcomes of different types (for example, time-to-event, continuous, binary, ordinal, and repeat events) to be combined. We present winratiotest, a command to implement the win-ratio approach for hierarchical outcomes in a flexible and user-friendly way.

        <title>synth2: Synthetic control method with placebo tests, robustness test, and visualization</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 597-624, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The synthetic control method (Abadie and Gardeazabal, 2003, American Economic Review 93: 113–132, Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2010, Journal of the American Statistical Association 105: 493–505) is a popular method for causal inference in panel data with one treated unit that often uses placebo tests for statistical inference. While the synthetic control method can be implemented by the excellent command synth (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller, 2011, Statistical Software Components S457334, Department of Economics, Boston College), it is still inconvenient for users to conduct placebo tests. As a wrapper program for synth, our proposed synth2 command provides convenient utilities to automate both in-space and in-time placebo tests, as well as the leave-one-out robustness test. Moreover, synth2 produces a complete set of graphs to visualize covariate or unit weights, covariate balance, actual or predicted outcomes, treatment effects, placebo tests, ratio of posttreatment mean squared prediction error to pretreatment mean squared prediction error, pointwise p-values (two-sided, right-sided, and left-sided), and the leave-one-out robustness test. We illustrate the use of the synth2 command by revisiting the classic example of California’s tobacco control program (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010).

        <title>blandaltman: A command to create variants of Bland–Altman plots</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/3&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 851-874, September 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Bland–Altman plots can be useful in paired data settings such as measurement-method comparison studies. A Bland–Altman plot has differences, percentage differences, or ratios on the y axis and a mean of the data pairs on the x axis, with 95% limits of agreement indicating the central 95% range of differences, percentage differences, or ratios. This range can vary with the mean. We introduce the community-contributed blandaltman command, which uniquely in Stata can 1) create Bland–Altman plots featuring ratios in addition to differences and percentage differences, 2) allow the limits of agreement for ratios and percentage differences to vary as a function of the mean, and 3) add confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and tolerance intervals to the plots.

        <title>Connecting mathematics to STEM education: interdisciplinary teaching and learning facilitation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, empirical evidence is required that points to the educational contribution of mathematics. Specifically, researchers are not clear how mathematics weaves itself through the STEM education meta-discourse. This article contributes to pedagogical practices in educational institutions where STEM has been newly introduced - What are the perceptions and experiences of South African teachers on interdisciplinary STEM education, and how do mathematics and interdisciplinary STEM discourses leverage each other at schools of specialisation (SoS) in South Africa? Participant teachers were drawn from ten SoS in South Africa. SoS are STEM-dense schools in South Africa’s Gauteng Province, the country’s industrial and commercial hub. Interview data was collected on teachers’ experiences and practices to explore the affordances of Mathematics and other STEM disciplines to influencing curriculum advancement. Situated cognition, mathematics as explorations and flow theory informed this qualitative study. In the findings, technology was regarded as raising learner motivation and mathematical achievement. Important to the study is that participants have a high regard for mathematics’ role in interdisciplinary STEM education. In the study, teachers had no autonomy to pursue the STEM agenda, as they were bound to adhere to a prescribed curriculum, which hardly refers to implementation of interdisciplinary STEM education. Various recommendations are proffered, such as maintaining the positive perceptions participants have on the role of mathematics in STEM curricula. The research calls for equality and equity of all the STEM disciplines, as one STEM curricula cannot succeed without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
