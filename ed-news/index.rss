        <title>bELonging: Do Students Classified as English Learners Feel Included?</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we analyze student survey data related to sense of belonging and relationships with teachers and adults within and across the fastest growing subgroup of K–12 public school students: students classified as English learners (ELs). Students classified as ELs in our study, overall, felt a similar sense of belonging, or slightly higher sense of belonging than their never and formerly EL-classified peers; however, within the sense of belonging constructs, students classified as ELs varied in their perceptions of school climate. Additionally, current EL-classified students who took the survey in English were more positive than those who took the survey in another language; however, once student demographics and school contexts were held constant, survey language was weakly related to our outcome measures. We conclude by discussing how our findings can guide K–12 education policies, practices, and research to foster inclusive educational environments.

        <title>Equity in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper reviews research on equity in mathematics education (excluding gender equity) for the period 2017–2022. From the publications identified, five themes were distilled: conceptualizations and framing of equity in mathematics education; research methodologies and researcher positionalities; equity-focused practices, pedagogies and teacher education; equitable mathematics curriculum content, access and pathways; and equity in mathematics education at system levels, nationally and internationally. The review concludes by engaging some of the critique and suggests future directions for research. The research demonstrates that there is growing voice and visibility of equity-focused studies in mathematics education and that conceptualizations of equity have broadened and deepened through an increasing diversity of studies in this area. At the same time, the review also shows the dominance of the Global North in shaping equity discourses and the paucity of research on equity in mathematics education from the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Collective Bargaining Agreement Restrictiveness in Unionized Charter Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although charter schools are frequently afforded flexibility from many state laws that govern traditional public schools, a growing number of charter school teachers have now unionized and introduced collective bargaining to the charter sector. Using data from a detailed content analysis of teacher CBAs from California, we compare the restrictiveness of CBAs in 75 unionized charter bargaining units to the restrictiveness of CBAs in 31 nearest neighbor traditional public school district bargaining units. We find that independent charter CBAs are much more flexible than the CBAs of traditional public school districts, but charter school CBAs of bargaining units combined with traditional public school districts are comparably restrictive.

        <title>Investigating Arts Education Effects on School Engagement and Climate</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;There is a renewed focus on what constitutes a well-rounded education, as well as a growing interest in broader indicators of educational success, including social and emotional development and school engagement. However, identifying educational practices that improve such outcomes has proven elusive. We explore the role of arts education on a broad range of educational outcomes using administrative and survey data from Boston’s public schools. We find that students receiving the arts in school attend more, are more engaged, and their parents and teachers are more likely to participate and be engaged at school, with larger effects for students with individualized education plans, students with lower standardized test scores, and students with a history of chronic absenteeism. These findings call attention to the pivotal role of the arts in providing students with socially and emotionally supportive learning environments that enhance relationships between students and schools.

        <title>Troublemakers? The Role of Frequent Teacher Referrers in Expanding Racial Disciplinary Disproportionalities</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teachers’ sensemaking of student behavior determines whether students get in trouble and are formally disciplined. Status categories, such as race, can influence perceptions of student culpability, but the degree to which teachers’ initial identification of student misbehavior exacerbates racial disproportionality in discipline receipt is unknown. This study provides the first systematic documentation of teachers’ use of office discipline referrals (ODRs) in a large, diverse urban school district in California that specifies the identity of both the referred and referring individuals in all ODRs. We identify teachers exhibiting extensive referring behavior, or the top 5% referrers, based on the number of ODRs they make in a given year and evaluate their contributions to disciplinary disparities. We find that “top referrers” effectively double the racial gaps in ODRs for both Black-White and Hispanic-White comparisons. These gaps are mainly driven by higher numbers of ODRs issued for Black and Hispanic students due to interpersonal offences and defiance and also partially convert to racial gaps in suspensions. Both the level and racial compositions of the school sites where top referrers serve and their personal traits seem to explain some of their frequent referring behavior. Targeting supports and interventions to top referrers might afford an important opportunity to reduce racial disciplinary gaps.

        <title>When Shutting the Door Won’t Do: Teaching With the Specter of Community Backlash and the Implications for Teacher Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Recently, numerous news stories have detailed the ways teachers across the country have been disciplined for addressing issues of oppression and justice in their schools. This paper engages poststructural discourse analysis to consider data from a year-long study of recent graduates of a justice-oriented teacher education program during their first year teaching, examining the ways that stories of community backlash functioned to discipline early career teachers to behave in particular ways. I theorize that these stories serve to discourage teachers from pursuing justice-oriented work in the classroom and that such discourses must be addressed in teacher education programs to prepare preservice teachers for the political realities of entering classrooms in the United States in the current cultural moment.

        <title>Bayesian Exploratory Factor Analysis via Gibbs Sampling</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Bayesian methods to infer model dimensionality in factor analysis generally assume a lower triangular structure for the factor loadings matrix. Consequently, the ordering of the outcomes influences the results. Therefore, we propose a method to infer model dimensionality without imposing any prior restriction on the loadings matrix. Our approach considers a relatively large number of factors and includes auxiliary multiplicative parameters, which may render null the unnecessary columns in the loadings matrix. The underlying dimensionality is then inferred based on the number of nonnull columns in the factor loadings matrix, and the model parameters are estimated with a postprocessing scheme. The advantages of the method in selecting the correct dimensionality are illustrated via simulations and using real data sets.

        <title>Deep Learning Imputation for Asymmetric and Incomplete Likert-Type Items</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Asymmetric Likert-type items in research studies can present several challenges in data analysis, particularly concerning missing data. These items are often characterized by a skewed scaling, where either there is no neutral response option or an unequal number of possible positive and negative responses. The use of conventional techniques, such as discriminant analysis or logistic regression imputation, for handling missing data in asymmetric items may result in significant bias. It is also recommended to exercise caution when employing alternative strategies, such as listwise deletion or mean imputation, because these methods rely on assumptions that are often unrealistic in surveys and rating scales. This article explores the potential of implementing a deep learning-based imputation method. Additionally, we provide access to deep learning-based imputation to a broader group of researchers without requiring advanced machine learning training. We apply the methodology to the Wilmington Street Participatory Action Research Health Project.

        <title>Bayesian Estimation of Attribute Hierarchy for Cognitive Diagnosis Models</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Attribute hierarchy, the underlying prerequisite relationship among attributes, plays an important role in applying cognitive diagnosis models (CDM) for designing efficient cognitive diagnostic assessments. However, there are limited statistical tools to directly estimate attribute hierarchy from response data. In this study, we proposed a Bayesian formulation for attribute hierarchy within CDM framework and developed an efficient Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm to estimate the underlying hierarchy along with the specified CDM parameters. Our proposed estimation method is flexible and can be adapted to a general class of CDMs. We demonstrated our proposed method via a simulation study, and the results from which show that the proposed method can fully recover or estimate at least a subgraph of the underlying structure across various conditions under a specified CDM model. The real data application indicates the potential of learning attribute structure from data using our algorithm and validating the existing attribute hierarchy specified by content experts.

        <title>Knowledge-in-action for crafting mathematics problems in realistic contexts</title>

            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study articulates the epistemological support of reflective practices for the professional practice of crafting mathematics problems in realistic contexts. The data were collected from 15 middle school pre-service mathematics teachers in two semesters as they were generating problems and engaging in three reflective practices, which served to elicit their knowledge-in-action. The prospective teachers’ reflections indicated that the knowledge-in-action for crafting realistic mathematics problems encompassed various but particular forms of the content; that is, pedagogical, curricular, and interdisciplinary forms of the content. Thus, particularly for the professional practice of crafting realistic mathematics problems, the prospective teachers identified epistemological supports that blended not only content and pedagogy but also other knowledge dimensions, which have crucial implications for mathematics teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A framework for selecting strategies for whole-class discussions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study focused on the practice of selecting student strategies for whole-class discussions with teachers working toward a vision of instruction that is responsive to students’ mathematical thinking. Selecting strategies is one of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;5 practices&lt;/em&gt; identified in Smith and Stein&#39;s (5 practices for orchestrating productive mathematics discussions, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2018) seminal work on orchestrating productive mathematics discussions, but I argue that this practice has been under-appreciated and under-researched, and implementation remains challenging for many teachers. To address these issues, I explored the selecting of student strategies with two sets of upper elementary school teachers engaged in professional development focused on the teaching and learning of fractions. One set consisted of 3 teachers who had demonstrated expertise in teaching that is responsive to students’ mathematical thinking, and I explored the selecting of strategies in these teachers’ classrooms. The other set consisted of 30 teachers with varying levels of expertise in this type of teaching, and I examined their selecting of strategies during professional development activities. Findings led to the creation of a two-level framework that showcases teachers’ criteria for selecting strategies for whole-class mathematics discussions. The framework, which extends and adds a coherent structure to selection criteria currently identified in the literature, highlights considerations related to the mathematics of the strategy, the author of the strategy, and the class engagement with the strategy. The framework, which is presented through a case, was designed to not only provide guidance for the purposeful selection of strategies but also to be accessible and useful to teachers at any phase of their development in being responsive to students’ mathematical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teacher expertise for fostering at-risk students’ understanding of basic concepts: conceptual model and evidence for growth﻿</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Various intervention programs for fostering at-risk students’ understanding of basic concepts (such as place value understanding or meanings of multiplication and division) have been developed and evaluated. However, little is known about the teacher expertise required to enact these intervention programs, and how this teacher expertise can be promoted. The article suggests a conceptual model for teacher expertise for fostering at-risk students’ understanding based on three recurrent jobs: (a) &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;specify&lt;/em&gt; learning content (in basic concepts), (b) &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;monitor&lt;/em&gt; students’ learning progress (in basic concepts) and (3) &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;enhance&lt;/em&gt; students’ understanding (of basic concepts). Mastering these jobs with productive teaching practices involves four orientations in particular (conceptual rather than procedural orientation, diagnostic rather than syllabus-led orientation, communicative rather than individualistic orientation, and long-term rather than short-term orientation) as well as detailed pedagogical content categories for unpacking relevant knowledge elements. The paper reports on the professional development program &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mastering Math&lt;/em&gt; which aims at promoting this expertise and its evaluation using a pre–post-design. For 95 participating teachers, the practices for specifying goals and monitoring and enhancing at-risk students’ understanding were captured in self-reports and situated in vignette-based activities for eliciting diagnostic judgments. Teachers’ development across different aspects of their expertise from the beginning and the end of the 1-year PD reveals the first quantitative evidence that the PD was effective in promoting growth of expertise. Whereas specifying and monitoring practices had substantially developed, the enhancement practices were hindered by a persistent short-term orientation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How elementary prospective teachers use three fraction models: their perceptions and difficulties</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study is an examination of 79 elementary prospective teachers’ (PSTs’) capacity for recognizing the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems and their difficulties in solving and presenting the process of fraction addition using area, length, and set models. PSTs completed a written task in which they represented the process of solving a set of fraction addition problems of varying complexity in terms of the sizes of the addends, the sums, and the denominators using the three models. The PSTs’ responses to the task were analyzed and clustered to identify the most salient and recurring patterns of erroneous approaches to modeling. While the PSTs recognized the core ideas involved in modeling fraction addition problems, their actual work samples demonstrated several areas for improvement. Some PSTs had invalid answers and representations that were indicative of their misunderstanding of key concepts. Some PSTs had correct answers, but their model did not support sense-making. Additionally, some PSTs’ representations did not clearly incorporate the salient properties of the area, length, and set models. Our analysis generated implications for mathematics teacher educators regarding what PSTs need to learn, develop further, unlearn, and refine in order to effectively teach uses of representation in elementary classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Generalizing Beyond the Test: Permutation-Based Profile Analysis for Explaining DIF Using Item Features</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Profile analysis is one of the main tools for studying whether differential item functioning can be related to specific features of test items. While relevant, profile analysis in its current form has two restrictions that limit its usefulness in practice: It assumes that all test items have equal discrimination parameters, and it does not test whether conclusions about the item-feature effects generalize outside of the considered set of items. This article addresses both of these limitations, by generalizing profile analysis to work under the two-parameter logistic model and by proposing a permutation test that allows for generalizable conclusions about item-feature effects. The developed methods are evaluated in a simulation study and illustrated using Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 Science data.

        <title>Transformation of preservice mathematics teachers&#39; teacher identity orientations through a video club</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research in mathematics education has placed significant emphasis on teacher identity, particularly during teacher education, since it plays a critical role in shaping the identity of preservice teachers with regard to teaching mathematics. However, as teacher identity is context dependent, it is essential to study preservice teachers&#39; identities in various contexts to develop expertise in mathematics teacher education. This study explored the transformation of preservice mathematics teachers’ (PMTs) teacher identity orientations after participating in a video club. Concentrating on task perceptions as the indicator of teacher identity, the change in the teacher roles that PMTs would like to adopt in the future and the student outcomes they associated with these roles were investigated. The analysis of teacher identity orientations before and after participating in the video club revealed that PMTs’ teacher identity orientations were transformed by their participation because the video club increased their self-awareness and understanding of the complexity of teaching mathematics. The most noticeable transformation was observed in the didactical roles and their associated outcomes. These roles were transformed from being a didactical expert aiming to develop students’ affective outcomes to being a didactical expert who prioritizes students’ cognitions. Although PMTs’ expertise in teaching mathematics and the content of the video cases limited their orientations, the video club can simulate alternative experiences for teacher education programs aiming to support PMTs’ teacher identity orientations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How current perspectives on algorithmic thinking can be applied to students’ engagement in algorithmatizing tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this study is to examine how algorithmatizing tasks engage mathematics students in algorithmic thinking. Structured, task-based interviews were conducted with eight Year 12 students as they completed a sequence of algorithmatizing tasks involving maximum flow problems. A deductive-inductive analytical process was used to first classify students’ mathematical behavior according to four cognitive skills of algorithmic thinking (decomposition, abstraction, algorithmization, and debugging) and then develop sets of subskills to describe how the students engaged these cognitive skills. The findings show how students used algorithmic thinking to solve maximum flow problems and then made progress towards creating a general algorithm before being introduced to the maximum-flow minimum-cut approach, which guarantees a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On-Campus vs Distance Tutorials in Preparatory Courses for Mathematics Student Teachers – Performance Gains and Influencing Factors</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, new instructional designs for mathematics courses have recently been developed. Unlike traditional e-learning courses, distance learning via videoconferencing contains more synchronous elements and is therefore more closely related to classroom instruction. Since theories of person-environment fit suggest that course modality may have an impact on learning processes, this study compares the effectiveness of on-campus (in-person) and synchronous distance tutorials as essential components of a mathematics preparatory course. Using a within-between-subject design, we examined performance gains of first-year student teachers (primary and lower secondary level) during a two-week preparatory course in relation to (1) tutorial variation, (2) students’ prior knowledge, and (3) general and specific affective factors. Overall, our results indicate that preparatory courses with on-campus and distance tutorials can be similarly effective. However, considering students’ prior knowledge as measured by an entrance test, the course variant proved to be a decisive factor for students with higher test scores: While students with lower scores showed comparable performance gains in both on-campus and distance tutorials, students with higher scores increased their mathematics performance only in on-campus tutorials. Furthermore, the results indicate that the impact of affective factors on course performance differs in the two tutorial variants. While students’ self-efficacy and engagement predict learning outcomes in on-campus tutorials, mathematics performance in distance tutorials is positively influenced by self-efficacy and satisfaction and negatively influenced by procrastination and social relatedness. Thus, the results shed light on how instructors can design on-campus and distance tutorials to promote effective learning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Ecometric Data to Explore Sources of Cross-Site Impact Variance in Multi-Site Trials</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Background: In 2003, Bloom, Hill, and Riccio (BHR) published an influential paper introducing novel methods for explaining the variation in local impacts observed in multi-site randomized control trials of socio-economic interventions in terms of site-level mediators. This paper seeks to improve upon this previous work by using student-level data to measure site-level mediators and confounders. Research Design: Development of asymptotic behavior backed up with simulations and an empirical example. Subjects: Students and training providers. Two simulations and an empirical application to data from an evaluation of the Health Professions Opportunity Grants (HPOG) Program. This empirical analysis involved roughly 6600 participants across 37 local sites. Measures: We examine bias and mean square error of estimates of mediation coefficients as well as the true coverage of nominal 95-percent confidence intervals on the mediation coefficients. Results: Simulations suggest that the new methods generally improve the quality of inferences even when there is no confounding. Applying this methodology to the HPOG study shows that program-average FTE months of study by month six was a significant mediator of both career progress and long-term degree/credential receipt. Conclusions: Evaluators can robustify their BHR-style analyses by the use of the methods proposed here.

        <title>Rethinking School Improvement Organizations: Understanding Their Variety, Benefits, Risks, and Future Directions</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School practices and policies are often influenced by various research, nonprofit, for-profit, and philanthropic organizations. To help understand their influence, this article provides a framework accounting for the variety of school improvement organizations (SIOs) and summarizes debates regarding their benefits and risks. I cluster SIOs as providing (a) direct school support, (b) research/advocacy, or (c) funding—each with a continuum of organizations underneath them. Studies highlight how SIOs take innovative risks, create improvement networks, and transform school practices. However, they also emphasize the danger of creating challengers to public institutions, the possibility of state retreat, and loss of community input. The article concludes by suggesting ways to use this framework for future studies, assess SIOs’ outcomes, and address their risks.
