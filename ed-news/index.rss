        <title>The Role of Immigrant Generation and Mentors in Educational Attainment</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Social capital, including engagement with mentors, facilitates educational attainment. However, engagement with mentors differs significantly across groups of adolescents with different backgrounds, including an immigrant background. We investigate how immigrant generation predicts adolescents’ engagement with mentors and different types of mentors (i.e., school-based and non-school-based), the association of mentors with educational attainment, and these estimates’ heterogeneity based on the immigrant generation. We analyzed nationally representative Add Health data from N = 11,242 adolescents by using school fixed-effect linear probability models. Results show that adolescents from immigrant generations 1 and 2 were less likely than those from generation 3+ to have a mentor, but there were no significant differences in engaging with school-based mentors. Mentors predicted educational attainment; school-based mentor effects were larger than non-school-based mentor effects. The associations between mentors and college attendance and graduation were largest for first-generation immigrants. Our findings indicate the importance of structures supporting relationship-building and mentorship in schools and wider communities.

        <title>Does Institutional Quality Matter for Foreign Direct Investment and Human Development?</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), institutional quality and human development) in host countries from 2002 to 2019, using the Human Development Index [HDI] as the measure of human development. This study utilized a panel dataset of 143 countries, including both developed and developing economies, over a 17-year period. Additionally, the study employed a GMM (generalized method of moments) estimator to address unobservable heterogeneity and simultaneity. This study reveals a significant positive relationship between FDI and human development, with a stronger effect observed in developing countries compared to in developed countries. Notably, the impact of FDI-HDI nexus is larger in countries with moderately high-quality institutions, irrespective of their income level. Furthermore, good governance plays a crucial role in enhancing human development, as developing economies with high governance quality experience a greater impact of FDI on HDI compared to other countries. The findings of this study suggest that attracting FDI can be beneficial for enhancing the HDI, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the study highlights governance as a moderating factor in the relationship between FDI and HDI. Improving governance quality can enhance the positive impact of FDI on human development in host countries, especially in developing countries.

        <title>Adding Color to My Tears: Toward a Theoretical Framework for Antiblackness in School Discipline</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Persistent racial disparities in students’ disciplinary outcomes have been one of the most concerning educational policy and equity topics for decades. Despite the hypervisibility of Black students in school discipline conversations, research and practice evade a focus on anti-Black racism. In this essay, we draw from Black Critical Theory (BlackCrit) to present a theoretical framework that researchers and educational stakeholders can use to specify, study, and understand antiblackness in school discipline. We outline and discuss six interrelated theoretical constructs of the Antiblackness in School Discipline framework: (a) “Trading Away the Black,” (b) “Whites as Propertied,” (c) Intersecting Blackness, (d) Racial Neoliberalism, (e) La Petite Misère, and (f) Internalized Racism. Examples of studies providing empirical support for these theoretical tenets are also discussed, and suggestions for utilizing this framework in scholarship, policy, and practice are also offered.

        <title>Meta-mathematical aspects of definitions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The notion of definition is a central building block of mathematics. In addition to specific definitions, it is desirable that students learn about meta-mathematical aspects of definitions such as their role of classification, and about characteristics of definitions such as arbitrariness. We investigated how such meta-mathematical aspects emerge when students are led to construct a definition such as point of inflection or tangent line, and how the constructing process interacts with meta-mathematical aspects. We used Abstraction in Context as theoretical framework because of its suitability to analyze processes of knowledge construction. We found that meta-mathematical aspects of definitions influence and are influenced by students’ processes of constructing definitions. We argue that awareness of meta-mathematical aspects improves students’ conception of mathematical definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The racial role of mathematicians and mathematics in maintaining the Israeli military occupation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This essay focuses on the role of mathematics and Israeli mathematicians in serving the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, since 1967. It analyzes recently de-classified Israeli archival documents from the period 1967–1969, including minutes of ministerial meetings that discussed how to control the newly conquered people and land as discussed by Shafer Raviv (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of Contemporary History&lt;/em&gt;, 55(1), 161–181, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r29&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Middle Eastern Studies&lt;/em&gt;, 57(2), 342–356, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r30&quot;&gt;2021&lt;/span&gt;) as well as mathematical formulas created 40 years later as part of an Israeli policy to restrict food supplies to the Gaza Strip. It sheds light on the way in which mathematicians and mathematics can be employed to maintain and justify a racialized system of control. Drawing on Bonilla-Silva’s (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;American Sociological Review&lt;/em&gt;, 62(3), 465–480, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r7&quot;&gt;1997&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Journal of Political Ideologies&lt;/em&gt;, 8(1), 63–82, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r8&quot;&gt;2003&lt;/span&gt;) racialized social systems approach, the essay argues that mathematics and mathematicians professionalize and legitimize the dominant racial discourse in the Israeli military which, in turn, shapes the social and racial discourse in Israeli society that privileges Israeli Jews over Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The professional identities of prospective mathematics teachers who teach through programming</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As has been the case in many countries around the world, the new Norwegian curriculum from 2020 included programming as part of mathematics education. However, little is known about how prospective teachers perceive this addition in regard to their developing professional identities. When the results from an electronic survey of 394 prospective teachers showed unexpected findings, five of the subjects were asked to participate in a focus group interview in order to explore some of these results. The focus group interview was conducted to understand how prospective teachers considered the past, present and future aspects of their professional identities as teachers of mathematics through programming. The results reveal that, although the prospective teachers had little experience of programming, they were positive regarding its implementation in mathematics lessons because they identified themselves as digital natives; they therefore believed that learning to program would be easy. They aligned themselves with their students, as masters of technology, in contrast to their future colleagues, whom they implicitly described as digital immigrants. The findings of this study have implications for teacher education. Even if the prospective teachers have a positive attitude toward programming and consider themselves digitally competent, a limited understanding of how programming can be integrated into their mathematics teaching will affect the identities that they see for themselves as teachers who teach mathematics through programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shifts in student attention on algorithmic and creative practice tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In mathematics classrooms, it is common practice to work through a series of comparable tasks provided in a textbook. A central question in mathematics education is if tasks should be accompanied with solution methods, or if students should construct the solutions themselves. To explore the impact of these two task designs on student behavior during repetitive practice, an eye-tracking study was conducted with 50 upper secondary and university students. Their eye movements were analyzed to study how the two groups shifted their gaze both within and across 10 task sets. The results show that when a solution method was present, the students reread this every time they solved the task, while only giving minute attention to the illustration that carried information supporting mathematical understanding. Students who practiced with tasks without a solution method seemed to construct a solution method by observing the illustration, which later could be retrieved from memory, making this method more efficient in the long run. We discuss the implications for teaching and how tasks without solution methods can increase student focus on important mathematical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black Educators’ Racial Identity Attitudes and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: A Psychological Framework and Survey of Within-Race Diversity</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Historically, Black educators have played a critical role in Black youth&#39;s well-being. Consequently, they are often assumed to “naturally” engage culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), obscuring the diverse ways Black individuals identify, think, and behave regarding race and culture. This psychological survey study examines in-service Black educators’ (N = 238) multidimensional racial identity attitudes, background sociodemographics, and education contexts (postsecondary and current/teaching) in relation to their varied enactments of three CRP domains (African American Curriculum, Culturally Relevant Teaching, Sociopolitical Commitment). Results show CRP variation across individuals according to their racial identity attitudes, backgrounds, and contexts. The resulting conceptual framework advances research and discourse on teacher race by challenging homogenizing, detrimental narratives. Findings have important implications for teacher workforce diversification, training, and retention.

        <title>Transportation Inequities and School Choice: How Car, Public Transit, and School Bus Access Affect Families’ Options</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines how the student transportation options available to families affect which schools are accessible to them in a choice-based setting. The study has two parts. First, we compare commute times by foot, public transit, school bus, and car. We show that providing school bus service reduces commute times and improves access for families without cars, but access to a car fundamentally shapes families’ options. Second, we explore the relationship between neighborhood-level measures of vehicle access and families’ school requests and placements. Car access is strongly associated with school requests and placements even after accounting for neighborhood characteristics. We consider car access as a pathway by which wealth disparities produce educational disparities in settings that emphasize school choice.

        <title>Effects of Behaviour Change Communication on Knowledge and Prevention of Malaria Among Women in Ghana</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Behaviour change communication (BCC) remains a central component of the interventions used in the fight against malaria in Ghana. However, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness. This study evaluated the effects of BCC strategies on knowledge (symptoms, causes and prevention) and overall knowledge of malaria among Ghanaian women aged 15–49 years. The propensity score matching (PSM) approach and logistic regression were used to analyse data from the 2016 edition of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). Women who participated in community-level education or heard/saw media messages on malaria, or both, had significantly more knowledge of the disease than women who lacked access to any of these mediums of communication. The effect of these strategies on women’s overall knowledge of malaria is about 2% to 4% and is higher on their knowledge of the symptoms (3% to 6%) and prevention (2% to 4%) than the causes (2%). The combined effects of both mediums of communication are relatively higher than the effect of either of them as a single medium of communication. Further analysis showed that improved knowledge of the disease is associated with higher preventive measures taken by women for themselves and for their children. The results are more significant in rural and poor households than in urban and non-poor households. These findings underscore the need for the Ministry of Health and its partner institutions to adopt an innovative approach which combines the two strategies in intensively educating Ghanaians, and women in particular, on the symptoms and prevention of malaria, giving due cognisance to households’ socioeconomic status and geographical location.

        <title>Teacher-Designed Mathematical Portfolio Assessments: Motivations, Potential Benefits, and Lessons Learned</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In order to identify the potential benefits and challenges of implementing student portfolios as quality mathematics assessment, a pilot study was conducted with teachers in various secondary school settings. The multi-case study consisted of five teacher participants from geographically and demographically differing contexts, four in the USA and one in Canada. They were interviewed and surveyed, exploring their motivations for utilizing a portfolio system of mathematics assessment for the 2020–2021 school year, the design of their portfolio system, and resultant impacts on student dispositions around mathematics. Each participating teacher implemented different structures of portfolio assessment, including the types of items included and how the items were assessed. Results showed that compared to traditional multiple-choice tests, teachers felt portfolios were a better reflection of their students’ “extra-mathematical” skills, such as problem-solving and persistence. Teacher surveys and interviews also demonstrated confidence that the use of portfolios as assessment was superior to more traditional measures in terms of adhering to good pedagogical practices. Through questionnaire data and interviews, teachers reported portfolios were particularly beneficial for students for whom English is not their primary language, as well as students with special needs. The paper lays the groundwork for additional research studies in the area of student mathematics portfolios based on the provided framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring stakeholders’ sensemaking of the STEA“M” education policy in South Korea</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In 2011, South Korea introduced the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education policy in line with the worldwide emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This study aims to examine the perspectives of the stakeholders involved in the implementation of the STEAM education policy. To accomplish this, a qualitative research design was utilized, and inductive analysis was employed to collect and interpret the viewpoints of 13 stakeholders. These stakeholders encompassed policymakers, national institution directors, regional supervisors, administrators, principals, STEAM lead teachers, and mathematics teachers who created the STEAM-based curriculum in South Korea. Our findings reveal conflicting perspectives among the stakeholders regarding STEAM education. Our analysis also suggests that stakeholders’ participation in STEAM education is discontinuous and driven by the policy wave. Several impediments faced by mathematics teachers were also recognized, including obstacles in aligning STEAM-incorporated mathematics instruction with assessments, inadequate financial and curriculum assistance, and complications within the school climate. We discuss potential components that could affect the success of STEAM education and the conditions necessary for its successful implementation: (1) the need for consensus on the level of policy support; (2) the need for sustainable policy support; and (3) the need for policymakers’ consideration to connect the STEAM education policy with real mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Facilitating factors and obstacles in the coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates of probability</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates is challenging in probability teaching and learning. Modeling is one of the ways of teaching and learning that facilitates inquiry between these two perspectives. Given that, we designed a modeling activity to support fifteen secondary students in investigating theoretical probabilities, relative frequencies, and the corresponding relationship and in estimating the true probability. We analyzed how the design of a modeling activity can afford students’ coordination of the two probability perspectives and the difficulties in the process. This analysis shows that adopting an asymmetric random process and having students extend their models of a simple event to a compound event are helpful for students to coordinate probability perspectives. However, potential obstacles to coordination include an authority issue and statistical bias.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Front End of the STEM Teacher Pipeline: Early-Career STEM Teachers’ Field Experiences and Perceptions of Preparation</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;A growing quantitative literature finds evidence that student teaching placements predict later outcomes of teacher candidates and their students, but there is little large-scale quantitative evidence about the mechanisms for these estimated relationships. We used data from a survey of STEM teachers in Washington State to better understand how their perceptions of preparation were related to student teaching placements and current classroom environment. We found evidence that the composition of students in student teaching classrooms was predictive of STEM teachers’ perceptions of their preparation. For example, STEM teachers who student taught in classrooms with more English language learners and economically disadvantaged students reported feeling prepared to teach these specific student populations. Likewise, STEM teachers who student taught in high-poverty classrooms tended to report feeling better prepared to manage their current classroom, particularly if they were currently teaching in a high-poverty classroom.
