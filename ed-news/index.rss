        <title>Trends in mathematics education and insights from a meta-review and bibliometric analysis of review studies</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Review studies are vital for advancing knowledge in many scientific fields, including mathematics education, amid burgeoning publications. Based on an extensive consideration of existing review typologies, we conducted a meta-review and bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of and deeper insights into review studies within mathematics education. After searching Web of Science, we identified 259 review studies, revealing a significant increase in such studies over the last five years. Systematic reviews were the most prevalent type, followed by meta-analyses, generic literature reviews, and scoping reviews. On average, the review studies had a sample size of 99, with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines commonly employed. Despite certain studies offering nuanced distinctions among review types, ambiguity persisted. Only about a quarter of the studies explicitly reported employing specific theoretical frameworks (particularly, technology, knowledge, and competence models). Co-authored publications were most common within American institutions and the leading countries are the United States, Germany, China, Australia, and England in publishing most review studies. Educational review journals, educational psychology journals, special education journals, educational technology journals, and mathematics education journals provided platforms for review studies, and prominent research topics included digital technologies, teacher education, mathematics achievement, and learning disabilities. In this study, we synthesised a range of reviews to facilitate readers’ comprehension of conceptual congruities and disparities across various review types, as well as to track current research trends. The results suggest that there is a need for discipline-specific standards and guidelines for different types of mathematics education reviews, which may lead to more high-quality review studies to enhance progress in mathematics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cultivating mindfulness through conditional tasks in mathematics classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Following psychologist Langer’s theory, this study aimed to examine the influence of conditional tasks containing inherent uncertainty on the cultivation of mindfulness. It used preceding research to develop conditional mathematics tasks corresponding to integers and rational numbers, within a 10-lesson curriculum. It divided a total of 182 middle school students in South Korea into three groups: a control group (49 participants), experimental group 1 (62 participants), and experimental group 2 (71 participants). During each of the 10 lessons, experimental group 1 was given a conditional task, while experimental group 2 received 3–4 conditional tasks. Mindfulness was measured before and after the 10 lessons, and a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted. This study’s results revealed that the average scores of the subfactors of mindfulness—novelty seeking and flexibility—increased for both the experimental groups (1 and 2), but decreased for the control group. These findings empirically demonstrate the significance of conditional tasks with inherent uncertainty, in influencing students’ psychological state.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Actualizing the virtuality of the cauchy-riemann equations</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this case study we explored how a mathematician’s teaching of the Cauchy-Riemann (CR) equations actualized the virtual aspects of the equations. Using videotaped classroom data, we found that in a three-day period, this mathematician used embodiment to animate and bind formal aspects of the CR equations (including conformality), metaphors, himself, and his students. We found that the mathematician’s creative introduction of matrices led to a discussion of transformations which made the CR equations mobile and hence gave him a space to virtualize the CR equations. In our results we summarize how the mathematician&#39;s assemblage of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;unusual&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;unexpected, and unscripted&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;without given content&lt;/em&gt; creative acts with materials embedded in algebraic and geometric inscriptions and metaphors &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;introduced or catalyzed the new&lt;/em&gt;—the virtuality of the CR equations. In our discussion, we highlight how the mathematician bridged the virtual with the abstract via his conceptualizations of the CR equations. Didactic implications include adopting the mathematician’s conceptualizations and asking students to bind them. This could stress the mobility of conformal maps which are generally not taught in an undergraduate class. We propose offering professional development for educators focused on learning how to engineer didactic practices that showcase mobility, support binding, and exhibit animation of mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Towards a definition of “mathematical digital competency for teaching”</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When students engage with a digital tool to tackle a mathematical task, the interplay between their digital competencies and mathematical abilities gives rise to what is termed mathematical digital competency (MDC). Recognising the significance of MDC as an integral component for contemporary students, the relevance of cultivating mathematical digital competency for teaching (MDCT) becomes apparent. We posit that for teachers to effectively guide students in the development of their MDC, possessing MDCT is imperative. In this paper, drawing upon the theoretical frameworks of instrumental orchestration, the documentational approach to didactics, and the Danish competencies framework’s six didactico-pedagogical competencies of mathematics teachers, we propose a theoretical conceptualization of teachers’ mathematical and digital competencies in the context of teaching mathematics with technology. Expanding upon the preliminary definition of students’ MDC, we incorporate pedagogic, theoretical elements tailored to teachers, encapsulating it as MDCT. To expound on the various facets of MDCT, we provide an illustrative example featuring a mathematics teacher proficient in the utilisation of digital technologies and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Probabilistic literacy and reasoning of prospective secondary school teachers when interpreting media news</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Educating students to apply probability literacy and reasoning in out-of-school contexts requires the previous preparation of teachers, which should include the assessment of their mathematical and didactic knowledge. Consequently, we investigated three research questions concerning the probabilistic reasoning and literacy of 66 prospective secondary school teachers when solving probability questions related to a report taken from the media news, their ability to identify the fundamental stochastic ideas needed to solve the task, and their capacity to predict their students’ potential difficulties. The participants needed to compute the probability of a complementary event, several conditional probabilities, and perform critical reading of the information in the report. Despite the participants’ good mathematical knowledge, a high percentage showed reasoning biases, such as the fallacy of the transposed conditional, confusion between conditioning and causation, and few identified the information missing to solve a question. There was a poor capacity to determine the stochastic ideas needed to solve the questions, beyond probability, sample space, conditional probability, and sampling. The participants quoted a few potential errors of their students, mainly conceptual mistakes with scarce recognition of interpretation errors. These results reveal the need to reinforce teachers’ probabilistic literacy, reasoning, and related didactic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Math Ed Majors: Golf Edition (Part I)</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this article is to identify, from the plethora of journals dedicated to publishing research in the field of mathematics education, in general, and from mathematics education’s ‘Group of Seven’, in particular, what I call the Math Ed Majors. In order to do so, I look to men’s professional golf, and men’s major golf championships. Worthy of note, there are only four majors in men’s professional golf. As such, I pronounce only four journals as math ed majors. Recognizing that I may ruffle some feathers, I take into consideration, as has been done in men’s golf, scenarios where there are only three or perhaps five majors. Also taking into consideration that I am constantly on the lookout for and have a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters, because if Canadian mathematics education matters then Canadian mathematics education matters, I provide an honourable mention by drawing parallels between a prominent journal and the Canadian Open. After a bit of translation, necessary for a brief aside where I speak Canadian, I allude to Part II of this manuscript, proclaiming the Math Ed Majors with the explicit purpose of introducing brand-new, unconventional, professional golf–based author productivity indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do Teacher Job Postings Tell Us About School Hiring Needs and Equity?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While decades of research document inequity in the distribution of teachers across schools, few studies consider the distribution of teacher vacancies and other school hiring needs. We use teacher job postings, a direct proxy of school hiring needs, to document how these hiring needs vary across districts, schools, and subject areas. We first validate job postings as an indicator of school hiring needs by showing that filled postings closely line up with eventual teacher hires. We then show that schools serving more students of color had greater hiring needs throughout the year and that hiring needs for special education and science, technology, engineering, and math positions were considerably higher than for elementary positions according to both the number and duration of job postings.

        <title>Artificial Intelligence and Educational Measurement: Opportunities and Threats</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;I review opportunities and threats that widely accessible Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered services present for educational statistics and measurement. Algorithmic and computational advances continue to improve approaches to item generation, scale maintenance, test security, test scoring, and score reporting. Predictable misuses of AI for these purposes will result in biased scores, construct underrepresentation, and differential impact over time. Recent efforts to develop standards for AI use in testing like those of Burstein are promising. I argue that similar efforts to develop AI standards for educational measurement will benefit from increased attention to the context of test use and explicit commitment to ongoing monitoring of bias and scale drift over time.

        <title>Using Permutation Tests to Identify Statistically Sound and Nonredundant Sequential Patterns in Educational Event Sequences</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Frequent sequential pattern mining is a valuable technique for capturing the relative arrangement of learning events, but current algorithms often return excessive learning event patterns, many of which may be noise or redundant. These issues exacerbate researchers’ burden when interpreting the patterns to derive actionable insights into learning processes. This study proposed permutation tests for identifying sequential patterns whose occurrences are statistically significantly greater than the chance value and different from their superpatterns. Simulations demonstrated that the test for detecting sound patterns had a low false discovery rate and high power, while the test for detecting nonredundant patterns also showed a high accuracy. Empirical data analyses found that the patterns detected in training data were generalizable to test data.

        <title>Towards right to work: A reflexive analysis on an action research</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article explores the potential of action research by evaluating the research process, methodological nuances and experiential learnings of an action researcher involved in the action research conducted at Dudhera, a rural village in India on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). It documents the struggles and resistance of MGNREGA workers of Dudhera. They came together and decided to claim rights under MGNREGA when they felt powerless and starved - of both information and influence over the key decisions that affected their lives. The article critically examines the implementation failure of MGNREGA and the malpractices perpetuated by the Panchayat. It also portrays the community’s determination to bring change by claiming their right and challenging the status quo. The article also presents a reflexive analysis of action research, including the role of action researcher, community engagement and subjective transformation of both self and community in the action research process. The article advances knowledge about participatory action research and its potential for transformative change.

        <title>The meaning landscape of the concept of the total derivative in multivariable real analysis textbooks: an analysis based on a new model of meaning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework tailored for modeling the meaning of mathematical concepts in university-level mathematics, addressing their rigorous nature and their relationships with related concepts as well as interpretations in various contexts. Within this framework, we present a model of meaning for the concepts of total differentiability and total derivative that provides a variety of possible interpretations and aspects. We then use the proposed model of meaning as a tool for analyzing three different textbooks for mathematics majors on the topic of multidimensional differentiability. ﻿Our paper is an example of a subject matter analysis of a topic in university mathematics carried out in a structured way. The model of meaning for total differentiability presented in this paper could inspire course design and analysis including the design of assignments and assessments for students. Moreover, it could serve as a valuable research tool for further analyses. For example, it could be used as a framework for analyzing courses taught or as a basis for developing a test instrument to assess students’ understanding. With our textbook analysis, we begin to examine the landscape of textbooks regarding differentiability concepts in the multidimensional case, shedding light on the diversity of meaning facets that are covered in the textbooks. These results could be useful for guiding instructors and learners in selecting and using textbooks for teaching and learning based on their respective needs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A mixed method quasi-experimental study on transforming preservice teachers’ mathematics anxiety and teaching self-efficacy beliefs</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The main purpose of this study was to explore the effects of two college-level mathematics courses on preservice elementary teachers’ mathematics anxiety and mathematics teaching self-efficacy beliefs. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was implemented on two college-level mandatory mathematics teaching methods courses that were specifically designed based on Bandura’s (1977) self-efficacy expectations theory. The findings of the study revealed a statistically significant difference between the beliefs of participants in the control and intervention groups for mathematics teaching self-efficacy after the intervention process, and a statistically significant change was found on the preservice elementary teachers’ mathematics anxiety and mathematics teaching self-efficacy beliefs within the intervention group. Moreover, qualitative exploration revealed the important aspects of this change as being pedagogical and emotional transformation, in which the intervention process helped the preservice teachers to develop a positive attitude and a better understanding towards mathematics and its teaching. Creation of discussions around preservice teachers’ previous mathematics related experiences and helping preservice teachers to succeed at challenging mathematical tasks could help teacher educators design more effective mathematics teaching courses on decreasing mathematics anxiety and increasing mathematics teaching self-efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Profiling Teachers’ Motivation for Professional Development: A Nationwide Study</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Situated in the context of advanced placement (AP) reform in the United States, we investigated profiles of teachers’ motivation for participating in professional development (PD) courses in a two-cohort sample of nt1 = 2,369 and nt2 = 2,170 chemistry teachers via multilevel latent class analysis. In addition, the study investigated to what extent profile membership was related to factors at the teacher, school, and PD levels. Participation in PD courses was associated with one of three profiles, labeled “reform-motivated,” “convenience-motivated,” and “interaction-motivated.” Participation in PD courses was more likely to be reform-motivated if a teacher had a major in chemistry, more experience teaching AP, more positive attitudes toward PD, or higher enactment of AP redesign in the classroom, or if the PD course was formal and face-to-face. The results show that teachers have different motivations for participating in PD courses and provide insight into how to engage teachers in professional learning.

        <title>Future teachers’ reflections on mathematical errors made in their teaching practice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study answers the following research questions: 1) What types of mathematical errors do future teachers identify when they reflect on their practice? and 2) Which levels of development of the didactic suitability assessment competence for the “errors” component can be inferred when they reflect on their practice? To answer these questions, we explain the Didactic Suitability Criteria construct and describe the associated training cycle structure in the theoretical and methodological framework sections. We followed a qualitative research methodology that mainly consists of thematic analysis. The study conducted allows finding inductive categories of types of mathematical errors, such as error in the task instructions, error of proposition, procedural error, error in the representation, error in the definition and error in the argument. It also enables establishing levels of development of the didactic suitability assessment competence of future teachers for the “errors” component. The main conclusion of this research is the importance of the context to decide what a mathematical error is. The need to further examine the notion of mathematical error in the training of future mathematics teachers is also stressed. Another conclusion is the development of a rubric that allows for more accurate and deeper reflections of future teachers on the errors made.&lt;/p&gt;
