        <title>Moving beyond the ‘budget dance’</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 48-52, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The annual budgeting process is a valuable opportunity for districts to systematically examine both resource use and programming. They can then use the findings to optimize resource use and improve program efficacy in ways that will lead to increased student achievement. Bo Yan and Thomas Aberli discuss three root causes for districts’ inability to accomplish the goals (reliance on problem-driven needs as the dominant factor of budgetary decisions, disconnect between financial management and performance management, as well as human nature). They propose a cycle-based approach to district budgeting that rests on differentiating investment from operation expenditures.

        <title>Letting go of what doesn’t work in education: A conversation with Rick Ginsberg and Yong Zhao</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 38-41, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Rick Ginsberg and Yong Zhao want educators to question the status quo and clear out ineffective practices to make room for K-12 reforms that work. Their 2023 book, Duck and Cover: Confronting Dubious Practices in Education, Ginsberg and Zhao examine kindergarten readiness, college- and career-readiness, reading proficiency by 3rd grade, social and emotional learning, education technology, class size, dress codes, state standardized testing, meta-analysis, and more.

        <title>Parents’ rights, yes. But parent responsibilities, too</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 53-57, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;While there are plenty of people who decry the parents’ right push, viewing it as manufactured and mean-spirited, Frederick M. Hess and Michael Q. McShane think it has been a healthy and overdue development. Yet while parents have rights, they also have a responsibility to send students to school ready to learn. Schools are ultimately reliant on parents being active partners in preparing their children to be responsible students and citizens. With clear communication and a willingness to listen, families and schools can form more productive partnerships to help students learn.

        <title>What a study of educator evaluation taught us about professional learning</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-46, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;After years evaluating teacher professional learning programs, researchers Andrew J. Wayne, Jordan Rickles, Mengli Song, Seth Brown, and Michael S. Garet describe a study that changed their perspective. The study’s takeaways about the design of teacher professional learning are important for everyone who seeks to create systems to support teaching and learning. The findings call attention to the value of streamlined, high-quality programs for improving performance outcomes for teachers and students.

        <title>Changes that stick</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-11, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Many education leaders may wonder how to implement sustainable policy changes that will benefit youth, families, and the community. Arielle Lentz, Laura Desimone, Amy Stornaiuolo, Katie Pak, Nelson Flores, Philip Nichols, Morgan Polikoff, and Andy Porter share findings from school change efforts in more than 170 districts in five states. They present six key strategies based on this work, and they share examples of how districts employed the success factors of specificity, consistency, power, and stability to help build authority, which in turn led to successful implementation of new policies, curriculums, and professional learnings.

        <title>Changing the school system improvement narrative</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 12-17, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Districts are struggling to accelerate students’ learning, support their health and wellness, and close the achievement gap. Labeled “worst” in 1987, by 2017 Chicago Public Schools was among the nation’s most improved school systems. Chicago’s story embeds many lessons about system change. Sharon Greenberg and Anthony S. Bryk illustrate how local research evidence helped leaders target a few high-leverage processes and informed their ongoing efforts to improve outcomes. Achieving quality enactment of these processes at scale depended on building capacity, which, in turn, took time.

        <title>Big problems require big solutions</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 26-31, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;School leaders Lydia Cochrane and Ayesha Hoda have struggled to meet the increasingly complex needs of the students in their schools. As students’ needs increase, schools are asked to do more and more, while continuing to have strong academic results. Cochrane and Hoda believe the current system is untenable and needs to change. With Linda Nathan, they share a possible model schedule that could allow schools to meet more of students’ needs and describe schools that have experimented with alternate structures.

        <title>Classroom communities for everyone</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 32-37, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;As people with power in schools, teachers and administrators make instructional decisions that shape opportunities in classrooms for students to learn. Educators’ words and actions, especially related to the treatment of students and their ideas, are foundational for creating equitable learning communities in our classrooms and schools. David Stroupe, Lindsay Berk, and Anna Kramer examine the creation and growth of learning communities through a particular lens of inequity: epistemic injustice. Briefly, epistemic injustice is a philosophical perspective that deals with inequities associated with knowledge and knowledge production practices. The authors provide concrete examples from two classrooms in which the teachers actively disrupt epistemic injustice.

        <title>Instructional design for innovation and reform</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 18-25, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Not enough attention is paid to the instructional design decisions that define students’ experiences. Lisa Dover Kingsley and Jennifer Perry Cheatham contend that while quality teaching is crucial, the structural decisions supporting meaningful engagement often go unexamined. Using innovations in North Kansas City, Missouri, as a throughline, they review key themes present in research on four elements of instructional design. They urge leaders to reconsider outdated and unexamined design practices with an equitable approach, centering the voices of students typically left out of such decisions. They offer practical shifts and entry points for leaders to consider as they build a more inclusive and effective instructional design.

        <title>Poll Points: What does the public think about expanding time in school?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 72-72, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The PDK poll shows that a majority of Americans would support expanding the amount of time students spend in school, with more Americans preferring longer school years to longer school days. This infographic shows how the data breaks down by race, region, and type of community.

        <title>The Editor’s Note: Change for the change-averse</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Many people who resist change are actually resisting changes that don’t make a difference but only pile on more work. Teresa Preston, editor-in-chief of Kappan, previews the March issue of Kappan, which focuses on how education leaders can make changes that have value.

        <title>Policy Solutions: We need a school board election holiday</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-61, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Voter turnout for school board elections is historically low, with tiny percentages deciding who governs schools. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins proposes a new federal holiday, School Board Election Day, to increase voter turnout and public involvement and interest in public schools. School board elections would be held on the same day nationally, and voters would be encouraged to visit schools not only to vote but to participate in forums and projects to benefit schools.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-59, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;PDK CEO James F. Lane talks with Shaun Nelms, former superintendent of Rochester Public Schools, about his work building a partnership between East High School in Rochester, New York, and the University of Rochester to turn around a high school on the brink of closure. Nelms discusses the importance of involving the community in transformation and building on success over time. Now at the University of Rochester, he hopes to help strengthen connections between preK-12 and higher education. Additionally, he is the CEO of the Nelms Consulting Group, where he provides expertise and guidance on creating equitable school systems and effective administrative leadership.

        <title>Under The Law: Recent developments in the quest for racial diversity in K-12 schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In June 2023, the Supreme Court held that the admissions systems at the University of North Carolina (UNC) and Harvard University were racially discriminatory, effectively ending affirmative action. Are race-neutral admissions policies at selective K-12 schools next? Bob Kim considers two circuit court cases — Coalition for TJ v. Fairfax County School Board and Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence v. City of Boston — in which plaintiffs alleged that schools’ race-neutral admissions policies were discriminatory against Asian American students. In both cases, courts found that the cases were not discriminatory. Although how the Supreme Court might rule if it hears these cases is unclear, the bar for finding policies discriminatory is high, requiring not only a desire to increase diversity but also an intent to harm a particular racial group.

        <title>Backtalk: Academic jargon and the illusion of objectivity</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/6&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 6&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, March 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Although some people view quantitative studies as more legitimate than qualitative studies, both methods are subject to bias, Iris Rotberg explains. The study’s methodological strengths and weaknesses are determined when researchers frame questions, choose samples and outcome measures, and collect data. These design decisions and their implementation are far more important determinants of research validity than are the subsequent data analyses, whether quantitative or qualitative.

        <title>Conceptions of span in linear algebra: from textbook examples to student responses</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Using Balacheff’s (2013) model of conceptions, we inferred potential conceptions in three examples presented in the spanning sets section of an interactive linear algebra textbook. An analysis of student responses to two similar reading questions revealed additional strategies that students used to decide whether a vector was in the spanning set of a given set of vectors. An analysis of the correctness of the application of these strategies provides a more nuanced understanding of student responses that might be more useful for instructors than simply classifying the responses as right or wrong. These findings add to our knowledge of the textbook’s presentation of span and student understanding of span. We discuss implications for research and practice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning analytics in mathematics education: the case of feedback use in a digital classification task on reflective symmetry</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Learning Analytics is concerned with the use of data collected in educational settings to support learning processes. We take a Learning Analytics approach to study the use of immediate feedback in digital classification tasks in mathematics. Feedback serves as an opportunity for learning, however its mere existence does not guarantee its use and effectiveness, as what matters is how learners interact with it. Therefore, our research questions are focused on that interaction. The data consisted of 266 object movements for classifying polygons, and 524 shape movements for classifying traffic signs, under the topic of symmetry. Participants included 29 elementary school students (9–12 years old) from Israel and Germany. Analyzing students’ success, feedback use, and the associations between them, we demonstrate how not acting upon feedback is negatively associated with success, and how this undesired behavior slightly reduces along the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
