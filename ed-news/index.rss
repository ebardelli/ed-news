        <title>Combined use of the extended theory of connections and the onto-semiotic approach to analyze mathematical connections by relating the graphs of f and f’</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The literature reports that students have difficulties connecting different meanings, multiple representations of the derivative, and performing reversibility processes between representations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f’&lt;/em&gt;. The research goal is to analyze the mathematical connections that university students establish when solving tasks that involve the graphs of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f’&lt;/em&gt; when the two functions do not have associated symbolic expressions. Seven students from the first year of undergraduate studies in mathematics from a university in southern Mexico participated. For data collection, two tasks involving the graphical context of the derivative were applied. An analysis of the mathematical activity was carried out by the participants with the analysis model proposed by the onto-semiotic approach, and thematic analysis with types of mathematical connections from the extended theory of connections was carried out to infer the connections made in that mathematical activity, which allowed us to consider the reversibility connection between the graphs of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f’&lt;/em&gt; as the encapsulation of a portion of the mathematical activity. Four students establish the reversibility relationship between the graph of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and the graph of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f’&lt;/em&gt;. It has been concluded that some students can establish the reversibility connection between the graphs of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;f’&lt;/em&gt;, but the complexity of the mathematical activity that encapsulates the connection explains (by showing everything that the student must do) why some students are not able to establish it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preservice English Teachers’ Preparedness to Teach: Stakeholders’ Perceptions in Teaching Practicum</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Preservice English language teachers (PSTs) realize and shape their perceptions regarding preparedness to teach during their education. However, being prepared to teach is complex and multifaceted and requires individual factors and interaction with context and other people. Therefore, understanding it from stakeholders’ lens is needed. Within a descriptive and exploratory design, one-on-one, semistructured interviews were conducted with 8 faculty advisors (FAs) and 11 cooperating teachers (CTs) supervising PSTs in primary, secondary, and high schools in a northwestern city in Türkiye. The data collected in teaching practicum stage of field experience was coded and categorized via constant comparison method of analysis. The FAs, except for few issues, regarded the PSTs as unprepared to teach, while the CTs did as prepared to teach. The emergence of a perception gap could show lack of common understanding and mismatch between the stakeholders’ perceptions regarding their standards of and approaches toward high-quality teacher preparation.

        <title>Exploring Gender Differences in Leadership Aspirations: A Four-Year Longitudinal Study of College Students From Adverse Backgrounds</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The gender disparity in leadership positions is substantial and critical yet persists despite decades of focused study. Critical developmental periods, such as emerging adulthood, may be particularly relevant to attend to if we hope to find effective interventions to tackle this problem. The present study draws on longitudinal data covering four years of college among a socio-demographically and nationally diverse sample of college students with adverse backgrounds (N = 404) who enrolled at one of 182 four-year colleges or universities across the United States. Results indicate that female students enter college with significantly lower levels of leadership aspirations than their male counterparts. Once in college, despite greater likelihoods of participating in activities conceptualized as “leadership learning experiences,” female disadvantages persist. Overall, development experiences over four years of college had no discernable effect on gender disparities in leadership aspirations. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

        <title>Toward a Shared Conception of Children’s Content Area Identities in Literacy, Math, and Science: A Systematic Integrative Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The concept of identity has been used to interrogate a wide range of topics about children’s learning in the content areas, including learning in literacy, math, and science. Despite this, there is a paucity of attention to how the construct of identities is conceptualized across content areas. This systematic integrative review aims to develop an empirically grounded view of how identities are conceptualized in childhood across content areas and to consider the feasibility of a shared conception of content area identities. To do this, the review examines 66 articles on content area identities in early childhood and childhood (birth through Grade 5). Findings show diverse theories are used to examine content area identities in children and at the same time significant consensus in the underlying assumptions about what content area identities are and how they develop. These findings suggest that researchers move away from the current siloed approach to content area identity research and toward a more connected field of study.

        <title>Alternatives to Weighted Item Fit Statistics for Establishing Measurement Invariance in Many Groups</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Evaluating scale comparability in international large-scale assessments depends on measurement invariance (MI). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is a standard method for establishing MI in several programs, such as the Programme for International Student Assessment and the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies. Previous research showed that the RMSD was unable to detect departures from MI when the latent trait distribution was far from item difficulty. In this study, we developed three alternative approaches to the original RMSD: equal, item information, and b-norm weighted RMSDs. Specifically, we considered the item-centered normalized weight distributions to compute the item characteristic curve difference in the RMSD procedure more efficiently. We further compared all methods’ performance via a simulation study and the item information and b-norm weighted RMSDs showed the most promising results. An empirical example is demonstrated, and implications for researchers are discussed.

        <title>Exploring spherical units as perceptual clues in enumerating 3D arrays</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study continues an investigation of how spherical units, compared to cubical units, can facilitate students’ units-locating and organizing units in composites. We analyze how Norwegian grade 3 students enumerate 3D arrays with cubical and spherical units. Our results show how spherical units can act as perceptual clues that facilitate cognitive processes, underlying students’ strategies in the enumeration of 3D arrays. In particular, the results show how spherical units facilitate the units-locating process, which, in turn, supports processes of organizing-by-composites and spatial structuring of the array, in the action of developing a proper iterative strategy such as layer-based thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring the Mathematical Maturity of Students in an Academic Development Programme</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study focuses on students who are registered for the University of Pretoria’s academic development programme, the Four-year Programme (FYP). The programme was introduced as a gateway for students who are under-prepared but have the potential to succeed. This programme helps them to then continue their studies in mainstream science programmes. Our research focuses on measuring the change in the academic maturity of these students. In the theoretical framework that we developed, academic maturity is subdivided into two components, namely, non-subject based maturity, and subject based maturity (mathematical maturity). A mathematics test was also administered twice (at the beginning of the year and after the first semester) and was used to measure the subject based maturity of students. The results of the pre- and post-tests were compared to measure the improvement in students’ mathematical skills. The results showed that in all of the topics and constructs, there was an improvement in students’ mathematical abilities. The study also shows that students still struggle with the fundamentals of some mathematics topics, even after a semester of tuition in the FYP.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Representations of Mathematics Education in Swedish Newspapers—Part of the Structural Influence on Mathematics Teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is an ongoing public debate about mathematics education. This dialogue influences policymakers as well as mathematics teachers who are affected by these public ideas. Consequently, exploring the public debate, for example, by studying news media, is relevant for understanding teaching and learning in mathematics and also pertinent for researchers to actively participate in the debate about mathematics education. Representations of mathematics education, which emerged in a study of three national newspapers in Sweden, were explored. Articles relevant to the study were found in systematic searches in a media archive every fifth year between 1992 and 2017. Findings show that the construction of mathematics education in Swedish newspapers is multifaceted and complex, foregrounded by achievements, measurements and various forms of teaching. Other parts of the construction involve teachers wanting to arouse positive feelings, but their attempts are often unsuccessful. Whilst the construction of mathematics education is increasingly varied, the resulting positive and negative feelings and the tensions between representations contribute new insights, which are important to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Résumé&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;L’enseignement des mathématiques fait constamment l’objet d’un débat public. Cette discussion influence les décideurs politiques ainsi que les enseignants de mathématiques touchés par ces idées échangées dans le domaine public. Par conséquent, afin de comprendre l’enseignement et l’apprentissage des mathématiques, en plus de faciliter la participation active des chercheurs à la conversation portant sur l’enseignement des mathématiques, il est pertinent d’étudier ce débat public, par exemple en examinant les médias d’information. Ainsi, nous avons analysé les représentations faites de l’enseignement des mathématiques qui sont ressorties de l’examen de trois journaux nationaux en Suède. Des recherches systématiques effectuées dans des archives médiatiques tous les cinq ans entre 1992 et 2017 ont permis d’identifier des articles pertinents à cette étude. Les résultats montrent que la conception de l’enseignement des mathématiques dans les journaux suédois est multiforme et complexe, qu’elle met l’accent sur les réalisations, les évaluations et diverses formes d’enseignement. D’autres éléments incluent le fait que les enseignants veulent susciter des sentiments positifs, mais que leurs tentatives sont souvent infructueuses. L’accent placé sur les réalisations et les évaluations est conforme aux études antérieures menées au Canada; alors que la représentation de l’enseignement des mathématiques est de plus en plus variée, les sentiments positifs et négatifs qui en résultent, ainsi que les tensions entre les représentations, apportent de nouvelles perspectives, importantes pour le domaine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching to Fish: Impacts of a Social Capital Intervention for College Students</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Social capital plays a key role in college students’ academic and career success. Using a random assignment design, the current study evaluated the impacts of a one-credit college course designed to increase student help-seeking and social capital within a racially diverse sample of college students. Compared to the control group, students in the treatment group reported improved attitudes towards help-seeking, increased help-seeking behavior, and higher levels of social capital and mentoring support. Academic benefits were mixed, however, with an increase in academic self-efficacy, no impact on college GPA, and a decrease in academic cognitive engagement. Additionally, differential impacts based on year in college, race, and first-generation college student status were observed. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

        <title>Children engaging with partitive quotient tasks: elucidating qualitative heterogeneity within the Image Having layer of the Pirie–Kieren model</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The paper presents findings from a study that examined, through the lens of the Image Having layer of the Pirie–Kieren model, the qualitative characteristics of the images that different children formed when engaging with eight, novel partitive quotient tasks. The Image Having layer is the first point of abstraction within the Pirie–Kieren model. Therefore, this research is significant in aiming to advance theoretical insight into how the notion of child-created images relates to the development of children’s mathematical understanding, in the context of novel for them tasks. This study adopted a qualitative, microgenetic research design and involved nine Year 5 (aged 9–10 years) children. Data based on children’s verbal responses and jottings were collected through multiple trials over eight individual sessions with each child. Analysis of 72 interview transcripts showed that children formed and used a range of different images that varied across tasks but also within the same task. This study provides a nuanced description of qualitative distinctions in the nature of child-created images. It thus reveals varied dimensions of a dynamic process of knowledge development and sense-making. This highlights, for educators, the need to be aware of and adaptive to the varied and dynamic dimensions of knowledge that children draw from, when dealing with novel tasks, and which change as children’s understanding of new mathematical content develops.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Extending an Identified Four-Parameter IRT Model: The Confirmatory Set-4PNO Model</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Given the frequent presence of slipping and guessing in item responses, models for the inclusion of their effects are highly important. Unfortunately, the most common model for their inclusion, the four-parameter item response theory model, potentially has severe deficiencies related to its possible unidentifiability. With this issue in mind, the dyad four-parameter normal ogive (Dyad-4PNO) model was developed. This model allows for slipping and guessing effects by including binary augmented variables—each indicated by two items whose probabilities are determined by slipping and guessing parameters—which are subsequently related to a continuous latent trait through a two-parameter model. Furthermore, the Dyad-4PNO assumes uncertainty as to which items are paired on each augmented variable. In this way, the model is inherently exploratory. In the current article, the new model, called the Set-4PNO model, is an extension of the Dyad-4PNO in two ways. First, the new model allows for more than two items per augmented variable. Second, these item sets are assumed to be fixed, that is, the model is confirmatory. This article discusses this extension and introduces a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate the model. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows the efficacy of the algorithm at estimating the model parameters. A real data example shows that this extension may be viable in practice, with the data fitting a more general Set-4PNO model (i.e., more than two items per augmented variable) better than the Dyad-4PNO, 2PNO, 3PNO, and 4PNO models.

        <title>Post-Pandemic Onset Public School Enrollment and Mobility: Evidence From Virginia</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Public school enrollment dramatically decreased during the pandemic, but the patterns of decline and student movement across schools are not yet well understood. Using statewide student-level data from Virginia, we find pre-K–12 enrollment dropped by 4% between fall 2019 and the first post-pandemic fall of 2020. The changes were the largest in pre-kindergarten and kindergarten and explained mostly by decreases in new enrollees, though exits also increased. K–12 enrollment declines were the largest among White and economically-advantaged students (but largest for Black and economically-disadvantaged pre-kindergartners). We also observe a decline in school transfers (both within and between districts), concentrated among Black and economically-disadvantaged students and students with disabilities. Findings have implications for equity, school funding, and student well-being.

        <title>What motivates and demotivates Estonian mathematics teachers to continue teaching? The roles of self-efficacy, work satisfaction, and work experience</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Estonian students achieved high scores in the latest Programme for International Student Assessment surveys. At the same time, there needs to be more knowledge about the teachers guiding these students, as this could provide insights into effective teaching methods that can be replicated in other educational contexts. According to the Teaching and Learning International Survey, Estonian teachers&#39; average age is among the highest in the world, and the shortage of young, qualified mathematics teachers is well-documented. The present study aimed to map the motivating and demotivating factors for mathematics teachers to continue working in this profession. The effective sample comprised 164 Estonian mathematics teachers who responded to items regarding self-efficacy and job satisfaction and open-ended questions about motivating and demotivating factors regarding their work. The results showed that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;students&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;salary and vacation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;job environment &lt;/em&gt;are both motivating and demotivating for mathematics teachers. On the one hand, helping the students to succeed (and witnessing the progress), satisfying salaries and a good job climate motivate the teachers. And at the same time, students&#39; low motivation, poor salary, and straining work conditions (e.g., very high workload) serve as demotivating factors. We showed that mathematics teachers&#39; work experience is an essential factor to be considered when thinking about motivating and demotivating factors for teachers, as well as their self-efficacy and job satisfaction. The reasons, possible impact, and potential interventions on an educational policy level are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading and Writing Relations Are Not Uniform: They Differ by the Linguistic Grain Size, Developmental Phase, and Measurement</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate reading-writing relations. Beyond the overall relation, we systematically investigated moderation of the relation as a function of linguistic grain size (word reading and spelling versus reading comprehension and written composition), measurement of reading comprehension (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended, cloze), and written composition (e.g., writing quality, writing productivity, writing fluency, writing syntax), and developmental phase of reading and writing (grade levels as a proxy). A total of 395 studies (k = 2,265, N = 120,669) met inclusion criteria. Overall, reading and writing were strongly related (r = .72). However, the relation differed depending on the subskills of reading and writing such that word reading and spelling were strongly related (r =.82) whereas reading comprehension and written composition were moderately related (r =.44). In addition, the word reading-spelling relation was stronger for primary-grade students (r =.82) than for university students/adults (r =.69). The relation of reading comprehension with written composition differed depending on measurement of reading comprehension and written composition—reading comprehension measured by multiple choice and open-ended tasks had a stronger relation with writing quality than reading comprehension measured by oral retell tasks; and reading comprehension had moderate relations with writing quality, writing vocabulary, writing syntax, and writing conventions but had weak relations with writing productivity and writing fluency. Relations tended to be stronger when reliability was higher, and the relation between word reading and spelling was stronger for alphabetic languages (r = .83) than for Chinese (r = .71). These results add important nuances about the nature of relations between reading and writing.

        <title>Moving Toward Integration or Segregation? Racial Change in Suburban Public Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Suburbs across the US are experiencing demographic shifts with consequences for suburban schools. While scholars have expressed concern about rising segregation among suburban public schools, we extend this work by examining changes in racial/ethnic school segregation across a typology of suburban municipalities in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin metropolitan area between 2007 and 2018. Our findings are mixed- contingent on the measure of segregation employed. We find that Black-white and Hispanic-white segregation in mature suburbs is rising, but is at least in part driven by shifting demographics. The results suggest intra-suburban variation in segregation, highlighting the connection between race and neighborhood change.
