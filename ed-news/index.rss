        <title>Measuring the Efficacy of Zearn Math in Louisiana</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines the impact of an online math learning program on third through fifth grade math achievement in Louisiana. Employing Zearn Math usage metrics and administrative data from the Louisiana Department of Education, the results indicate that grade levels that programmatically used Zearn Math scored, on average, about .03 standard deviation units higher on Louisiana’s statewide math assessment. A placebo test using English-language arts scores and several robustness checks suggests that this may be an underestimate of the true effect. These findings come at a crucial time because pandemic-related school closures have led to a 20-fold increase in public school spending on Zearn-related materials between July 2019 and July 2021, and its presence continues to expand across the nation.

        <title>What do adults know about public education?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-14, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Adults’ beliefs and knowledge about the state of the U.S. education system drive decisions about policy, funding, program adoption, student participation in programs, and the selection of decision makers to elected positions. Amie Rapaport and Anna Rosefsky Saavedra share national survey data showing that U.S. adults have little knowledge about what is being taught in schools, express neutrality about belief systems undergirding education policy, and report experiences misaligned with hard-data trends on student academic progress in recent years. With adults reporting they learn about issues crucial to our education system mainly from “personal experience,” better information has the potential to improve U.S. education.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Pandemic recovery will depend on political rediscovery</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-53, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The current culture wars have been showing up in schools and districts, making local school board races increasingly partisan. The 2024 presidential race is placing even more attention on the partisan divide in local education policies and decisions. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins writes that education advocates can leverage this focus and help put aside partisan politics and meet the post-pandemic challenges students face.

        <title>Under the Law: Title IX and the SCOTUS power grab</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 54-55, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;New Title IX regulations issued by the Department of Education expand the types of sexual harassment schools must address and give schools greater flexibility in how they handle hearings. But the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo expands courts’ roles in how federal agencies interpret and enforce regulations like Title IX. Robert Kim considers how the Loper Bright ruling might affect Title IX.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-64, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Looking to the election in November, 54% of Americans say public education will be extremely or very important to their vote; 44% say it’ll be somewhat or not at all important. Among public school parents, more, 70%, say education will be important in their vote for president.

        <title>Making mathematics visible through narrative</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 38-43, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The latest content and practice standards for mathematics have promoted the use of academic language and discourse in this content area. As such, the WIDA Consortium has evolved its guidelines to deepen teachers’ conceptual understanding of language in their content areas, and thus, enable them to provide more effective instruction to multilingual learners. Karen L. Terrell explores one of the primary “key language uses” in mathematics — the narrative genre. She also considers how visuals can be powerful scaffolds and means of expression for multilingual learners and discusses how visuals can be used for students to both receive and express knowledge. The use of narrative and visuals can make mathematics more accessible to all students.

        <title>First Person: Sticker politics</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-51, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;On Lucía van Ryzin’s first day as a student teacher, she was given a sheet of stickers and told to give a sticker to each student who was seated, silent, and had a notebook out. As she walked around the room, she noticed that some students were more focused on getting the sticker than on thinking about their assignment. She uses the experience to weigh the value of extrinsic motivators like stickers for motivating student learning.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 56-58, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Competition-based efforts to improve student achievement have not borne fruit. Marion Brady argues that this is because such efforts do not address the problems with the current system of education, in which human knowledge is broken up into separate disciplines. He advocates a systems-based approach that focuses on how ideas and experiences relate to one another.

        <title>Federal focus on education initiatives wins broad public support Findings from the 56th annual PDK Poll</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-30, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Preparing students to enter the workforce and attracting and retaining good teachers are Americans’ top educational priorities for the next administration in Washington, regardless of who wins the upcoming presidential election, the 2024 PDK Poll finds. While eight in 10 or more Americans pick those two items as priorities, other policy priorities also win broad support. Seven in 10 — or more — favor an increased focus on addressing student mental health, helping students who have fallen behind academically, and college affordability. The survey was produced by Langer Research Associates for PDK International, with data collected June 21 to July 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a representative, random national sample of 1,009 adults.

        <title>Creating a space for regulation and reflection</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 44-48, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In response to the growing awareness of trauma and its impact on student learning, schools across the country are implementing trauma-sensitive practices. Authors Maia Cucchiara and Mary Beth Hays describe an approach to trauma sensitivity in schools: the creation of restoration rooms, spaces designed to help students (and adults) return to a state of regulation. Restoration rooms are not for disciplining students. Instead, they are spaces equipped with fidget toys, soft carpets and cushions, flexible seating, and other materials to promote regulation. Schools can use these spaces as part of larger efforts to respond to student and staff trauma and promote overall wellness.

        <title>Talking back to the failing-schools narrative</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 15-18, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;PDK polls consistently show that parents give their children’s schools high marks but are dissatisfied with the performance of public schools nationally. This paradox may be explained by the persistent narrative of failing public schools that has dominated media coverage in the past 50 years. Authors Mark Hlavacik and Jack Schneider tracked the prevalence of the failing-schools narrative in print publications, books, and other media. They found connections between national coverage of education and local education reporting. This national narrative of failing schools uses public schools as a scapegoat, which absolves us of our collective responsibility to each other. A more nuanced and multifaceted narrative of public schools is needed.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-23, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Negative public perception of schools nationally impacts the teaching profession in direct and indirect ways. This perception has depressed the number of students in teacher preparation programs at universities. Indirectly, public perception affects teacher working conditions, compensation, and morale. Education advocates and researchers talk about the historical roots of perception of teachers, how and why negative perceptions persist, and how teachers can change the narrative.

        <title>Lessons from the early literacy tutoring landscape</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/106/1&quot;&gt;Volume 106, Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;, Page 31-36, September 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Since the COVID-19 pandemic, tutoring has gained popularity as a strategy to improve the academic achievement of struggling students. Intensive, relationship-based tutoring is a highly effective academic support for many students. A range of tutoring approaches are available to accelerate young students’ literacy. Sarah Novicoff and Susanna Loeb discuss the research into early literacy tutoring and share the key elements found in effective programs.

        <title>Investigating students’ reasoning in generalization of deconstructive figural patterns</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Different types of reasoning, such as intuitive, inductive, and deductive, are used in the generalization of figural patterns, as an important part of patterns in school mathematics. It is difficult to demarcate the constructive patterns where the regularity observed in the first few sentences is generalizable to the other sentences and each reasoning can lead to the correct answer. To examine the types of reasoning used by students and related factors, this study focuses on the deconstructive figural patterns through the design of three targeted tasks. The participants were 33 female students randomly selected from three 10th grade classes in one school. The data collected showed that a consistent reasoning is not used in tasks by the same participant and various factors, such as the appearance of the figures and the concepts used in the tasks, are involved in employing a reasoning. Moreover, the intuitive reasoning under the influence of a salient irrelevant variable was more prevalent than the others in the incorrect answers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension: cognitive structure and levels of geometrical ability</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present study examines secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension based on Duval’s theoretical framework regarding perceptual, operative, and discursive apprehension. The aim is to explore the cognitive structure of the geometrical figure apprehension dimensions (operative, discursive, and perceptual) in three grades of secondary school students. The tasks in the present study were completed by a sample of 881 students attending public secondary education in Cyprus. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the stability of the structure of the model concerning secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension. However, differences were found in the interrelations among the three main aspects of the model in the examined grades (9, 10, and 11). Moreover, it was observed that students find it easier to solve tasks involving perceptual apprehension compared to discursive apprehension tasks, indicating a possible hierarchical structure of figure apprehension. The present study acts as a pilot study of the constructed instrument. Finally, the results are interpreted in relation to the type of geometrical paradigm in which students work at each hierarchical level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spontaneous focusing on numerical order and numerical skills of 3- to 4-year-old children</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ordinality skills in early numerical development. Here, we investigate individual differences in ordering sets of items and suggest that children might also differ in their tendency to spontaneously recognize and use numerical order in everyday situations. This study investigated the individual differences in 3- to 4-year-old children’s tendency to spontaneously focus on numerical order (SFONO), and their association with early numerical skills. One hundred fifty children were presented with three SFONO tasks designed as play-like activities, where numerical order was one aspect that could be focused on. In addition, the children were administered tasks addressing spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON), numerical ordering, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production. Our results showed that children had substantial individual differences in all measures, including SFONO tendency. Children’s SFONO tendency was associated with their early numerical skills. To further investigate the association between SFONO tendency and numerical ordering skills, a hierarchical regression was conducted for a group of children who could successfully order sets from one to three at a minimum and were regarded as likely having the requisite skills to spontaneously focus on numerical order. The findings reveal that SFONO tendency had a unique contribution to children’s numerical ordering skills, even after controlling for age, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production. The results suggest that SFONO tendency potentially plays a relevant role in children’s numerical development.&lt;/p&gt;
