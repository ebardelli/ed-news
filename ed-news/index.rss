        <title>Interdependency, alternative forms of mathematical agency and joy as challenges to ableist narratives about the learning and teaching of mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Catering for the mathematical needs of disabled learners equitably and productively requires the anti-ableist preparation and professional development of teachers. In CAPTeaM (Challenging Ableist Perspectives on the Teaching of Mathematics), we design tasks that emulate inclusion-related challenges from the mathematics classroom, and we engage teachers with these tasks in workshop settings. In this paper, we focus on evidence from one type of task in which participants engage in small groups with solving a mathematical problem while at least one of them is temporarily and artificially deprived of access to a sensory field or familiar channel of communication. In this paper, we focus on evidence of emerging resignification – discursive and affective shifts in the participating teachers’ sense-making about what makes the construction of mathematical meaning possible and valuably different – as they work on the tasks. By linking Vygotsky’s vision about the educational changes required to empower and include disabled learners with more contemporary ideas from embodied cognition and disability studies, our analyses show how engagement with the tasks affects participants’ realisation and appreciation of interdependencies between learners, teacher, resources, and emotions, highlights alternative forms of mathematical agency and gives opportunities to turn initial sense of impasse and despair into joy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Contributions of the anthropological theory of the didactic to the epistemological programme of research in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the early 1980s, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;theory of didactic situations&lt;/em&gt; put the analysis of mathematical activity at the core of the didactic analysis, thus initiating a new research programme in mathematics education: the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;epistemological programme&lt;/em&gt;. This paper describes and interprets some of the contributions of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;anthropological theory of the didactic&lt;/em&gt; (ATD) to the development of this programme. These contributions come from the new institutional and ecological perspective provided by the ATD to approach the didactic problem and from the significance it assigns to macrodidactic phenomena characterised by didactic transposition. They are illustrated with research works involving different fields of school mathematics in which the ATD team led by Spanish researchers played a central role: research in school algebra and its relations with functional modelling, differential calculus, and real numbers. The paper concludes by briefly describing the contributions of the ATD to the dialogue between didactic theories, another domain that has notable Spanish contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Differential instructional qualities despite equal tasks: Relevance of school contexts for subdomains of cognitive demands</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cognitive demand is a crucial dimension of instructional quality. Its heterogenous operationalizations call for refined investigations, with respect to discursive richness (generic conceptualizations) and conceptual richness (subject-related conceptualizations). Considering not only teachers’ intended cognitive activation (operationalized, e.g., by tasks), but also the enacted activation and individual students’ participation as realized in the interaction, raises the question of how far the interaction quality is associated with students’ prerequisites, school context, and class composition. In this paper, we present a video study of leader-led small-group instruction (in 49 groups of 3–6 middle school students each) with the same fraction tasks, so that differences in interaction quality can be scrutinized in generic and subject-related conceptualizations. In spite of equal task quality, large differences occurred in interaction quality across heterogenous class compositions. The regression analyses revealed that the enacted activation and individual participation were significantly associated with the school context (of higher-tracked and lower-tracked schools), but much less with individual learning prerequisites. These findings reveal the need to capture students’ collective and individual engagement in cognitive demands in the interaction and in generic and subject-related conceptualizations and to systematically investigate their association with class composition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conceptualizing White-Ability Saviorism: A Necessary Reckoning With Ableism in Urban Teacher Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;White saviorism is a well-documented phenomenon in the education literature. Particularly, researchers have made connections between white saviorism and teacher preparation for urban contexts serving Students of Color negatively impacted by legacies of systemic racism. Scholars are increasingly taking an intersectional lens to understand the ways in which racism and ableism intersect, yet much of the literature on white saviorism does not critically examine the role of ableism. In this meta-ethnography, we review extant qualitative research on urban teacher preparation in an effort to extend the analysis to include a robust examination of ableism and deepen our understandings of white supremacy in these spaces. To this end, we conceptualize white-ability saviorism as a more comprehensive and precise way to understand the dynamics at play in urban teacher preparation that contribute to white supremacy and perpetuate educational inequities for urban Communities of Color.

        <title>Earth for all: Five policy turnarounds for a sustainable world</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The second in the new series of reviews for Action Research Journal is inspired by, and aims to contribute to, this journal’s focus on transformations towards sustainability. How can we, as action researchers, connect our emancipatory, grassroots work with the big global transformations needed to bring forth a just, harmonious and thriving world? When so much needs to transform, where do we start? In 2022, the Club of Rome offered a possible response in a new report called Earth for All, also published as a book and supporting website. Framed as ‘a survival guide for humanity’, Earth for All calls for ‘five extraordinary policy turnarounds’: ending poverty; addressing gross inequality; empowering women; making our food system healthy for people and ecosystems; and transitioning to clean energy. It is ‘an aspirational, stubbornly optimistic guide to the future’ (p. 26). It argues that action on these five big issues could give us the momentum we need to transform the economy in support of sustainability. Action researchers can help to give this agenda momentum by bringing it into our conversations with citizens and facilitating spaces for dialogue and agonism.

        <title>Supporting prospective mathematics teachers in noticing students&#39; proportional reasoning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates the effect of a professional development program designed to develop prospective mathematics teachers’ ability to notice students’ proportional reasoning.  It examines how those teachers attended to student thinking, how they interpreted it, and how they decided to respond. Sixteen prospective teachers (PSTs) at a state university participated in a seven-week online professional development (PD) program. We provided participants with a research-based framework for proportional reasoning and engaged them in various ways via interviews with middle school students. They also wrote a reflection paper and received feedback. Combining multiple elements with interviewing was a unique feature of this program. The improvement in participants’ noticing skills was statistically significant. Specifically, in the post-assessment, the participants paid attention to most of the mathematical details of the students’ strategies, provided interpretations supported by conceptual underpinnings and evidence, and made research-based student-oriented decisions that focused on key issues. Implications for future teacher education practices and suggestions for further research are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Coding and Computational Thinking Across the Curriculum: A Review of Educational Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Teaching coding and computational thinking is an emerging educational imperative, now embedded in compulsory curriculum in the United States, Finland, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia. This meta-synthesis of 49 studies critically reviews recent international research (2009–2022) of coding and computational thinking as core and integrated across the curriculum. It addresses four essential problems: (a) What are the key features of learning environments that successfully develop students’ coding and computational thinking? (b) What is the impact of student engagement in coding and computational thinking on learning outcomes across curriculum areas? (c) What pedagogical constraints are evident for coding and computational thinking, including across curriculum areas? and (d) Which conceptual frameworks support coding and computational thinking, and what has been marginalized or excluded? The review advances knowledge of coding and computational thinking—vital to guide and develop future AI-based solutions to real-world problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries.

        <title>Teacher Shortages: A Framework for Understanding and Predicting Vacancies</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We develop a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting teacher shortages at the state, region, district, and school levels. We then empirically examine how teacher shortages vary geographically and by subject using data on unfilled teaching positions in Tennessee traditional public schools during Fall 2019. We find that teacher staffing challenges are highly localized, causing shortages and surpluses to coexist. Aggregate descriptions of staffing challenges mask considerable variation between schools and subjects within districts. Schools with fewer local early-career teachers, smaller district salary increases, worse working conditions, and higher historical attrition rates have higher vacancy rates. Our findings illustrate why viewpoints about, and solutions to, shortages depend critically on whether one takes an aggregate or local perspective.

        <title>The Next Chapter of Critical Educational Policy Research: Research Informing Policy Design</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Drawing on the special issue’s collection of articles, the following commentary examines the racial biases in K-12 and higher education policies and products revealing their seemingly neutral and objective facades to be inherently racialized and, at times, explicitly racist. The article also highlights the damaging effects of race-evasive language in K-12 and higher education, advocating for the prioritization of the most vulnerable students in policy and product design. Rooted in prior research and the author’s experiences as a Latina, a first-generation college student, and a former K -12 educator, the article argues for the abolition of harmful practices like corporal punishment and school resource officers. The author suggests that effective policy design for racial justice may require both mainstream and alternative approaches and highlights successful programs like Freedom Schools and ethnic studies programs. Lastly, the article emphasizes the need for educational policies to reflect a deep understanding of systemic racial inequities and for the research community to directly influence policy design towards equity and inclusion.

        <title>CTE Mechanisms: The Effects of Career and Technical Education Center Admissions Offers in Baltimore</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While there is a growing body of literature related to the benefits of participation in career and technical education (CTE) in high school, there remains a dearth of causal work in this area. Relying on administrative data from Baltimore City Public Schools, which uses a ranking system with a strict cut score to assign students into CTE-focused high schools, we employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of attending one of these high-quality CTE schools on attendance, career pathway completion, high school GPA, and SAT scores. We find that students who are offered admission to a program within one of the CTE centers are significantly more likely to complete a CTE pathway, though they present significantly lower GPAs. Implications are discussed.

        <title>Strategies for solving multiplicative problems using a conceptual model-based problem-solving approach. A case study with a student with autism spectrum disorder</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines the multiplicative problem-solving strategies used by a 14-year-old student with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities during an instructional process based on the Conceptual Model-based Problem Solving (COMPS) approach. The instruction aimed to enhance conceptual comprehension of problem-solving by the use of model diagrams representing mathematical relations involved in word problems. These diagrams aid in selecting the appropriate operation for each type of multiplicative problem, including equal-groups, multiplicative comparison, and combination problems. We further discuss how the instructional process promoted conceptual understanding for the three problem types, highlighting the development of strategies (modeling, counting, and operations) and the pivotal role of the COMPS methodology components in this progression. The results indicate that the student adeptly adopted the COMPS approach, facilitating the transition from informal modeling to written operations, with his choice of strategies varying depending on the type of problem. While there was a higher utilization of modeling strategies in equal-groups and combination problems, modeling was not as frequently employed in comparison problems. We speculate how this differentiated strategy preference could be associated with certain characteristics of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Interrogating the equity promise for Black immigrant students in reformed mathematics classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As increasing numbers of Black immigrant students attend schools in Chile, we examine classroom practices to consider the limits of the mathematics education equity promise for this student population. We focus on the practices of a third-grade teacher who participated in professional development for enhancing reform-based mathematics teaching in a racially diverse classroom. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s approach to race, our analysis shows how two technologies of race-power fabricate the Black immigrant child as an uneducable and impossible mathematics learner. We contend that rather than enhancing the inclusion of Black immigrant students, reform-based mathematics teaching might maintain and reinforce racial hierarchies of mathematics ability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lesson study beyond its initial adaptation: a case without external support</title>

            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Since 2016, Park School in Denmark has consistently used Japanese lesson study as an approach to the professional development of its mathematics teachers. The school has moved beyond the initial adaptation of lesson study, and no longer includes external support. In this article, I investigate how three groups of teachers participated in the maturing lesson-study phases, especially the reflection phase. I apply social practice theory, particularly the concepts of figured worlds and improvisation, to examine the groups’ improvisation of artefacts and actions during lesson study, and the mature, valued outcomes. This study explains how and why the mature lesson-study efforts at Park School offer predominantly superficial learning opportunities to students and teachers alike. It concludes that in countries unaccustomed to lesson study, external support (or other external knowledge sources) is also important at the mature stages of its adaptation. This study proposes three activities that offer such support.
