        <title>Do Teachers With Absent Students Feel Less Job Satisfaction?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Research and policy have focused predominantly on the individual consequences for students who miss school. Yet absenteeism does not occur in a vacuum, and less work has focused on how student absenteeism correlates to classroom dynamics. Practically no attention has been paid toward teachers. We propose in this study that student absences make it challenging for teachers to enjoy the very function of their jobs and thus experience more dissatisfaction at work as a result. We find that teachers have lower job satisfaction when more of their students are absent. However, we find statistically significant differences only for broad aspects of teacher satisfaction—job enjoyment, usefulness, and belief in the profession—rather than differences among other related measures of teaching.

        <title>Learning to leverage teachers’ ideas: facilitators’ growth in moderation practices with simultaneously strong goal focus and participant focus</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When novice facilitators start to lead teachers’ professional development (PD), they have been found to struggle to combine a strong participant focus (i.e., valuing and working with participating teachers’ needs and ideas) and goal focus (working toward the PD goals), whereas expert facilitators seem to be more able to integrate both focus. Empirical studies have identified these challenges across contexts and several situational demands, for example, when facilitators set goals, plan a PD activity, notice teachers’ ideas, and moderate video-based discussions. In this paper, we contribute to this line of research by investigating another situational demand in a longitudinal perspective: We studied how two novice facilitators moderated the discussion after the same PD activity several times. The qualitative comparative analysis of transcribed videos from PD sessions revealed that each facilitator used several practices with varying degrees of goal and participant focus. Over time, they learned to apply more practices that were, simultaneously, strongly goal and participant focused: By leveraging teachers’ ideas toward the PD content goals, they achieved integration of both focus, which have sometimes previously been experienced as conflicting. We discuss implications for facilitator preparation programs in terms of unpacking facilitation practices and explicitly working with the content elements for finer-grained goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mathematics achievement at rural and urban secondary schools: a trends analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The education gap between rural and urban areas hinders social and economic development. Urban students often have better academic performance, leading to more job opportunities and higher social status. This perpetuates social stratification as high-level skills are in demand. Recognizing and addressing these disparities is crucial to tackling social inequalities. Bridging these gaps will promote social and economic progress and empower communities in an ever-changing world. This study aimed to examine the relationship between mathematics achievement and various factors at the student and school levels among eighth-grade students in rural and urban areas of Malaysia. Using data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) collected from 1999 to 2015, separate multilevel analyses were conducted for students in rural and urban schools. The findings indicate that student-level factors play a significant role in mathematics achievement in both urban and rural schools, but school-level factors have a greater association with the achievement of urban schools. Additionally, compositional factors, such as students&#39; socioeconomic background, have a greater relationship with mathematics achievement in urban schools compared to rural schools. The study highlights the need to address the achievement gap in mathematics between urban and rural students in Malaysia, with factors such as attitudes towards mathematics, educational aspiration, and parental education becoming more significant in recent years. Recommendations include investing in early childhood education, attracting high-quality teachers for rural schools, providing resources and technology access, and promoting self-concept in students through collaborative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mitigating Omitted Variable Bias in Exploratory Differential Item Functioning Assessment: A Propensity Score Adjustment Approach</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Omitted variable bias (OVB) in differential item functioning (DIF) assessment can lead to biased estimates of DIF effects, increasing type I error rates and reducing statistical power. Methodologies for addressing OVB, particularly under exploratory conditions where DIF is assessed without prior information, remain underdeveloped. This study addresses these challenges by applying the propensity score (PS) method to enhance the parsimony of the DIF model. Furthermore, this study incorporated the DIF-free-then-DIF (DFTD) strategy into the PS method, establishing the PS.DFTD method for exploratory DIF assessment. The simulation results reveal that the PS.DFTD method appears promising for mitigating OVB in DIF assessment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

        <title>School Board Elections Before, During, and After the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Media reports suggest that parent frustration with COVID school policies and the growing politicization of education have increased community engagement with local public schools. However, there is no evidence to date on whether these factors have translated into greater engagement at the ballot box. This paper uses a novel data set to explore how school board elections changed following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I find that school board elections following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to be contested and that voter turnout in contested elections increased. These changes were large in magnitude and varied with several district characteristics.

        <title>Racial Change in Suburbia: America’s Diversifying Elementary Districts and Their Effect on School Segregation</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The ethnic and racial makeup of the United States has changed during the last several decades. Scholars have qualitatively shown how these changes affect school districts but have not identified their scale. We examine residential demographic change using a novel dataset derived from a geographic technique that leverages satellite imagery with 2000 and 2020 census data. We then analyze the effects of demographic change on student isolation and dissimilarity in elementary school districts. Our findings indicate that most elementary districts have changed, but the changes are uneven. The number of districts with White student intense isolation declined, particularly in suburban locales. Meanwhile, districts with student of color intense isolation increased, particularly in urban locales. These changes indicate that increasing diversity for White students has coincided with greater isolation for students of color. These findings should prompt scholars to reconsider their conceptualization of suburban school districts.

        <title>“So I don’t have to switch up who I am”: Experiences and perspectives of Black Language-speaking mathematics teachers on teaching that supports Black linguistic justice</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Black students are marginalized in mathematics education in the USA, including through their language. However, there is little research on how mathematics teachers can best serve Black Language (BL) speakers. Because BL is a significant sensemaking resource for Black students in mathematics, we investigate how BL-speaking mathematics teachers use their language to support BL-speaking students. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with ten BL-speaking mathematics teachers, we find through thematic analysis that these teachers use BL in three primary ways: (1) as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;access&lt;/em&gt;; (2) as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;; and (3) as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;liberation&lt;/em&gt;. These findings provide important implications for teachers of Black students, including that teachers must familiarize themselves with BL, use language to connect with students, make space for BL in the mathematics classroom, and disrupt the marginalization that happens through language.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Can Education Save Us From Ourselves? Three Psychological Challenges to Democracy</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This review brings social science literature into conversation with education to understand how three psychological challenges—motivated reasoning, misinformation, and conspiracy theories—have been studied in educational research. After describing the challenges, how they function, and how they contribute to democratic backsliding, the authors explore the frequency, orientation, and proposed interventions to these challenges in 59 educational research articles published between 2016 and 2022. We categorize approaches to the challenges as Rational, Affective, or Blended Rational/Affective to describe their framing in educational research. Rational frameworks were the most common, while few studies used Affective frames. The few studies featuring an educational intervention emphasized rational thinking over affective or motivational processes. We suggest ways to bolster understanding of problems created by motivated reasoning, misinformation, and conspiratorial thinking and argue for increased attention to the affective and political nature of these challenges in educational research.

        <title>Modelling mathematics for educational research and practice: a comparison of two theoretical approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The production and use of explicit models of mathematics are important elements of research in Didactics of Mathematics. In this paper, we present and compare two different European approaches to didactical modelling. The first, centred around the notion of basic idea (Grundvorstellung), arose in German-speaking countries as a development within Subject Matter Didactics (Stoffdidaktik). The second is the notion of praxeology from the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, which originated in France. After presenting the genesis and interpretation of these notions as theoretical modelling tools, we provide a detailed case study of actual models produced with these tools, concerning the notion of limits and derivatives. Furthermore, we identify similarities and differences of both models in how they can support didactical research and practice, for instance, by identifying important phenomena or problems. We conclude that the two approaches offer important, different and, to some extent, complementary positions and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
