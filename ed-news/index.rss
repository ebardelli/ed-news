        <title>Reconsidering task classification systems for situations that can be modelled with multiplication</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To effectively teach modeling, instructors need to select tasks that allow students to learn which mathematical operations are appropriate for modeling different scenarios. Naturally, instructors might select tasks using a priori task classification systems—ones that group real-world problems for a given operation based on mathematical formalisms (e.g., as reported by Vergnaud (in: Hiebert (ed) Number concepts and operations in the middle grades, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1988). In this paper, we critique the robustness of a priori task classifications systems for guiding the selection of modeling tasks. We investigated the meanings undergraduate STEM majors attributed to multiplication while modeling a predator–prey system using differential equations. Through analysis of task-based clinical interviews with 23 participants, six distinct justifications for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; multiplication was an appropriate operation for modeling the scenario were identified. These six justifications confirm that learners’ assimilation of scenarios to operations may differ from how educators classify problems using a priori classification schemes. Our findings challenge the use of a priori task classification systems for guiding the pedagogical selection of real-world scenarios to model because classifying real-world scenarios using a priori systems can overlook nuances in modelers’ &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;structuring&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;validating&lt;/em&gt;. We highlight the importance of these nuances for generating task trajectories that would leverage learners existing meanings for mathematical operations to build new associations between mathematical operations and novel problems. We end by suggesting a shift towards reasoning-based classification systems for selecting real-world scenarios to model—ones that are based on students reasoning about and within a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preservice Teachers’ Conceptualizations of Equity and Equality: Tensions Between Technical and Humanizing Approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been introduced and socialized to a cartoon of three children attempting to watch a baseball game as the prevailing definition of equity. Yet, in our sociopolitical context where Black, Brown, and LGBTQ+ children are continuously marginalized, we critique whether this simple construction of equity is sufficient. Rather, we build upon these understandings by outlining tenets of critical humanism and exploring the degree to which PSTs fluctuate between technical and humanist conceptualizations in their definitions of equal and equitable instruction. In this large-scale qualitative study using data collected between 2022 and 2024, we analyzed 1,528 PST responses about their conceptualizations of equity and equality. We found that PSTs harbor various conceptualizations of equity that are robust around resource-based teaching attributes such as materials, instruction, and accommodations. However, PSTs presented paradoxical understandings of equity related to treatment and opportunities, revealing tensions between technical and humanizing approaches to education.

        <title>Effect of International Roommates on College Outcomes: Evidence from Students of Disadvantaged Backgrounds</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;College policies may support intentional cross-cultural interactions among peers. This study examines the impact of having an international roommate on the college outcomes of domestic U.S. students. Using institutional data on more than 6,600 U.S. students from a selective liberal arts college that serves low-income individuals, our analysis demonstrates the positive effects of being paired with an international roommate on U.S. students’ first-year GPA, subsequent GPAs, and second-year retention. However, our findings show no significant effects on graduation rates or retention rates beyond the second year. These findings point to the potential benefits of deliberate organizational and institutional policies to facilitate interactions among individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures.

        <title>The Purposes of Education: A Citizen Perspective Beyond Political Elites</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Education has long been an area of political debate in the United States, with politicians and policymakers advocating for distinct societal and/or individual purposes of K–12 education. In this article, we examine the public opinion on the purpose of education, and we explore whether this political divide on the purpose of education is also represented in the broad public opinion. For a sample 19,032 U.S. respondents, we test whether citizens’ partisanship corresponds with their opinions on seven educational purposes. We observe that the public opinion represents a multifunctional view on education and that some but rather small differences relate to partisanship. We frame these findings in the existing literature and postulate avenues for further research.

        <title>How Much Do New Early Educators Improve Over Time? Tracking Improvement Trajectories Among Early Educators in Louisiana</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/11&quot;&gt;Volume 11, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2025. &lt;br/&gt;We know surprisingly little about returns to experience among new teachers working with very young children, ages 2 to 5 years. This study begins to fill that gap using data on early care and education teachers working in all publicly funded, center-based settings in one state to document the relationship between teacher experience and an observational measure of teacher–child interaction quality. We used both cross-sectional data—similar to the data used in prior small studies—and longitudinal data that allowed us to track the improvement trajectories of individual teachers over a 3-year period. Our findings show considerable improvements over a 3-year period, particularly among new teachers (0.67 SD). Our longitudinal analysis also showed that, although teachers in childcare centers and Head Start began their careers with lower scores than teachers working in school-based pre-K programs, they demonstrated steeper growth trajectories.

        <title>The Madness Behind the Method: What’s Really Beneath Anti-Critical Race Theory Legislation</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Since 2020, legislators across the country have introduced bills aimed at banning instruction of Critical Race Theory in universities. This qualitative study examined 53 bills, most of which contained lists of “divisive concepts” that professors were prohibited from discussing in their classrooms. In addition, I analyzed 26 statements made by supporters of the bills that provided justification for the anti-CRT bans. The data exposed four Discourse Models upheld by these bills and their supporting statements using critical discourse analysis, tools developed by Gee, and legal analysis. The Discourse Models included Neoliberalism, Extreme Nationalism, Colorblindness, and Law as Morality.

        <title>The role of examples in proving and disproving: extending an existing framework</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Examples play a variety of roles in proving and disproving. Buchbinder and Zaslavsky (2019) have produced an a priori mathematical framework for assessing students’ understanding of the role of examples when proving and disproving universal and existential statements. In this paper, I highlight three important aspects that suggest an extension of Buchbinder and Zaslavsky’s framework. These aspects arose a posteriori from research that had a focus on developing mathematically aligned assumptions related to proof and proving. To better approach students’ understanding of the role of examples in proving and disproving, these three aspects need to be explicitly included in the framework: (1) the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;size of the domain&lt;/em&gt; where universal and existential statements are defined, (2) the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;different forms of expression&lt;/em&gt; in which universal and existential statements can be presented, and (3) the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of universal and existential statements. Illustrations of the development of in-service primary school teachers’ assumptions are given to show the emergence of these aspects and to support the extension of the existing framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investigating a learning progression of functional thinking for elementary students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Functional thinking has long been recognized as a crucial entry point into algebraic thinking in elementary school. This mixed-method study investigates the learning progression for elementary students’ functional thinking within the context of routine classroom instruction. Drawing on the existing research, a theoretical framework was constructed to assess the functional thinking of 649 students across grades 3 to 6. The framework includes three modes of functional thinking: recursive patterning, covariational thinking, and correspondence relations, each with particular and general layers of algebraic generality. Psychometric analysis was conducted to validate the assessment instrument. The study identifies a five-level learning progression of functional thinking: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre-Structure&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pre-Functional Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emergent Functional Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Specific Functional Thinking&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Condensed Functional Thinking&lt;/em&gt;. The distinctive characteristics of each level are identified and illustrated. Furthermore, the developmental sequence of different functional thinking modes within this learning progression is analyzed. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are examined.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Telling the story of a diagram: affective and aesthetic mathematical experiences</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we are interested in a dynamic vision of diagrams, focusing on their evocative power, their force in mathematical activity and their potential for interaction with mathematical objects. We are inspired by the work of C. S. Pierce to see diagrams as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;inscriptions that organise space and articulate relations&lt;/em&gt; and that of the philosopher of mathematics G. Châtelet that emphasises diagrams as the very means of ontogenesis. In particular, diagrams are sophisticated mathematical devices for thinking about and communicating mathematics. They have stories and purposes. Focus is on the use of diagrams in the mathematics classroom to tell stories in order to trigger narrative modes of thinking (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a là&lt;/em&gt; Bruner) as part of the mathematical work. Through some examples from the written productions of students at different ages, we examine how the task of telling a story about a given diagram gives rise to multiple views of the diagram. We use this analysis to begin characterising ways in which the mathematical relationships embedded in a diagram acquire a character that is both affective and aesthetic and to suggest implications of such use of diagrams in and for mathematics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Impact of a $10,000 Bonus on Special Education Teacher Shortages in Hawai‘i</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We study the impact of a bonus policy in Hawai‘i Public Schools that raised the salaries of all special education teachers by $10,000. We estimate that this policy reduced the proportion of vacant special education teaching positions relative to general education positions by 32% and the proportion of special education positions that were vacant or filled by an unlicensed teacher by 35%. These impacts were largest in historically hard-to-staff schools in which all teachers received additional bonuses. The policy did not have significant effects on special education teacher retention; instead, the impacts of the policy were driven almost entirely by an increase in the number of general education teachers in the state who moved into open special education teaching positions.

        <title>A Improved , ) Effective df Approximation</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective df as proposed by Satterthwaite, specifically addressing scenarios where component df are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large df, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite’s framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson and Rust, as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants. Finally, the proposed adjustment also provides a correction to the estimate of the total variance in cases missing data have been replaced by multiple imputations such as in the case of plausible values in national and international large scale assessments.

        <title>Does training matter? Effect of training strategies on how pre-service teachers pose and assess modelling problems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Several studies highlight teachers’ challenges when posing and analysing modelling problems, often due to the absence of tools supporting these professional tasks. Thus, an important question refers to the effect of implementing different training strategies on the ability of prospective teachers to pose and assess modelling problems. Our study involves a sample of 110 pre-service primary school teachers, divided into three groups. The first group received extensive theoretical and practical teacher training in mathematical modelling based on the proposal of the study and research paths for teacher education. The second group received intensive theoretical training based on a didactic guide outlining the characteristics of modelling problems. The third group, which acts as a reference group, solely relied on the information provided by the Spanish curriculum. All participants undertake the same experience, involving the redesign and analysis of three textbook word problems into modelling problems. The results shed light on teachers’ training needs and the effectiveness of the tools in enhancing their ability to pose and assess modelling tasks at the primary school level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managing in a Storm of Chaos: The Ecology of School Principals’ Crisis Management</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study provides key empirical evidence of how school principals manage crises, an important but understudied component of their role. Specifically, this paper explores the perspectives of school principals who served as hurricane emergency evacuation shelter managers to understand how they managed the crises that arose during shelter operations and the contextual factors, such as the lack of policies governing shelter management, that facilitated or impeded their ability to succeed in doing so. Our analyses established an ecological framework that blends principals’ managerial knowledge, skills, and training with the larger organizational systems in which crises occurred. Our findings demonstrate the need for improved alignment between the organizations principals serve and what is asked of them as civic leaders during crises.

        <title>Do Public School Choice Policies Segregate Schools? Dynamic Effects in Michigan</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/11&quot;&gt;Volume 11, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2025. &lt;br/&gt;Interdistrict choice has the potential to exacerbate or alleviate between-district segregation—an increasingly pervasive form of U.S. school segregation—by allowing students to attend schools in districts where they do not reside. Prior research concentrates on the effects of charter schooling on segregation within districts and counties. We used longitudinal enrollment and demographic data from Michigan to examine the impacts of both interdistrict and charter school choice on racial and economic segregation within and between districts in a single setting. We estimated these effects by leveraging between-grade differences in choice use within school systems and years. We confirmed findings from previous research that increases in charter school enrollment increase within-district racial and economic segregation. We also found that the effects of interdistrict choice on both within- and between-district segregation vary with the presence of charter schools.

This paper builds on the sentiment categorization proposed by Liang et al. (2020) to distinguish between private and public sector sentiment. The construction of sentiment indices for both sectors aims to allow the exploration of the heterogeneous effects of these sector-specific sentiments on the gold–stock market linkages in China under different market conditions. The empirical results demonstrate a notable asymmetry in the impact of market sentiment between the public and private sectors, with distinct manifestations in stable versus highly volatile market environments. Specifically, positive sentiment in the public sector tends to diminish the safe-haven function of gold, whereas positive sentiment in the private sector tends to reinforce it. This disparity becomes particularly evident during periods of extreme market volatility. Our findings not only underscore the diverse impacts of market sentiment but also provide novel insights into the importance of incorporating sector-specific sentiment when devising hedging strategies for specific industries.

        <title>Using MLP-F in Three Different Aberrant Behaviors in Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Zhu et al. proposed a person-fit method based on the neural network called machine learning person-fit method (MLP-F) and found promising improvements over some traditional methods. MLP-F relies on constructing an appropriate neural network and uses mean square error as a loss function of the neural network. The primary focus of this study is to explore the potential improvement in classifications by replacing mean squared error with cross-entropy. Additionally, the application of MLP-F requires the establishment of a large number of output nodes when dealing with numerous attributes in an exam. However, an excess of nodes in the output layer may diminish classification accuracy and escalate the demand for training data. This article introduces a novel neural network architecture designed to be more versatile and robust. The findings from the research indicate that utilizing a cross-entropy loss function and the new neural network architecture enhances the performance of MLP-F. Simulation studies, considering various aberrant behaviors, demonstrate that MLP-F is effective in identifying aberrant behaviors and particularly excels in shorter tests, showcasing its potential significance in classroom testing.
