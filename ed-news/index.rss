        <title>“I’m a bit out of place here.”—Preservice teachers’ positioning in the figured world of university mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Preservice mathematics teachers are sometimes trained in programs so that they have both their own courses and joint courses with mathematics majors from the beginning of their studies. While this is thought to provide them with both deep mathematical knowledge and teaching-specific content right from the start, many of them report disaffection with and disengagement from mathematics during their very first semester. Current approaches often frame this from an individual’s perspective, investigating cognitive and affective individual differences among students. In contrast, we aim to understand this issue from a sociocultural perspective, examining underlying social processes. In this study, we thus explored preservice teachers’ experiences of the mathematics component of their training, using Holland and colleagues’ theory of figured worlds as a theoretical lens. Three group interviews with 14 preservice higher secondary teachers in a common mixed setting in Germany (one course specific to preservice teachers, one general mathematics course together with major students) were analyzed. Our findings displayed that the preservice teachers experienced two dichotomous figured worlds of mathematics and mathematics teaching. Our further analysis of their positioning between these worlds provided new insights to explain their disaffection, disengagement, and consequent learning behavior. We discuss practical implications, focusing on different teaching systems and interventions in teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Latinx/a/o Senior Leaders in U.S Higher Education: A Systematic Review of the Literature</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Latinx/a/o senior leaders remain underrepresented in the executive ranks, and more research is needed to adequately address equity gaps in higher education leadership. By employing a systematic literature review approach, we examined 57 pieces of scholarship that focused on the experiences of senior Latinx/a/o leaders in postsecondary education. This exploration was aimed at equipping higher education scholars and practitioners with the tools to understand how Latinx/a/o leaders navigate challenges and opportunities in higher education. We identified three major themes: 1) scholarship focusing on individual traits and important identity-based differences; 2) research describing the environmental and structural conditions that shape these leaders’ realities; and 3) literature describing these individuals’ leadership pathways. As an effort to make this body of work more accessible to researchers and decision-makers, we provided implications for research and practice to shape the field of Latinx/a/o leadership in higher education.

        <title>Exploring secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension: cognitive structure and levels of geometrical ability</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present study examines secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension based on Duval’s theoretical framework regarding perceptual, operative, and discursive apprehension. The aim is to explore the cognitive structure of the geometrical figure apprehension dimensions (operative, discursive, and perceptual) in three grades of secondary school students. The tasks in the present study were completed by a sample of 881 students attending public secondary education in Cyprus. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the stability of the structure of the model concerning secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension. However, differences were found in the interrelations among the three main aspects of the model in the examined grades (9, 10, and 11). Moreover, it was observed that students find it easier to solve tasks involving perceptual apprehension compared to discursive apprehension tasks, indicating a possible hierarchical structure of figure apprehension. The present study acts as a pilot study of the constructed instrument. Finally, the results are interpreted in relation to the type of geometrical paradigm in which students work at each hierarchical level.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using Regularized Methods to Validate Q-Matrix in Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;One of the central components of cognitive diagnostic assessment is the Q-matrix, which is an essential loading indicator matrix and is typically constructed by subject matter experts. Nonetheless, to a large extent, the construction of Q-matrix remains a subjective process and might lead to misspecifications. Many researchers have recognized the importance of estimating or validating the Q-matrix, but most of them focus on the conditions of relatively large sample sizes. This article aims to explore Q-matrix validation possibilities under small sample conditions and uses regularized methods to validate the Q-matrix based on the compensatory reparametrized unified model and generalized deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate models. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the viability of the modified least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and modified smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) methods, comparing them with existing methods. Results show that the modified Lasso and the modified SCAD methods outperform the stepwise, Hull, and MLR-B methods in general, especially under the conditions of small sample sizes. While good recovery in all small sample size conditions is not guaranteed, the modified methods demonstrate advantages across various item quality conditions. Also, a real data set is analyzed to illustrate the application of the modified methods.

        <title>Testing the Way Forward: The Impact of Statewide ACT or SAT Testing on Postsecondary Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Twenty-nine states require or allow all 11th graders to take the ACT or SAT in school, for free, eliminating access to testing as a barrier to college entry. I examine whether this affects postsecondary outcomes using state-aggregated panel data and time-varying difference-in-differences methods. I find policy adoption led to 2% increases in selective 4-year enrollments by students from treated states. However, adoption had no effect on enrollments within adopting states’ selective institutions, in part because institutions enrolled fewer students from out-of-state after adoption. I also find null but directionally negative effects on the number of graduates from state institutions. Therefore, impacts are small but positive for students from adopting states, but null or negative for adopting states’ institutions.

        <title>Prospective secondary teachers’ noticing of students’ thinking about the limit concept: pathways of development</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research has shown that there is a need to examine prospective teachers’ development trajectories related to noticing expertise. An important content in the Spanish high school curriculum (16–18 years old) is the limit concept. Given the importance of this concept in the curriculum and the difficulties some prospective teachers have, developing their noticing of students’ mathematical thinking of this concept in teacher education programs is crucial to achieve high school student mathematics achievement. This study examines how prospective secondary school mathematics teachers (PTs) notice students’ mathematical thinking about the limit concept as they participated in a teaching module. PTs had to anticipate and interpret students’ mathematical understanding and make instructional decisions to support students’ conceptual progression using information about high school students’ understanding of the limit concept. We examined PTs changes related to how they anticipated, interpreted and made instructional decisions during the teaching module. We identified a change in how PTs conceived the understanding of the dynamic limit concept: from all-or-nothing dichotomy to progression; and a change in the instructional decisions they made: from decisions focused on changing the type of discontinuity to conceptual decisions. These changes allow us to characterise development noticing pathways. Our findings also help to identify the teaching module characteristics that support the development of PTs noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Experienced teachers talking about their mathematics teaching with linguistically disadvantaged learners</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Learners of mathematics who are linguistically disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, including impoverished socioeconomic status, continue to be educationally disadvantaged and at considerable risk of school failure and early dropout. This is the case in many parts of the world. While much has been researched on linguistically disadvantaged learners in the fields of sociology and general pedagogy, little is known about the classroom teaching of mathematical content in language-responsive ways for all learners in school. Experienced mathematics teachers draw on a wealth of knowledge of content teaching in language-responsive ways developed through their practices working with linguistically disadvantaged learners in their classrooms. In this paper we report on interviews with some of these experienced mathematics teachers from seven educational contexts focusing on teaching probability in language-responsive ways. We focus on what we can learn from these teachers that could inform our practice as mathematics teacher educators and our research. We identify three challenges and three practices that add nuance and depth to theoretical research findings and recommendations on language in mathematics teaching, which can potentially develop these findings in more practical and accurate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Effects of a Learning Trajectory for statistical inference on 9th-grade students’ statistical literacy</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In our data-driven society, it is essential for students to become statistically literate. A core domain within Statistical Literacy is Statistical Inference, the ability to draw inferences from sample data. Acquiring and applying inferences is difficult for students and, therefore, usually not included in the pre-10th-grade curriculum. However, recent studies suggest that developing a good understanding of key statistical concepts at an early age facilitates the understanding of Statistical Inference later on. This study evaluates the effects of a Learning Trajectory for Statistical Inference on Dutch 9th-grade students’ Statistical Literacy. Theories on informal Statistical Inference and repeated sampling guided the Learning Trajectory’s design. For the evaluation, we used a pre-post research design with an intervention group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 267). The results indicated that students made significant progress on Statistical Literacy and on the ability to make inferences in particular, but also on the other domains of Statistical Literacy. To further interpret the learning gains of this group, we compared students’ results with national baseline achievements from a comparison group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 217) who followed the regular 9th-grade curriculum, and with international studies using similar test items. Both comparisons confirmed a significant positive effect on all domains of Statistical Literacy. These findings suggest that current statistics curricula for grades 7–9, usually with a strong descriptive focus, can be enriched with an inferential focus.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching quality in kindergarten: professional development and quality of adaptive learning support enhances mathematical competency</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adaptive learning support provided by kindergarten teachers before and after (macro-adaptive learning support) as well as during mathematical learning activities (micro-adaptive learning support) is a cross-cutting concept of teaching quality. Effective adaptive learning support enhances children’s learning. However, providing it is challenging and teachers need professional development (PD) to improve the quality of their support. This study investigates the mediating role of teaching quality between PD programs for kindergarten teachers and the development of children’s mathematical competency. 122 kindergarten teachers and their 825 pupils participated in the study. The teachers were randomly assigned to three groups. Two groups attended PD sessions designed to foster either macro- or micro-adaptive learning support. The third was the materials-only control group. The data was analyzed using a self-developed rating instrument focusing on generic and domain-specific elements of teaching quality related to macro- and micro-adaptive learning support. The multilevel latent change model analysis revealed that the PD programs had positive and significant effects on the teaching quality of kindergarten teachers. A significant positive relationship was also found between micro-adaptive learning support and changes in children’s mathematical competency. However, an indirect effect of teaching quality could not be detected, and the PD programs did not have a total effect on children’s mathematical competency. The study reinforces the importance of PD that specifically targets macro- and micro-adaptive learning support for kindergarten teachers. The mediation between PD and mathematical competency development requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Novel Numerical Method for Solving Unknown Statistical Quantities in Multivariate Regression Models</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Simulation studies are the basic tools of quantitative methodologists used to obtain empirical solutions to statistical problems that may be impossible to derive through direct mathematical computations. The successful execution of many simulation studies relies on the accurate generation of correlated multivariate data that adhere to a particular model with known parameter values. In this article, we use a kernel inspired by path tracing rules to algebraically solve unknown causal effects in the context of a multivariate general linear model. The algebraic solution is the basis of the mathematical extension, which integrates a model solver. Examples are used to illustrate a range of applications, where information regarding parameter values and predictor correlations can be partially specified. Code for examples is provided.

        <title>Using Extant Data to Improve Estimation of the Standardized Mean Difference</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article presents methods for using extant data to improve the properties of estimators of the standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size. Because samples recruited into education research studies are often more homogeneous than the populations of policy interest, the variation in educational outcomes can be smaller in these samples than is reflective of the true variation in the population. This affects effect size estimation since the sample standard deviation is used in the denominator of the SMD. We propose leveraging extant data on sample variance estimates from multiple studies, made available via clearinghouse databases such as the What Works Clearinghouse, to standardize a mean difference. This allows effect sizes to be benchmarked across a common and broad population, thus enabling better comparability across studies and interventions. We derive the new estimators of the population variance and the corresponding SMD, which pool sample variances from multiple studies using both an analysis of variance and a meta-analytic framework. We demonstrate the properties of these estimators via analytic and simulation results and offer recommendations for when these estimators are appropriate in practice.

        <title>Strive for Measurement, Set New Standards, and Try Not to Be Evil</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;I consider recent attempts to establish standards, principles, and goals for artificial intelligence (AI) through the lens of educational measurement. Distinctions are made between generative AI and AI-adjacent methods and applications of AI in formative versus summative assessment contexts. While expressing optimism about its possibilities, I caution that the examples of truly generative AI in educational testing have the potential to be overexaggerated, that efforts to establish standards for AI should complement the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and focus attention on the issues of fairness and social responsibility, and that scientific advance and transparency in the development and application of AI in educational assessment may be incompatible with the competitive marketplace that is funding this development.

        <title>Improving Researchers’ Capacity to Address Injustice: An Introduction to the Special Issue</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many education policy researchers have turned to critical policy analysis as a means to better understand and examine injustices in education and beyond. However, such work is still uncommon in educational journals. In this introduction, we describe the purposes of this special issue and offer readers a framework for understanding critical approaches to education policy research, its general tenets, and how it differs from other kinds of policy research. We then outline the contributions of the articles in this special issue. We highlight analytic moves that researchers of all kinds can make based on the critical education policy research tenets we discuss. The introduction concludes with suggestions for where we hope the field will go next.

        <title>The key-roles of the expert during classroom discussions aimed at fostering formative assessment processes through the use of digital technologies</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We study the experts’ practices developed with the support of digital technologies (DT), when they take aware in-the-moment decisions during classroom discussions to promote the development of effective formative assessment (FA) processes. In this investigation, we complement a macro-analysis of paradigmatic examples of classroom activities, focused on the functionalities of DT and on the implemented FA strategies, with a micro-analysis, developed with reference to a theoretical construct useful for interpreting and analysing expert teachers’ roles during classroom discussions (the Model of Aware and Effective Attitudes and Behaviours, M&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;AE&lt;/sub&gt;AB). More specifically, we explore how the expert uses DT to empower these roles with the aim of promoting FA processes. This study has two implications: (1) at the theoretical level, the study will introduce a model aimed at characterising the ways in which the expert can promote FA during classroom discussions when they are mediated by the use of DT; (2) at the pragmatic level, the use of this model to analyse paradigmatic examples from teaching experiments will introduce potential guidelines for teacher professional development aimed at promoting teachers’ autonomous use of DT to carry out effective FA practices.&lt;/p&gt;
