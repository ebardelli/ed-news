        <title>The professional identities of prospective mathematics teachers who teach through programming</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As has been the case in many countries around the world, the new Norwegian curriculum from 2020 included programming as part of mathematics education. However, little is known about how prospective teachers perceive this addition in regard to their developing professional identities. When the results from an electronic survey of 394 prospective teachers showed unexpected findings, five of the subjects were asked to participate in a focus group interview in order to explore some of these results. The focus group interview was conducted to understand how prospective teachers considered the past, present and future aspects of their professional identities as teachers of mathematics through programming. The results reveal that, although the prospective teachers had little experience of programming, they were positive regarding its implementation in mathematics lessons because they identified themselves as digital natives; they therefore believed that learning to program would be easy. They aligned themselves with their students, as masters of technology, in contrast to their future colleagues, whom they implicitly described as digital immigrants. The findings of this study have implications for teacher education. Even if the prospective teachers have a positive attitude toward programming and consider themselves digitally competent, a limited understanding of how programming can be integrated into their mathematics teaching will affect the identities that they see for themselves as teachers who teach mathematics through programming.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shifts in student attention on algorithmic and creative practice tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In mathematics classrooms, it is common practice to work through a series of comparable tasks provided in a textbook. A central question in mathematics education is if tasks should be accompanied with solution methods, or if students should construct the solutions themselves. To explore the impact of these two task designs on student behavior during repetitive practice, an eye-tracking study was conducted with 50 upper secondary and university students. Their eye movements were analyzed to study how the two groups shifted their gaze both within and across 10 task sets. The results show that when a solution method was present, the students reread this every time they solved the task, while only giving minute attention to the illustration that carried information supporting mathematical understanding. Students who practiced with tasks without a solution method seemed to construct a solution method by observing the illustration, which later could be retrieved from memory, making this method more efficient in the long run. We discuss the implications for teaching and how tasks without solution methods can increase student focus on important mathematical properties.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Black Educators’ Racial Identity Attitudes and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy: A Psychological Framework and Survey of Within-Race Diversity</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Historically, Black educators have played a critical role in Black youth&#39;s well-being. Consequently, they are often assumed to “naturally” engage culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), obscuring the diverse ways Black individuals identify, think, and behave regarding race and culture. This psychological survey study examines in-service Black educators’ (N = 238) multidimensional racial identity attitudes, background sociodemographics, and education contexts (postsecondary and current/teaching) in relation to their varied enactments of three CRP domains (African American Curriculum, Culturally Relevant Teaching, Sociopolitical Commitment). Results show CRP variation across individuals according to their racial identity attitudes, backgrounds, and contexts. The resulting conceptual framework advances research and discourse on teacher race by challenging homogenizing, detrimental narratives. Findings have important implications for teacher workforce diversification, training, and retention.

        <title>Transportation Inequities and School Choice: How Car, Public Transit, and School Bus Access Affect Families’ Options</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines how the student transportation options available to families affect which schools are accessible to them in a choice-based setting. The study has two parts. First, we compare commute times by foot, public transit, school bus, and car. We show that providing school bus service reduces commute times and improves access for families without cars, but access to a car fundamentally shapes families’ options. Second, we explore the relationship between neighborhood-level measures of vehicle access and families’ school requests and placements. Car access is strongly associated with school requests and placements even after accounting for neighborhood characteristics. We consider car access as a pathway by which wealth disparities produce educational disparities in settings that emphasize school choice.

        <title>Effects of Behaviour Change Communication on Knowledge and Prevention of Malaria Among Women in Ghana</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Behaviour change communication (BCC) remains a central component of the interventions used in the fight against malaria in Ghana. However, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness. This study evaluated the effects of BCC strategies on knowledge (symptoms, causes and prevention) and overall knowledge of malaria among Ghanaian women aged 15–49 years. The propensity score matching (PSM) approach and logistic regression were used to analyse data from the 2016 edition of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). Women who participated in community-level education or heard/saw media messages on malaria, or both, had significantly more knowledge of the disease than women who lacked access to any of these mediums of communication. The effect of these strategies on women’s overall knowledge of malaria is about 2% to 4% and is higher on their knowledge of the symptoms (3% to 6%) and prevention (2% to 4%) than the causes (2%). The combined effects of both mediums of communication are relatively higher than the effect of either of them as a single medium of communication. Further analysis showed that improved knowledge of the disease is associated with higher preventive measures taken by women for themselves and for their children. The results are more significant in rural and poor households than in urban and non-poor households. These findings underscore the need for the Ministry of Health and its partner institutions to adopt an innovative approach which combines the two strategies in intensively educating Ghanaians, and women in particular, on the symptoms and prevention of malaria, giving due cognisance to households’ socioeconomic status and geographical location.

        <title>Teacher-Designed Mathematical Portfolio Assessments: Motivations, Potential Benefits, and Lessons Learned</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In order to identify the potential benefits and challenges of implementing student portfolios as quality mathematics assessment, a pilot study was conducted with teachers in various secondary school settings. The multi-case study consisted of five teacher participants from geographically and demographically differing contexts, four in the USA and one in Canada. They were interviewed and surveyed, exploring their motivations for utilizing a portfolio system of mathematics assessment for the 2020–2021 school year, the design of their portfolio system, and resultant impacts on student dispositions around mathematics. Each participating teacher implemented different structures of portfolio assessment, including the types of items included and how the items were assessed. Results showed that compared to traditional multiple-choice tests, teachers felt portfolios were a better reflection of their students’ “extra-mathematical” skills, such as problem-solving and persistence. Teacher surveys and interviews also demonstrated confidence that the use of portfolios as assessment was superior to more traditional measures in terms of adhering to good pedagogical practices. Through questionnaire data and interviews, teachers reported portfolios were particularly beneficial for students for whom English is not their primary language, as well as students with special needs. The paper lays the groundwork for additional research studies in the area of student mathematics portfolios based on the provided framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring stakeholders’ sensemaking of the STEA“M” education policy in South Korea</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In 2011, South Korea introduced the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education policy in line with the worldwide emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This study aims to examine the perspectives of the stakeholders involved in the implementation of the STEAM education policy. To accomplish this, a qualitative research design was utilized, and inductive analysis was employed to collect and interpret the viewpoints of 13 stakeholders. These stakeholders encompassed policymakers, national institution directors, regional supervisors, administrators, principals, STEAM lead teachers, and mathematics teachers who created the STEAM-based curriculum in South Korea. Our findings reveal conflicting perspectives among the stakeholders regarding STEAM education. Our analysis also suggests that stakeholders’ participation in STEAM education is discontinuous and driven by the policy wave. Several impediments faced by mathematics teachers were also recognized, including obstacles in aligning STEAM-incorporated mathematics instruction with assessments, inadequate financial and curriculum assistance, and complications within the school climate. We discuss potential components that could affect the success of STEAM education and the conditions necessary for its successful implementation: (1) the need for consensus on the level of policy support; (2) the need for sustainable policy support; and (3) the need for policymakers’ consideration to connect the STEAM education policy with real mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Facilitating factors and obstacles in the coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates of probability</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates is challenging in probability teaching and learning. Modeling is one of the ways of teaching and learning that facilitates inquiry between these two perspectives. Given that, we designed a modeling activity to support fifteen secondary students in investigating theoretical probabilities, relative frequencies, and the corresponding relationship and in estimating the true probability. We analyzed how the design of a modeling activity can afford students’ coordination of the two probability perspectives and the difficulties in the process. This analysis shows that adopting an asymmetric random process and having students extend their models of a simple event to a compound event are helpful for students to coordinate probability perspectives. However, potential obstacles to coordination include an authority issue and statistical bias.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Front End of the STEM Teacher Pipeline: Early-Career STEM Teachers’ Field Experiences and Perceptions of Preparation</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;A growing quantitative literature finds evidence that student teaching placements predict later outcomes of teacher candidates and their students, but there is little large-scale quantitative evidence about the mechanisms for these estimated relationships. We used data from a survey of STEM teachers in Washington State to better understand how their perceptions of preparation were related to student teaching placements and current classroom environment. We found evidence that the composition of students in student teaching classrooms was predictive of STEM teachers’ perceptions of their preparation. For example, STEM teachers who student taught in classrooms with more English language learners and economically disadvantaged students reported feeling prepared to teach these specific student populations. Likewise, STEM teachers who student taught in high-poverty classrooms tended to report feeling better prepared to manage their current classroom, particularly if they were currently teaching in a high-poverty classroom.

        <title>The Use of Dynamic Computer Visualizations Integrated with the POE Sequence: Its Effect on Learners’ Understanding, Retention, and Motivation</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The study investigated the effects of the use of dynamic computer visualizations (DCVs) integrated with the POE (Predict-Observe-Explain) sequence on learners’ understanding and retention of solubility and on their motivation to learn chemistry. In the research, nonequivalent groups pretest–posttest control and comparison group design was used. The study was conducted on 56 freshmen enrolled in the science teacher education program at a mid-sized university in northwestern Turkey. One of the two classes was randomly assigned as an experimental group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 31), and the other was assigned as a control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 25). The data were collected using the Solubility Concept Test (SCT), Chemistry Motivation Questionnaire-II (CMQ-II), Molecular Level Visualization Test (MLVT), and Questionnaire of Students’ Perceptions of DCVs (QSP-DCVs). The quantitative data were analyzed using repeated-measures MANOVA, and the qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The results indicated that the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence was more effective on learners’ understanding of solubility than the traditional lecturer-centered narrative-based teaching method. It was found that some prior misconceptions were retained or reinforced even though the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence was used. This study also found that the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence had a considerable significant effect on learners’ retention of what they learned. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the change taking place in motivation towards chemistry between the experimental and control group, experimental group learners’ perceptions of the use of DCVs were quite positive. Based on the study, it is concluded that DCVs integrated with the POE sequence can be used as an effective way to improve learners’ understanding and retention of fundamental chemistry concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Taking Note of Our Biases: How Language Patterns Reveal Bias Underlying the Use of Office Discipline Referrals in Exclusionary Discipline</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The comments teachers write when sending students to the office have the potential to increase our understanding of how bias may contribute to longstanding racial disparities in school discipline. However, large-scale analysis of open text has traditionally had a prohibitive cost. Through natural language processing techniques, we examined over 3.5 million office discipline records from national samples of more than 4,000 schools for whether teachers’ linguistic patterns differed when describing incidents depending on the race/ethnicity and gender of the students. Results of such analyses consistently showed that teachers wrote longer descriptions and included more negative emotion when disciplining Black compared to White students, especially for Black girls. In conjunction with psychology of language theory, the patterns suggest that teachers may perceive and process student behavior differently depending on student identities. Implications of the findings and potential for research on naturally occurring language data in education are discussed.

        <title>The (In)Consistency of Teacher Survey Responses About Teacher Evaluation Implementation: Implications for Principal Professional Development</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Principals can affect several consequential schooling processes and outcomes. However, their effectiveness varies substantially and is distributed across schools inequitably, underscoring the importance of effective principal professional development (PPD), which begins by using needs assessments to inform PPD content. A researcher-practitioner partnership assessed principal needs via monthly teacher surveys about specific teacher evaluation skills. While internal consistencies were high, test-rest reliabilities were low, implying that reports regarding the quality of specific principal practices may fluctuate substantially over short periods, potentially hampering the design of effective PPD.

        <title>Educator Attrition and Mobility During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Using 7 years of administrative data from North Carolina public schools (NCPS), we track changes in teacher and principal attrition and mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess how attrition is related to characteristics of educators and schools. We find that educator attrition and mobility increased sharply between Fall 2020 and Fall 2022. Data from the pandemic period indicate that educators of color and more effective educators have experienced larger increases in attrition than their White and less effective peers. Gaps in teacher attrition have narrowed between schools educating many versus few historically marginalized students.
