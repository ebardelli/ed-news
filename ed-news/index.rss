        <title>Educational Spillover Effects of New English Learners in a New Destination State</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The number of English learners (ELs) enrolled in public schools has grown substantially in the United States over the past two decades. The growth is especially large in states in the South and Midwest that have not been traditional destinations for recent immigrants. In this study, we examine the effects of new ELs on students in receiving schools in Delaware, which is one of the so-called new destination states. We find significant positive spillover effects in the short term of new ELs on the test scores of the other students in the receiving schools. The positive effects are mainly concentrated among current and former ELs.

        <title>On Existence Proofs, Mathematical Norms, and Professional Obligations</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Proof is a central pillar of mathematical practice, and so teaching proof to undergraduate students is an important responsibility for undergraduate mathematics instructors. Our study contributes to research on one facet of this goal by examining instructors’ responses to student-generated existence proofs. Existing literature on the topic suggests that students might include unnecessary statements or utilize an unnecessary proof structure when writing existence proofs, even if a single confirming example would be sufficient. Instructors in our study &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq1&quot;&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x&quot;&gt;\(\:n=86\)&lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;) ranked five students’ existence proofs containing an unnecessary aspect; using the language of norms and professional obligations, we analyzed these rankings and the instructors’ corresponding justifications. We found that mathematics instructors are willing to accept proofs with an unnecessary aspect from students when doing so allowed the instructors to fulfill a professional obligation to an individual student, to mathematics as a discipline, or to their classroom as a space for collaborative and student-centered mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How much C is in TPACK? A systematic review on the assessment of TPACK in mathematics</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teachers need technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for teaching with technology, and its assessment is crucial for research and practice. Previous literature reviews on TPACK assessment were not specific to a content area (e.g., mathematics), although, by definition, the TPACK framework includes content-specific knowledge facets. Consequently, requirements for TPACK assessment could differ depending on the content. Further, reliable assessment of mathematics-specific TPACK depends on the quality of the test instruments used, but there is no consensus on the type of instruments used in past studies. This systematic literature review adds to existing reviews by focusing on TPACK assessment in mathematics, investigating the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;study characteristics&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;instrument characteristics&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;operationalizations&lt;/em&gt; of TPACK. Regarding study characteristics, the findings reveal an increase in the number of studies conducted across various countries worldwide. As for instrument characteristics, researchers frequently used self-developed instruments to assess TPACK, often without providing information on reliability or validity measures. Regarding operationalizations, more than half of the studies used self-report scales to assess mathematics-specific TPACK, followed by observations and material analyses, while knowledge tests were hardly used. Additionally, assessments typically referred to the domain of mathematics as a whole instead of subdomains of mathematics. The results raise questions regarding the validity of the instruments and the comparability across studies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Antiblackness as Global Aspiration? Centering Black Studies in Global Higher Education Research</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although education researchers have increased attention to the study of antib﻿lackness, particularly within schools and national boundaries, how antiblackness impacts transnational phenomena within the higher education (HE) field remains undertheorized. As such, this conceptual article introduces the “antiblackness as global aspiration” heuristic and applies it to one cogent example: Sino-African relations in HE. The heuristic highlights two features of antiblackness shaping the globalization of HE: anti-humanity and extraction. The article argues that Black studies illuminate antiblackness in the moves made by aspiring global white subjects in HE.

        <title>Taking an argumentation approach to statistical investigations: developing student data-ing practices</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research literature has provided considerable insight as to how young students might come to deeper understandings of statistical concepts, processes and representations through investigations. However, ‘data-ing’—the critical thinking aspects of decision-making while engaging in statistical investigations—has shown to be more difficult to grasp. Data-ing aspects of statistical investigations identified in literature as particularly challenging include: generating researchable questions, knowing when or how to apply statistical knowledge, seeing a need for evidence to support conclusions, and knowing how to use data as evidence. Argumentation practices necessitate a focus on the use of evidence to logically support a claim, thereby offering potential to focus students on the sufficiency and quality of evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn. As such, argumentation offers potential to support students to engage in data decision-making practices. In the research described here, an argumentation focus was used to guide a statistical investigation with a class of 9–10-year-old students in a suburban Australian school. Analysis of classroom interactions and children&#39;s work samples suggested that taking an argument-based focus supported students’ developing capacity to overcome the aforementioned challenges and to engage in critical, decision-making practices with authentic, messy data within the context of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Students’ local vs. global views of data distributions: a cross-grade-level analysis using eye-tracking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The ability to interpret and compare data distributions is an important educational goal. Inherent in the statistical concept of distribution is the need to focus not only on individual data points or small groups of data points (so-called local view), but to perceive a distribution as a whole, allowing to recognize global features such as center, spread, and shape (so-called global view). However, the latter is challenging for students to acquire. This study, involving 68 students in grades 4, 6, and 8, had two main objectives. First, we aimed to examine the potential impact of grade level on how students perceive and compare distributions presented in dot plots. Despite variations in specific pre-knowledge, our findings showed no significant grade-related differences in students’ gaze behavior or their ability to process global features when comparing distributions. This finding suggests that there is no significant developmental trend across grade levels regarding students’ capacity to perceive distributions globally, a critical aim in statistics education. Our second objective was to extend the findings of our previous work regarding the identification of specific eye-tracking measures as indicators of students’ local vs. global views. In line with our hypotheses, differences in gaze behavior between students with a local and global view were determined regardless of their grade level. This robustness across different educational stages underscores the validity of specific eye-tracking measures as reliable indicators for students local vs. global view of data. Our research highlights the potential of eye-tracking for understanding students’ data interpretation approaches in statistics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mathematical tasks: a review of classification systems</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Classification of mathematics tasks has long been an important part of classroom assessment. The classification systems used in this context are based on different approaches and often make use of different categories of analysis. Comprehensive studies that examine these aspects in terms of their interrelationships, and thus shed light on the contribution of classification systems to research and practice, are of great benefit. The present study provides a systematic overview of classification systems for mathematics tasks (search period: 1956–2023; worldwide distribution). It includes 17 such classification systems developed between 1963 and 2019. These systems are analyzed with the help of a model developed here. On the one hand, this model focuses on the aspects of the use of the classification systems; on the other hand, it considers the theoretical basis and the components of the classification systems. The results show that early attempts to classify mathematics tasks were largely based on Bloom’s work. These classification systems were used to analyze test items from large-scale studies and were related to mathematical content. Since the 1990s, there has been a shift in emphasis in the use of classification systems, with a greater focus on tasks used in learning processes on the one hand, and on mathematical activities on the other. At the same time, there has been an increasing differentiation of the classification systems, allowing different aspects of mathematics learning to be captured.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building a Stronger Case for Independent Reading at School</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The effectiveness of incorporating independent reading practice in schools has long been a subject of uncertainty. To shed light on this ongoing debate, this meta-analysis seeks to investigate the impact of in-school independent reading on three crucial measures—attitudes toward reading, word recognition, and comprehension—focusing on K–10 students. The analysis encompasses (quasi-)experimental studies conducted between 1970 and 2020, examining a total of 7,493 students across 47 studies. Because most studies contain more than one outcome measure or effect size, we used a meta-analytic model with a three-level structure. The findings reveal a statistically significant overall effect size (Hedges’ g = .08). Specifically, the effect sizes are more pronounced when considering word recognition (i.e., word attack, word identification, decoding, and fluency; Hedges’ g = .21) and students’ reading attitude (Hedges’ g = .18) as outcome measures. However, the effect size for comprehension—the most commonly assessed outcome measure—was approximately zero (Hedges’ g = −.014).

        <title>A Mixture Response Model for Identifying Item Preknowledge</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As one of the three broad types of test cheating, item preknowledge has always been a severe threat to test validity and is widespread in various testing programs, especially within some high-volume certification testing programs. While many response-based methods have been proposed to identify and handle item preknowledge, most require the assumption that the compromised items are known. Moreover, few studies have considered that both examinee and item characteristics might affect this cheating behavior, and even fewer have considered the relationship between ability and such behavior when estimating ability. Therefore, this article proposes a mixture model with less strict assumptions on the compromised items. By modeling cheating behavior with a latent response approach, the model takes into account the effect of both characteristics at the item-by-examinee level and assesses how a person’s ability relates to such behavior. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be effectively recovered, and when data contains item preknowledge, the model generally produces more accurate ability estimates than existing models. Finally, an empirical example based on a licensure test dataset illustrates the applicability of the new model.

        <title>Decision making in managing semiotic conflicts in curriculum materials: a training program with prospective teachers in Costa Rica</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The study reported in this paper contributes to the literature on prospective teachers’ decision making, specifically regarding how they analyze and make informed decisions about the use of their textbooks. We designed a training intervention with 28 future Costa Rican teachers, in which they had to identify and manage semiotic conflicts that can be found in a textbook lesson. For this purpose, we selected a lesson on proportionality from a textbook commonly used in Costa Rica. We performed an interpretive and exploratory content analysis of teachers’ responses to the textbook lesson assessment tasks. The results show that participants progressed in identifying semiotic conflicts and could produce effective solutions for some of the detected semiotic conflicts. The prospective teachers reflected on the way they used the lesson by proposing improvements in more than one facet (epistemic, cognitive, affective, interactional, mediational, and ecological). We conclude that the training provided allowed the participants to progress in decision making regarding the use of the textbook lesson, although it is necessary to reinforce their didactic-mathematical knowledge on proportionality so that they can develop more critical and well-founded analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
