        <title>Sample Size Calculation and Optimal Design for Multivariate Regression-Based Norming</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Normative studies are needed to obtain norms for comparing individuals with the reference population on relevant clinical or educational measures. Norms can be obtained in an efficient way by regressing the test score on relevant predictors, such as age and sex. When several measures are normed with the same sample, a multivariate regression-based approach must be adopted for at least two reasons: (1) to take into account the correlations between the measures of the same subject, in order to test certain scientific hypotheses and to reduce misclassification of subjects in clinical practice, and (2) to reduce the number of significance tests involved in selecting predictors for the purpose of norming, thus preventing the inflation of the type I error rate. A new multivariate regression-based approach is proposed that combines all measures for an individual through the Mahalanobis distance, thus providing an indicator of the individual’s overall performance. Furthermore, optimal designs for the normative study are derived under five multivariate polynomial regression models, assuming multivariate normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals, and efficient robust designs are presented in case of uncertainty about the correct model for the analysis of the normative sample. Sample size calculation formulas are provided for the new Mahalanobis distance-based approach. The results are illustrated with data from the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS).

        <title>Understanding the cognitive processes of mathematical problem posing: evidence from eye movements</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract  &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study concerns the cognitive process of mathematical problem posing, conceptualized in three stages: understanding the task, constructing the problem, and expressing the problem. We used the eye tracker and think-aloud methods to deeply explore students’ behavior in these three stages of problem posing, especially focusing on investigating the influence of task situation format and mathematical maturity on students’ thinking. The study was conducted using a 2 × 2 mixed design: task situation format (with or without specific numerical information) × subject category (master’s students or sixth graders). Regarding the task situation format, students’ performance on tasks with numbers was found to be significantly better than that on tasks without numbers, which was reflected in the metrics of how well they understood the task and the complexity and clarity of the posed problems. In particular, students spent more fixation duration on understanding and processing the information in tasks without numbers; they had a longer fixation duration on parts involving presenting uncertain numerical information; in addition, the task situation format with or without numbers had an effect on students’ selection and processing of information related to the numbers, elements, and relationships rather than information regarding the context presented in the task. Regarding the subject category, we found that mathematical maturity did not predict the quantity of problems posed on either type of task. There was no significant main group difference found in the eye-movement metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding Joint Exploration: the Epistemic Positioning Underlying Collaborative Activity in a Secondary Mathematics Classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines how collaborative activity among students and the teacher to investigate disciplinary questions, which we term ‘joint exploration’, is established and maintained in a secondary mathematics classroom. Although collaborative and active learning is increasingly sought after in mathematics classrooms, studies of instances of joint exploration remain relatively rare. In this study, we use the theoretical perspective of positioning to conceptualize joint exploration as involving the negotiation among participants to position students with epistemic authority and agency. Using a constant comparative method, we use classroom video data of two episodes containing joint exploration and closely analyse the shifts in epistemic positioning within them. We find that shifts in epistemic positioning, especially with respect to students positioning one another with epistemic authority and exercising epistemic agency, help to support continued joint exploration. We also find that the teacher can play an important role in decentring themselves as the epistemic authority. In addition to these findings, this study contributes a distinction in epistemic authority and agency, as we explain how the two concepts are related and involved in establishing and maintaining joint exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Meta-Analyses and Narrative Review of Home-Based Interventions to Improve Literacy and Mathematics Outcomes for Children Between the Ages of 3 and 5 Years Old</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of these meta-analyses was to examine the effectiveness of home-based interventions aimed at improving literacy and mathematics outcomes for preschool-age children (mean age = 4.29 years; range = 3.07–5.32 years) and to develop an understanding of what home-based interventions work in different contexts. A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria for these meta-analyses; 30 studies included sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analyses, and two studies did not contain sufficient quantitative data and instead were summarized in a narrative review. The average weighted effect size for interventions with literacy (d = 0.10; CI = [−0.17, 0.38]; n = 27) and mathematical outcomes (d = 0.18; CI = [−1.62, 1.99]; n = 8) were minimal. Hence, these meta-analyses showed that home-based interventions had minimal effect on literacy and mathematical outcomes for preschoolers. There were more home-based interventions with literacy (N = 28) than mathematical outcomes (N = 10). The heterogeneity showed no variability, indicating that all intervention impacted on children’s outcomes to similar effect. Overall, many interventions were relatively light touch (i.e., time spent engaging in parent training), and the engagement requirement of the parent in some studies was minimal (e.g., reading a short text message). More in-depth research into the components of interventions (e.g., focus, training approaches) and evaluation of interventions before they are implemented is essential for ensuring that early interventions will be effective and lead to the development of the intended skills.

        <title>The role of digital technologies in mathematics education: purposes and perspectives</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Over the last decades, digital technologies (DTs) have become ubiquitous in mathematics education. Still, their integration into classroom teaching and learning varies enormously. In this narrative overview, we focus on the different purposes for which DTs are used in mathematics education in order to study how the effectiveness of DTs depends on researchers’ underlying goals and perspectives. We set up an experience- and literature-based framework including five different purposes. Applying this framework gave rise to the following results: (1) there is evidence for the benefit of using DTs for mathematics learning; (2) research on DTs leads to new theoretical developments and (3) to new design paradigms; (4) issues of equity with respect to access to and use of DTs are important but under-researched; and (5) DTs challenge curricula and teaching and assessment practices. While early research on the use of DTs focused on questions such as “does it work?” or “does it work better?”, the maturing of the field has shifted to more nuanced questions. As a future research agenda, we recommend further study of how the use of DTs in mathematics education impacts the time required for learning as well as the temporality of teaching and learning, how it changes the nature of doing mathematics and the relation to basic skills and higher-order skills in particular, how curricula, teaching practices, and assessment might change due to the availability of sophisticated mathematical tools, how DTs and other resources might be combined in teaching and learning, and how they may help to address equity issues in education. These questions will prompt the development of new theoretical constructs and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Performance Evaluation of Urban Emergency Governance: Conceptual Connotations and Empirical Research Based on the Crisis Life Cycle Theory</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although scholars have discussed in depth about the evaluation content and the construction of evaluation index system of emergency management and crisis management, a unified and standardized interpretation of system construction concepts and empirical research on the performance evaluation of urban emergency management is still lacking. In view of this, this paper is based on the theory of the  crisis life cycle, with the four phases of urban emergency management and the content of the task as a clue, constructed a performance evaluation index system containing 12 primary indicators and 44 secondary indicators, and centered on the emergency management work situation of S city. The study reveals that emergency management underperforms in S city, with a score of 5.948, qualifying as the “defined level”. The “prevention and preparedness stage” receives poor evaluation, indicating a significant bias for crisis response instead of prevention. The report suggests the improvement of emergency material stockpile planning, the formation of grassroots emergency response teams, the emergency management publicity, and special emergency drill plans, etc., with a view to providing reference for city managers to comprehensively review and evaluate the emergency management system, and to promote the construction of a more systematic, complete and scientific urban emergency management system.

        <title>Recent developments in using digital technology in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper we review selected significant developments in the use of digital technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics over the last five years. We focus on a number of important topics in this field, including the evolvement of STEAM and critical making as well as the process of redefining learning spaces in the transformation of the mathematics classroom. We also address the increasing use of computer algebra systems and dynamic geometry packages; and the issue of student collaboration online, especially using learning environments and social media. We briefly touch on artificial intelligence systems, including hyper-personalisation of learning, multimodality and videos. We include a brief discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on mathematics education, and lastly on the more theoretical perspective of the epistemology of digital technology and the construct of humans-with-media. We conclude the discussion with some possible concerns and mentioning some possible new topics for research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Need for Educational Research Engagement With Courts, Public Policy, and Practice in a Post-Dobbs Era</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), the U.S. Supreme Court overturned decades of precedent regarding the federal right to an abortion for people who can carry pregnancies. This case has substantial significance for the education field, directly affecting school- and college-age marginalized students who can carry pregnancies. In this essay, I argue that Dobbs and subsequent policies have created a significant need for educational research to inform courts, public policy, and practice to improve social and educational structural support for marginalized students who can carry pregnancies in a post-Dobbs era. This need is because Dobbs and subsequent policies have significantly diminished reproductive justice, and reproductive justice is intricately tied to marginalized students’ ability to fully engage in their education. Timely educational research is critical to address the systemic inequities that Dobbs and related policies have exacerbated and reified.

        <title>Continuous Improvement, Institutional Review Boards, and Resistance to Practitioner Scholarship</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this essay, we explore the tension between research using continuous improvement (CI) paradigms, such as improvement science, and conventional research, and the role and regulation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight. We argue that the current regulatory structure privileges traditional research and hinders collaborative inquiry that centers the voice and agency of those traditionally marginalized. We also question whether IRBs should limit CI efforts required of educational leaders as part of their jobs. We offer recommendations for how IRBs and scholar-practitioners can together support CI efforts.
