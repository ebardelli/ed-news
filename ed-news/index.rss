        <title>Does problem posing affect self-efficacy, task value, and performance in mathematical modelling?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Problem posing is a promising teaching method for enhancing motivation and performance in mathematics and more specifically in mathematical modelling. Hence, the goals of our study were twofold: (1) to examine the effects of problem posing on modelling performance, self-efficacy, and task values in solving modelling problems, and (2) to analyze whether problem posing affects modelling performance via self-efficacy and task values. In a randomized control trial involving ninth- and tenth-grade students (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 210), participants were assigned to either a problem-posing and problem-solving group or to one of two problem-solving groups. Students in the problem-posing and problem-solving group received a booklet with descriptions of real-world situations and were prompted to pose and subsequently solve their own problems. Students in the two problem-solving groups received the same real-world situations with given problems and were asked to solve the problems. Before solving the problems, students in all groups reported their self-efficacy and task values. Prompting students to pose their own problems positively enhanced students’ self-efficacy and partially improved their task values in solving modelling problems. Further, problem posing indirectly affected modelling performance via self-efficacy but not task values. However, problem posing had no total effect on modelling performance. The findings for self-efficacy and task values are in line with expectancy-value theories, adding new insights to the field by highlighting the importance of motivational constructs in problem-posing approaches and instructions aimed at fostering mathematical modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Students Under Surveillance: Big Data Policing and Privacy Rights</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The surveillance and securitization of schools has transformed over the last decade to include predictive analytics and algorithms. In Florida, for example, the Pasco Sheriff’s Office used school record data sets to identify and monitor youth they believed were “destined for a life of crime.” Yet the extent of big data policing as a model of surveillance and control in American public schools has not been addressed in meaningful ways by schools and the courts. This essay argues the burden and risk on student Fourth Amendment and privacy rights place an obligation on the government to actively protect student data and make big data policing efforts transparent. Future research is critical to address the systemic inequities that policing and surveillance have exacerbated on America’s youth.

        <title>Exploring Deficit Beliefs Among High School Math Teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This brief uses national data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 to investigate deficit beliefs, or beliefs that students’ academic underperformance is primarily attributable to deficiencies in their home environments, among high school math teachers. Descriptive results reveal that students in low-level math courses have teachers with more deficit beliefs. Regression results show that net of extensive control variables for both student and teacher characteristics, having a math teacher with stronger deficit beliefs is significantly and negatively associated with students’ math performance. However, this negative association is not more pronounced for youth from minoritized and low socioeconomic status backgrounds.

        <title>Prefiguring Research-Practice Partnerships to Pursue Racial Justice in Education</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/11&quot;&gt;Volume 11, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2025. &lt;br/&gt;Processes of integrating explicit anti-racist goals in research-practice partnerships is under-examined in scholarship, yet intentional anti-racist research-practice partnership (RPP) design and implementation can leverage liberatory and collaborative action research approaches that address the root of racial inequities and advance corrective measures to justly service youth and their families. In this paper, authors analyze qualitative data from the first year of their RPP to describe how they approached their design and launching process as a form of prefiguring for racial justice. They pinpoint how their efforts yielded opportunities, challenges, tensions, and benefits. Their process aligned with Akom’s (2011) Black Emancipatory Action Research (BEAR) framework, which is conceptualized with Afrocentric lenses, honors Black communities, and constructs research as a tool for Black liberation and self-determination. Authors detail findings related to inviting authentic community engagement with justice-driven partners, nurturing youth-centered critical care, disrupting Whiteness norms, and revisiting and negotiating RPP expectations.

        <title>Mathematics education for sustainable futures: a strengths-based survey of the field to invite further research action</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—&amp;quot;Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures&amp;quot;—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at &lt;a href=&quot;link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha&quot; class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring Grading Standards at High Schools: A Methodological Contribution, an Example, and Some Policy Implications</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;At schools with low grading standards, students receive higher school-awarded grades across multiple courses than students with the same skills receive at schools with high grading standards. I show school grading standards vary substantially, enough to affect post-secondary opportunities, across high schools in Alberta, Canada. Schools with low grading standards are more likely to be private, rural, offer courses for students returning to high school after dropping out, have smaller course cohorts, have a smaller percentage of lone-parent households, and have a larger percentage of well-educated parents. The article makes a useful methodological contribution in clarifying the assumptions needed to estimate and interpret a measure of grading standards from course-year-school observations of average school-awarded grades and average external examination grades.

        <title>How curriculum materials can contribute to implementing instructional innovations: the case of enactment of strategy instruction</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although curriculum materials are essential for implementing instructional innovations, little is known about how exactly they support teachers’ enactment of innovative approaches and how explicitly they must integrate their key components. The paper contributes to reducing this research gap for one instructional innovation: explicit strategy instruction for word problem comprehension strategies. In our qualitative video study, teachers participated in a professional development on explicit strategy instruction and experimented with it in their classrooms. We compared the teachers’ enactment of strategy instruction in two implementation conditions: in the strong material support condition, teachers received curriculum materials in which components of strategy instruction were explicitly integrated. In the weak material support condition, the curriculum materials only provided the sequence of word problems, but the teachers had to implement explicit strategy instruction themselves. In the qualitative analysis of four cases of teachers’ videorecorded enactment, we unpacked how one teacher with weak support provided only limited learning opportunities by non-targeted enactment, with limited measurable student strategic learning gains. However, in the same condition, another teacher provided productive learning opportunities by explicit and targeted strategy instruction in spite of weak material support. In the strong material support condition, learning opportunities were assured even in a case of partially non-targeted enactment (yet high measurable student strategic learning gains). The findings bear consequences for combining curriculum materials with strong support and professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Examining Task-Specific Incongruous Mathematics Self-Efficacy in University Intermediate Algebra Students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics self-efficacy (MSE), that is students’ beliefs about their ability to be successful in mathematics, is important because it can predict future academic and career achievement, effort, and success on difficult tasks. However, sometimes there students’ self-efficacy may not match their performance, which we call incongruous mathematics self-efficacy (IMSE). Little previous work has examined IMSE and none has examined it at the level of specific mathematics tasks in university intermediate algebra. In this study, fifteen participants were interviewed and asked about their task-specific MSE for three problems, two purely algebraic and one word problem, that they were then asked to solve. We compared participants’ MSE and their solutions to identify instances of incongruous task-specific MSE, finding them for eleven of the fifteen participants. For example, on the word problem, one participant rated the problem as difficult and expressed low confidence in her work but solved the problem correctly. We describe 12 total instances of task-specific IMSE in qualitative detail. Our results have implications for the measurement of MSE as well as for university educators who strive to better support students’ education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding student errors in comparing data sets with boxplots</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the boxplot, the box always represents – regardless of its area – the middle half of the data and thus a measure of variability (interquartile range). However, when students first learn about boxplots, they are usual already familiar with other forms of statistical representations (e.g., bar or circle graphs) in which a larger area represents a higher frequency of observations. If students erroneously apply this well-established area-represents-frequency schema to boxplots, it results in a systematic error which we describe as the consequence of an incomplete conceptual change. We empirically validated difficulty-generating characteristics that allow the differentiation between item types with varying complexity (item level) and aimed to identify profiles (person level) that differ depending on which schema was used in which item type. For this purpose, we conducted two cross-sectional studies with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 100 university students (study 1) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 297 participants who finished secondary school or higher (study 2) and used generalized linear mixed models (item level) and k-means clustering with predefined cluster centers (person level) to test our hypotheses. We could replicate the systematic error that was described in previous research and found new difficulty-generating characteristics in boxplot items. Our results support the notion of different profiles potentially emerging based on varying degrees of conceptual change. From an instructional perspective, information about individual progress in conceptual change could be considered for tailoring individualized interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Today, various non-governmental organizations proclaim the need for public engagement of citizens, a concept that is integrated into the notion of global citizenship. However, much of the mathematics that students find in the primary school curriculum falls short to support that need. This lack of curriculum alignment with global needs has implications for the development of communities, but they are much more severe for students from underserved populations who systematically suffer different types of exclusions that increase their social disadvantages. This study explores the traits of global citizenship that students from underserved populations exhibit as they progress through a learning experience with open civic data on a global issue (climate change). The learning experience was used as the basis for an individual interview with five participants (9–10 years old) from public schools in low-income neighborhoods of a metropolitan area in northern Colombia. Participants were offered a dataset (data) ready to use and they were asked to undertake data handling actions (data-ing) using freely available web-based software. Participants were asked “What does this dataset say?” and their verbal statements were analyzed. The main findings suggest that in data and data-ing on open civic data reflecting global issues, participants exhibited understanding, belonging and action which are traits of global citizenship. In terms of understanding, participants described the behavior of the variables, suggested informal inferences, and made associations between variables. In terms of belonging and action, participants’ statements suggested including themselves as part of the community, taking responsibility, and proposing transformative actions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Exploring the Potential of Research–Practice Partnerships to Support State Education Leaders as Agents of Change</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/11&quot;&gt;Volume 11, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2025. &lt;br/&gt;State education agencies have increasing influence over educational policy and practice, with responsibilities ranging from vision setting to monitoring compliance with accountability policy. Although state education agency leaders are well positioned to advance change, capacity building at this level of the education system has been traditionally limited. Research–practice partnerships (RPPs) represent a promising venue to support the ability of state leaders to facilitate educational change. In this qualitative study, we drew on semistructured interviews with state education agency leaders and observations of RPP meetings to examine the state-level structures that pose challenges to leaders’ efforts to make change and how participating in an RPP can support leaders in addressing these challenges. Findings reveal how RPP engagement supported state leaders with navigating complex organizational silos and bureaucratic processes by promoting relationship building and supporting the use of evidence-based resources. These insights may inform future research and capacity-building efforts at the state level of the education system.
