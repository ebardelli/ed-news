        <title>Reconnecting with the mathematical thought of the Mesoamerican numbers in Ixil: an onto-epistemological dialogue</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Numbers and languages are present around the world. While mathematics is deemed as universal, communities around the world have developed mathematical practices that align with their specific context and needs. Rooted in an Indigenous epistemological framework, this manuscript presents a dialogue among four co-researchers and teachers retelling their experiences teaching and learning Mesoamerican numbers in both monolingual (Spanish) and bilingual (Ixil and Spanish) contexts. With a strong desire to learn about and reconnect with the forces of Indigenous mathematical thought and language that move within the teaching and learning of these numbers, the authors collectively reflected on their “tellings” of prior work. It is worthy of note that these reflections on teaching and learning processes of naming Mesoamerican numbers, their symbols, and numerical values help realize that these concepts are more fully animated when presented in contexts that are onto-epistemologically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pairwise Regression Weight Contrasts: Models for Allocating Psychological Resources</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Researchers examine contrasts between analysis of variance (ANOVA) effects but seldom contrasts between regression coefficients even though such coefficients are an ANOVA generalization. Regression weight contrasts can be analyzed by reparameterizing the linear model. Two pairwise contrast models are developed for the study of qualitative differences among predictors. One leads to tests of null hypotheses that the regression weight for a reference predictor equals each of the other weights. The second involves ordered predictors and null hypotheses that the weight for a predictor equals that for the variables just above or below in the ordering. As illustration, qualitative differences in high school math course content are related to math achievement. The models facilitate the study of qualitative differences among predictors and the allocation of resources. They also readily generalize to moderated, hierarchical, and generalized linear forms.

        <title>Shame, entitlement, and the systemic racism of mathematics “ability” grouping in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Decades of research has documented the consequences of allocating school students into a hierarchy of classes with narrow ranges of mathematics attainment, a process known as streaming, tracking, setting, or “ability” grouping. The purported benefits of streaming are inconsistent and disputed, but the harms are clear, in particular, (1) the limiting curriculum often available in low streams and (2) the loss of self-confidence that results from being positioned in a low stream. Building on this foundation, we discuss streaming in mathematics as tied to systemic racism in Aotearoa New Zealand, where the harmful effects of streaming fall most heavily on Māori and Pasifika students. Previous analyses of race and streaming have focused primarily on the racial composition of streamed classes, bias in stream allocation, and racialised teacher expectations in streamed settings. In contrast, we focus on the emotional consequences of streaming, arguing that streaming produces racialised emotions of shame and entitlement as unintended but predictable consequences. We illustrate the racialised production of entitlement and shame through collaborative storying, interweaving our own biographies with a re-analysis of student interviews from two prior studies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mental processes underlying a mathematics teacher’s learning from student thinking</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Teachers’ knowledge of students’ mathematical thinking is a growing area of research in mathematics education. The literature has reported plentiful evidence of the interplays between teachers’ mathematical knowledge and their knowledge of students’ mathematical thinking. The present study builds on this body of work to explain how such interplays occur. Over a semester, I worked in partnership with a secondary school mathematics teacher on cycles of task design, interactions with a student, and in-depth reflection on the student’s thinking about linear programming. Adopting and extending Piagetian constructs of assimilation and accommodation, I describe several key mental processes that illuminate the teacher’s learning of mathematics and of the student’s mathematical thinking. I conclude with a discussion of the study’s empirical and theoretical contributions to understanding teachers’ mathematical learning in relation to student thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Relationships between elementary mathematics specialist certification, knowledge, beliefs, and classroom learning environments</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report on the differences in mathematics learning environments in classes taught by certified Elementary Math Specialists (EMSs) (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 28) and their peers (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 33) as determined by observations of instruction. We used path analysis to examine how variables such as mathematical knowledge for teaching, beliefs, and background characteristics were related to the learning environment. We used the Classroom Learning Environment Measure (CLEM) observation protocol, which attends to aspects of mathematics lessons such as opportunities for students to justify their reasoning and attend to mathematical concepts. Our analysis revealed that learning environments incorporating such elements were significantly more prevalent in classes taught by EMSs, and that there were two paths indicating mediation effects on the relationship between EMS status and learning environment. One path was related to teachers’ beliefs about the primacy of computation in learning mathematics; the other path was related to teachers’ mathematical knowledge for teaching and their beliefs about the extent to which mathematical knowledge is constructed by the learner. We share implications for EMS programs and recommendations for future research on the impact of EMSs in elementary schools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Admissions Officers’ Perceptions When Undocumented Students Seek In-State Resident Tuition Policy</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Administrative burdens scholarship has explored the factors influencing bureaucrats’ perceptions and administrative discretion when entitled individuals seek policy benefits. Few studies, however, have recently investigated such phenomena with undocumented youth immigrants. Drawing from online web surveys and conducting a mixed methods study, I examine factors influencing admissions officers’ perceptions of requirements when undocumented youth claim in-state resident tuition benefits in U.S. colleges. The findings suggest that officers who interact more often with undocumented applicants and with more positive social constructions of them are less likely to support stringently applied administrative requirements when they seek in-state tuition benefits. However, such variables are insufficient to frame admissions officers’ decisions. State laws and organizational rules also constrain their administrative discretion regardless of their proclivity to facilitate access to in-state tuition benefits by undocumented youth. This study addresses the tension among public servants’ attitudes and bureaucratic factors mediating efficiency, equity, and integrity surrounding policy implementation. Findings contribute to higher education policy scholarship by exploring the roles of street-level bureaucrats as mediators among state policies, institutional rules, and the circumstances of undocumented applicants.

        <title>Helping or Hurting: The Effects of Retention in the Third Grade on Student Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We evaluate the effects of grade retention on students’ academic, attendance, and disciplinary outcomes in Indiana. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that third-grade retention increases achievement in English Language Arts (ELA) and math immediately and substantially, and the effects persist into middle school. We find no evidence of grade retention effects on student attendance or disciplinary incidents, again into middle school. Our findings combine to show that Indiana’s third-grade retention policy improves achievement for retained students without adverse impacts along (measured) nonacademic dimensions.

        <title>Family-Centered Research: Reflections From a Zoom-Based Recording Method of Families Learning Together at Home</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although schools are a primary focus of education research, we have long known that families are equally critical in supporting children’s learning. However, many existing studies put families in situations that share little resemblance to what family learning looks like outside of school. These limitations undermine both the quality of the research and our commitments to equity. Based on our experiences during the global health pandemic, we reflect on these limitations and offer thoughts to motivate a new vision of family learning research. Among other things, the process revealed the power of allowing families to choose how and when they engage in learning experiences together and finding ways to capture more authentic family configurations beyond the parent-child dyad.

        <title>Facing and challenging language ideologies towards a more inclusive understanding of language in mathematics education research—the case of sign languages</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research on language in mathematics education is largely dominated by a ‘normalcy’ of spoken languages. This modal hegemony does not only affect a whole group of learners in failing to provide access that is epistemologically equitable—those using sign language as their preferred mode for mathematical discourse—it also obscures our view on the roles language can play in mathematical thinking and learning. As a field, we can only win from seeking to understand Deaf learners of mathematics beyond a disability, as learners of mathematics with a specific linguistic background that influences mathematical thinking and learning in peculiar ways. In this contribution, I suggest a shift in mindset towards a more inclusive view on language in mathematics education research and practice. I propose basic principles to inform a perspective for reconsidering the role of language in mathematics thinking and learning, inspired by work of philosopher Francois Jullien. This perspective counters a perspective that merely integrates sign language into existing research and instead searches for dialogue between linguistic modalities in learning mathematics, looking beyond language as spoken or written. This approach will be illustrated by the case of the modal affordance of iconicity foregrounded in signed mathematical discourse, its role in Deaf students’ mathematics thinking and learning, and how this can inform existing research and practice dealing with language in mathematics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning to elicit student thinking: the role of planning to support academically rigorous questioning sequences during instruction</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The use of questioning to elicit student thinking is one of the cornerstones of ambitious teaching; thus, supporting prospective teachers in this complex practice is a core objective of mathematics teacher education. In this paper, we examine the academic rigor of the sustained questioning sequences prospective teachers use during instruction to elicit student thinking and the possible factor lesson planning plays in enacted sequences involving academically rigorous questions. We analyzed the questions they asked during lessons in an early field experience and traced how prospective teachers prepared for those questions as represented in their lesson plans. From our analysis, we found prospective teachers used three types of sustained questioning sequences when eliciting student thinking in the enactment of the lesson. Further, we found evidence suggesting a connection between the questions asked during enactment of a lesson and the quality of questions prospective teachers incorporated into their lesson plan. These findings inform how mathematics teacher educators can support prospective teachers during lesson planning to prepare to elicit student thinking in productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Race at the Top</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Race at the Top addresses topical subjects about parental anxiety, racial discrimination, and migrant assimilation in an upper-middle-class suburb where White and Asian-origin families monopolize a high achieving public high school, Woodcrest. Behind the town’s progressive façade and without overt racialization, White parents mobilize to advantage their children through school policies that curtail the academics stressed by Asian-origin parents. By seeing this clash through the frame of American assimilation theories, this otherwise novel and well-written book does not address it as biopolitical clash of class created by the expansion of the global upper-middle-class, a plausible alternative hypothesis.

        <title>The Evolution of “Loaded Moments” Toward Escalation or De-Escalation in Student–Teacher Interactions</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;To minimize negative interactions and their impacts, teachers and students must successfully negotiate loaded moments, points in time when two or more parties realize that their needs differ and that they must confront that difference. In this literature review, we synthesize 30 studies, published from 2000 to 2020, that describe the evolution of loaded moments between teachers and students with the goal of identifying and explicating the co-construction of escalation and de-escalation during classroom interactions. We found that macro level social contexts and existing classroom patterns set the scene for the occurrence of a loaded moment. In addition, loaded moments emerge when specific instigating circumstances are co-constructed, which refer to incompatibilities between teacher and student(s). Furthermore, loaded moments (de)escalate, depending on the co-construction of the moment as it progresses, such as through mutual trade-offs, turnings, or refusals. Finally, these co-constructions can result in a specific long-term relationship- and bond-development. Implications of these findings for research concerning student–teacher conflict are discussed.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study analyzed the variation in teachers’ mathematical educational values between distance and traditional face-to-face teaching. Enabled by the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the research explored the impact of remote teaching on primary and secondary mathematics education in Hong Kong. An online survey, completed by 109 practicing mathematics teachers, assessed their pre-existing educational values and their adaptability to the shift towards distance teaching, as well as their teaching practices. Findings indicated that despite the multitude of digital teaching tools, the implementation of most mathematical educational values was more restricted in distance teaching. Rationalism and Control were prioritized, reflecting the challenges of assessing student progress remotely. Among the 13 values identified, Fun and Engagement, along with Thinking and Problem-solving, Achievement, and Reasoning, were significantly diminished, highlighting the shortcomings of one-way and superficial concept-based teaching. The study concludes that distance teaching, when completely isolated from traditional methods, may not offer the benefits suggested in the literature, impacting student engagement, motivation, and higher-order thinking. This necessitates a unique curriculum development model to effectively incorporate blended and self-directed learning.&lt;/p&gt;
