        <title>Effective Teacher Professional Development: New Theory and a Meta-Analytic Test</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Multiple meta-analyses have now documented small positive effects of teacher professional development (PD) on pupil test scores. However, the field lacks any validated explanatory account of what differentiates more from less effective in-service training. As a result, researchers have little in the way of advice for those tasked with designing or commissioning better PD. We set out to remedy this by developing a new theory of effective PD based on combinations of causally active components targeted at developing teachers’ insights, motivating change, developing teaching techniques, and then embedding these changes in teachers’ practice. We test two important implications of the theory using data identified through a systematic review and meta-analysis of 104 randomized controlled trials, finding qualified empirical support for the theory. The main contribution of the article is to provide a testable theory of what makes PD more effective, which can be used to guide future empirical research on this topic.

        <title>The Postsecondary Future Selves of Black and Latinx Boys: A Case for Cultivating More Expansive Supports in College-Going Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Black and Latinx adolescent boys from economically stratified communities face pervasive societal inequities and, therefore, deserve more responsive school supports to determine and actualize postsecondary pathways. For insights into how such students conceptualize their futures and their school’s role in facilitating this process, this ethnographic study investigated one urban school’s college-going culture and its impact on shaping what the author calls participants’ postsecondary future selves. This theoretical approach encompasses three domains: college (i.e., postsecondary education), career (i.e., post-college employment trajectory), and condition (i.e., expected financial stability, relational and familial prospects, future living arrangements, happiness, and joy). Implications suggest that college-going school practitioners widen supports so students can imagine and envision how college ambitions align with career and condition goals.

        <title>Calibrating Items Using an Unfolding Model of Item Response Theory: The Case of the Trait Personality Questionnaire 5 (TPQue5)</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Unfolding item response theory (IRT) models are important alternatives to dominance IRT models in describing the response processes on self-report tests. Their usage is common in personality measures, since they indicate potential differentiations in test score interpretation. This paper aims to gain a better insight into the structure of trait personality, by investigating whether the dominance or alternatively the unfolding IRT model are better descriptors of the response processes on a personality measure constructed under the dominance response theorem. For the assessment of the dominant model, the Graded Response Model (GRM) is used; while for the unfolding model, the Generalized Graded Unfolding Model (GGUM) was examined. All analyses are conducted with the freely available R. A sample of 1340 Greek adults, employed in private and public organizations, fulfilled the Trait Personality Questionnaire 5 short-form (TPQue5). Findings contradict previous research on trait personality. In accordance to the construction method employed, the TPQue5 items are best understood by monotonically increasing item response functions (IRFs). Individuals responding to the TPQue5 increase their probability of endorsing its items as their trait level increases; this stands for all personality dimensions, although Openness to Experience exhibited mixed type of item response patterns. Further research directions, implications and limitations are also discussed.

        <title>Are Effective Teachers for Students With Disabilities Effective Teachers for All?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The success of students with disabilities (SWDs) depends on access to high-quality general education teachers. Yet, teacher value-added measures (VAMs) generally fail to distinguish between effectiveness in educating students with or without disabilities. Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, we create two VAMs: one focusing on teachers’ effectiveness for SWDs and one for non-SWDs. We find that many top-performing teachers for non-SWDs have relatively lower VAMs for SWDs and vice versa, and that on average SWDs have teachers with lower scores in both VAMs than non-SWDs. Overall, SWD-specific VAMs may be more suitable for identifying which teachers have a history of effectiveness with SWDs and could play a role in informing student assignment to teachers.

        <title>Describing a teacher’s pedagogical mathematical knowledge in STEM teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Describing and analyzing teaching practice has been a focus of researchers interested in the interaction and connections between teachers’ content knowledge and their pedagogical knowledge. This study described the role of a teacher’s mathematical content and pedagogical content knowledge in involving students in learning and solving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) problems in an Australian primary school context. The Knowledge Quartet (KQ) is a widely recognised framework originally developed to observe classroom mathematics teaching and analyze mathematics teaching practices. We use the KQ as a theoretical/organizational framework against which to thematically analyze one teacher’s classroom pedagogy to investigate 1) the utility of the KQ framework for describing and analyzing a teacher’s mathematical lesson within an integrated STEM inquiry context and 2) how a teacher’s pedagogical mathematical knowledge supports a focus on inquiry-based STEM integrated teaching. The study involved a teacher and 26 Year 5 students in an Australian classroom. Data included classroom video recordings, researcher observation notes, and students’ artefacts. The video recordings were transcribed and analyzed using the KQ framework. The observation notes and artefacts were used to validate and support this analysis. The paper identifies and provides examples of different aspects of the KQ in the teaching sequence and provides examples of how integrated STEM content can be effectively incorporated into the primary school classroom. The relevance and significance of the KQ framework and the teaching of integrated STEM content in primary school are reviewed and discussed within the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Simple Technique Assessing Ordinal and Disordinal Interaction Effects</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Previous research explicates ordinal and disordinal interactions through the concept of the “crossover point.” This point is determined via simple regression models of a focal predictor at specific moderator values and signifies the intersection of these models. An interaction effect is labeled as disordinal (or ordinal) when the crossover point falls within (or outside) the observable range of the focal predictor. However, this approach might yield erroneous conclusions due to the crossover point’s intrinsic nature as a random variable defined by mean and variance. To statistically evaluate ordinal and disordinal interactions, a comparison between the observable range and the confidence interval (CI) of the crossover point is crucial. Numerous methods for establishing CIs, including reparameterization and bootstrap techniques, exist. Yet, these alternative methods are scarcely employed in social science journals for assessing ordinal and disordinal interactions. This note introduces a straightforward approach for calculating CIs, leveraging an extension of the Johnson–Neyman technique.

        <title>Simpler standard errors for two-stage optimization estimators revisited</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 1057-1061, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;“Simpler standard errors for two-stage optimization estimators” (Terza, 2016a, Stata Journal 16: 368–385) offers an analytic simplification of the daunting textbook formulations of the asymptotic variance–covariance matrix of a class of two-stage optimization estimators. Here I revisit that simplification and show that it applies to a much broader class of estimators than was originally considered. I also offer a correction that further enhances the generality of this asymptotic variance–covariance matrix formulation. These points are illustrated via a real-data application.

        <title>pystacked: Stacking generalization and machine learning in Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 909-931, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The pystacked command implements stacked generalization (Wolpert, 1992, Neural Networks 5: 241–259) for regression and binary classification via Python’s scikit-learn. Stacking combines multiple supervised machine learners—the “base” or “level-0” learners—into one learner. The currently supported base learners include regularized regression, random forest, gradient boosted trees, support vector machines, and feed-forward neural nets (multilayer perceptron). pystacked can also be used as a “regular” machine learning program to fit one base learner and thus provides an easy-to-use application programming interface for scikit-learn‘s machine learning algorithms.

        <title>ardl: Estimating autoregressive distributed lag and equilibrium correction models</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 983-1019, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;We present a command, ardl, for the estimation of autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models in a time-series context. The ardl command can be used to fit an ARDL model with the optimal number of autoregressive and distributed lags based on the Akaike or Bayesian (Schwarz) information criterion. The regression results can be displayed in the ARDL levels form or in the error-correction representation of the model. The latter separates long-run and short-run effects and is available in two different parameterizations of the long-run (cointegrating) relationship. The popular bounds-testing procedure for the existence of a long-run levels relationship is implemented as a postestimation feature. Comprehensive critical values and approximate p-values obtained from response-surface regressions facilitate statistical inference.

        <title>Data management and techniques for best–worst discrete choice experiments</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 1020-1044, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we present software that is suitable for use with Stata’s choice modeling suite of commands, which begin with cm. Within the context of choice models, we focus on best–worst data. In such data, respondents are presented a set of choices and are required to select a best and a worst choice from among the alternatives. Optionally, respondents may indicate an opt-out choice, in which no best or worst choice exists in the choice set. Such data are simplified versions of experiments in which respondents rank all the choices. Once best–worst data are collected, there are specific types of data expansions that analysts use to take advantage of both explicit and implicit information. The commands described in this article support data expansion and model estimation.

        <title>csa2sls: A complete subset approach for many instruments using Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 932-941, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;We developed a command, csa2sls, that implements the complete subset averaging two-stage least-squares (CSA2SLS) estimator in Lee and Shin (2021, Econometrics Journal 24: 290–314). The CSA2SLS estimator is an alternative to the two-stage least-squares estimator that remedies the bias issue caused by many correlated instruments. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations and confirm that the CSA2SLS estimator reduces both the mean squared error and the estimation bias substantially when instruments are correlated. We illustrate the usage of csa2sls in Stata with an empirical application.

            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/23/4&quot;&gt;Volume 23, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 1086-1095, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Percentage breakdowns for a series of classes or categories are sometimes reported without a specification of class frequencies or even the total sample size. This column surveys the problem of estimating the minimum sample size and class frequencies consistent with a reported breakdown and a particular resolution. I introduce and explain a new command, find_denom. Rounding quirks whereby a total is reported as above or below 100% are discussed as a complication.
