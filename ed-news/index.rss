        <title>The Alignment Agenda: Examining the Movement to Bridge the Early Childhood and K–12 Sectors</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;There is a movement to improve alignment between the early childhood and K–12 education sectors, which I term The Alignment Agenda. This qualitative study provides an in-depth description of this agenda through analysis of data from interviews with 25 elites (e.g., state director of early learning) associated with the agenda and associated documents. The analysis focuses on (1) the problems with the status quo that necessitate alignment reform, (2) the nature of proposed alignment reforms, and (3) the challenges and facilitators of advancing the alignment reforms. Understanding how elites associated with the alignment agenda think about the movement, including key features of alignment reforms, has relevance for policy and practice because these individuals are closely—if not directly—involved in the process of policy development and implementation at the local, state, and federal levels. Further, attention to the topic of aligning the early childhood and K–12 education sectors is likely to increase in coming years as proposals for expansion of the early childhood education sector are adopted and implemented.

        <title>How Does Schooling Affect Inequality in Cognitive Skills? The View From Seasonal Comparison Research</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A small subset of education studies analyzes school data collected seasonally (separating the summer from the school year). At first, this work was primarily known for documenting learning loss in the summers, but scholars have since recognized that observing how inequality changes between summer and school periods provides leverage for understanding how schools influence inequality. Results based on this analytic technique confirm current views in some ways, but in other ways the patterns challenge existing wisdom. For example, Black/White gaps in math and reading skills often grow faster when school is in versus out, consistent with the view that schools exacerbate racial inequality. But socioeconomic gaps produce the opposite pattern, suggesting that schools are compensatory across this dimension. In this review, I consider the logic behind seasonal research, the empirical patterns it has produced, and the kinds of new questions it motivates.

        <title>Language, Comfort Speaking, and Collaboration: A QuantCrit Analysis of Multilingual Students’ Experiences in Introductory College Mathematics Courses</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Active learning practices, like groupwork, are becoming more widely used in post-secondary mathematics classrooms. These practices are often talk-intensive and require interpersonal interactions. As such, it remains an open question the extent to which practices like groupwork equitably support students with different social identities, including identities that center language. The goal of this paper is to use critical quantitative methodology to analyze the experiences of students in introductory college mathematics courses, particularly in courses that require peer collaboration. The data for this paper stems from surveys completed by 464 undergraduate students with different language backgrounds. The analysis identifies relationships that existed between the identities students brought to the classroom and the identities they developed in introductory mathematics courses. Using linear regression models, the study found that students’ comfort speaking during class and the language they preferred to do mathematics in were associated with practice-linked identities, like sense of belonging among peers. Findings also suggest an interaction between these variables and the frequency that students engaged in peer collaboration. This study contributes to the growing body of literature documenting how students with marginalized identities may have differential experiences with active learning practices, like groupwork.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Eighteenth Annual AERA Brown Lecture in Education Research Still Climbing the Hill: Intersectional Reflections on Brown and Beyond</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman’s poem “The Hill We Climb”—among the most powerful moments of the 2021 presidential inauguration—inspired the central inquiry of the 18th Annual Brown Lecture in Education Research: Why are we still climbing the hill of educational equity 67 years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education? The purpose of this article is to challenge dominant narratives surrounding Brown and introduce perspectives that might help account for a general lack of progress—perspectives that typically are overlooked or erased in wider Brown discourses. Inspired by her poem, Patton Davis offers a scholarly analysis and contributes a robust understanding of Brown and its historical and contemporary meanings in the sociopolitical contexts of racism and white supremacy. Patton Davis considers pressing questions: How can study of the circumstances that have intensified the COVID-19 pandemic fuel collective understanding of racial inequities and intersectional injustices in education? How might a critical race lens guide educators, policymakers, and researchers toward a more progressive realization of the promises of Brown? What would it take for education researchers, the majority of whom are situated in postsecondary settings, to engage in activism modeled after the work of communities still fighting for the racial and educational equity envisioned in Brown?

        <title>Investing in the Teacher Workforce: Experimental Evidence on Teachers’ Preferences</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Inadequate compensation is often viewed as the root of teacher workforce challenges despite teacher reports that working conditions matter more. Using an original discrete choice experiment with a national sample of 1,030 U.S. teachers, we found that support staff—special education specialists, counselors, and nurses—play an essential role in shaping teachers’ employment preferences. Teachers value access to these support staff more than they value a 10% increase to their own salary. We also assessed teachers’ preferences regarding childcare subsidies and find that teachers treat a 10% salary increase and a childcare benefit of similar value as near perfect substitutes. To test the durability of these findings, we replicated our study 2 years later and found nearly identical results.

        <title>A review of lesson study in mathematics education from 2015 to 2022: implementation and impact</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lesson study (LS), a teacher-oriented, student-focused professional development (PD) approach that originated in Japan, has spread globally. However, existing literature on the implementation of LS and its effectiveness provides inconsistent results, suggesting a need to review current research on LS. With a focus on LS in mathematics education, we examined 75 recent LS studies using Lewis’s (ZDM Mathematics Education 48:571–580, 2016. &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus non-url-ref&quot;&gt;doi.org/10.1007/s11858-016-0792-x&lt;/span&gt;) framework to understand how LS is implemented and the pathways by which LS can impact teaching practice and student learning. We found that new developments have taken place in LS implementation, although challenges persist throughout its process. Regarding the implementation of LS, even though the examined LS studies generally contained four phases (study, plan, teach, and reflect), we found many LS lacked a research question, and the study of teaching materials was sometimes invisible. Across phases, studies shared a consensus that it is most critical to focus on students’ thinking and learning, yet reported challenges in maintaining this focus. In addition, the role of knowledgeable others (KOs) was recognized but inconsistently understood. Collaboration was also widely reported as a challenge. Finally, there were large variations in LS duration, with some LS implementing overly brief cycles. Regarding LS impact, the literature has more frequently reported changes in teachers’ knowledge and beliefs and less frequently in curriculum, learning community/professional norms, teaching practice, and student learning outcomes. The above challenges reflect a need for culturally relevant systemic support for developing sustainable and large-scale LS. We suggest future directions for continued research and practice improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Early numeracy opportunities through number stories with marginalised families</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We explore the potential of merging numeracy and literacy, through using number stories to stimulate mathematical engagement with young, marginalized learners in their communities. Our data emerges from the Family Maths Storytime Programme (FMSP) run in partnership with teachers in two South African schools. The FMSP conducted sessions with caregivers of pre-Grade 1 learners that focused on supporting mathematical talk in the home centred around four number storybooks with linked activities and games. Drawing on Bourdieu’s notion of habitus and other socio-cultural theories emphasising opportunities for talk and reasoning for learning we explore: Did the FMSP enable the integration of home and school numeracy and literacy practices? If so, what evidence is there of such integrated practices? What is the nature of the described practices? Our analysis focuses on 20 caregiver interviews following their participation in the FMSP that was initially run after school in two English medium pre-Grade 1 classrooms. NVivo coding highlighted key themes across interviews. The findings show how modelling engagement with merged literacy and numeracy practices in the programme enabled changing practices, dispositions, and forms of capital in relation to engaging with these in the home. We highlight how supporting home-based and story inspired engagement with marginalised learners supports equity goals in contexts where learners from indigenous backgrounds often begin and remain mathematically behind grade expectations in school.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Impacts of Viewpoint Diversity Law on Teaching and Learning in Florida’s State Universities</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study explores the impact of Florida House Bill 233 on teaching and learning in Florida’s State University System. This bill purports to promote intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by permitting students to record classes and by creating a cause of action for faculty violating these principles. Faculty were invited to share qualitative feedback about the specific impacts of the two provisions. The vast majority of faculty expressed negative views of these provisions, suggesting they would inhibit intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by deterring student participation in classes, discouraging faculty from engaging students in discussions of certain topics, and creating an atmosphere of mistrust between faculty and students. Faculty with positive views of the recording provision suggested that these provisions promote intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity by discouraging faculty from imposing their views and giving students a remedy if they feel that faculty are violating their rights.

        <title>Mixed-Effects Location Scale Models for Joint Modeling School Value-Added Effects on the Mean and Variance of Student Achievement</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;School value-added models are widely applied to study, monitor, and hold schools to account for school differences in student learning. The traditional model is a mixed-effects linear regression of student current achievement on student prior achievement, background characteristics, and a school random intercept effect. The latter is referred to as the school value-added score and measures the mean student covariate-adjusted achievement in each school. In this article, we argue that further insights may be gained by additionally studying the variance in this quantity in each school. These include the ability to identify both individual schools and school types that exhibit unusually high or low variability in student achievement, even after accounting for differences in student intakes. We explore and illustrate how this can be done via fitting mixed-effects location scale versions of the traditional school value-added model. We discuss the implications of our work for research and school accountability systems.

        <title>A Comparison of Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Educational Measurement</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Topic models are mathematical and statistical models used to analyze textual data. The objective of topic models is to gain information about the latent semantic space of a set of related textual data. The semantic space of a set of textual data contains the relationship between documents and words and how they are used. Topic models are becoming more common in educational measurement research as a method for analyzing students’ responses to constructed-response items. Two popular topic models are latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LSA uses linear algebra techniques, whereas LDA uses an assumed statistical model and generative process. In educational measurement, LSA is often used in algorithmic scoring of essays due to its high reliability and agreement with human raters. LDA is often used as a supplemental analysis to gain additional information about students, such as their thinking and reasoning. This article reviews and compares the LSA and LDA topic models. This article also introduces a methodology for comparing the semantic spaces obtained by the two models and uses a simulation study to investigate their similarities.

        <title>Relational-Curiosity and Mathematics: A Dynamic Exploration of DataViz</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper examines preservice teachers’ experiences when they engage with tasks using dynamic technological applets to analyse data pertaining to societal issues. We examine two vignettes that discuss preservice teachers’ interaction with dynamic visual representations of data related to plastic pollution and food supply. We analyse this data with an eye toward the relationship between the affordances of the technology and the emergence of participants’ curiosity. We adopt the Embodied Curiosity theoretical lens to show how the foundational construct, relational-curiosity, provides opportunities for curiosity to be visible and recognized as a tool for meaning-making. This research provides insights into how preservice teachers can mitigate the challenges and tensions they face when navigating connections between mathematics and social justice issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Relationships Between State Higher Education Funding Strategies and College Access and Success</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We compiled the first longitudinal data set with detailed state funding information to examine whether different funding strategies for public higher education correlate with college access and completion, with a focus on outcomes among racially minoritized students. We found no relationships between funding mechanisms and student outcomes at public universities. However, at community colleges, we found that funding strategies that combine base adjustments and enrollment or performance components may increase enrollment, but not completions.

        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Tutoring ranks among the most versatile and potentially transformative educational tools available. Dozens of randomized experiments have evaluated preK–12 tutoring programs, varying widely in approaches, contexts, and costs. This article presents results from a systematic review and meta-analysis of tutoring field experiments. We develop a framework for understanding variation in tutoring program impact and examine effect sizes (ESs) across a range of characteristics. We find that tutoring programs yield consistently substantial positive impacts on learning, with an overall pooled ES of 0.288 SD (SE = 0.029, p &amp;lt; .001). ESs tend to be largest for programs that use teachers or paraprofessionals as tutors, are held in earlier grades, occur at least 3 days per week, and are held during school.
