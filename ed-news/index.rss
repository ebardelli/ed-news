        <title>Incouple numbers and dedómetros: listening for meaning in bilingual children’s mathematical lexical inventions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous research on bilingual mathematics education has proposed that as children “language mathematics” they use multiple sources of meaning. In this paper, we focus on lexical inventions—bilingual children’s made up words that are not formally defined or used but follow the phonology and morphology of a language—as a source of meaning. Consistent with tenets from translanguaging, we recognize lexical inventions as a creative language practice defying idealized language norms. A raciolinguistic theoretical perspective informs our interpretation of children, teachers, and researchers as listening subjects. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mathematical lexical inventions can prompt a translanguaging space where children, teachers, and researchers resist listening subject positions that predispose them to listen for predetermined language practices. Drawing on two lesson transcripts, one from a fourth-grade English-immersion classroom in Colombia and one from a third-grade Spanish-immersion classroom in the United States, we used moment analysis in translanguaging spaces to identify spontaneous and critical moments where lexical inventions prompted mathematical explorations. We argue for adopting listening subject positions as learners of transgressive language practices that are part of interactions between children and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Impacts of Three Educational Technologies on Algebraic Understanding in the Context of COVID-19</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The current study investigated the effectiveness of three distinct educational technologies—two game-based applications (From Here to There and DragonBox 12+) and two modes of online problem sets in ASSISTments (an Immediate Feedback condition and an Active Control condition with no immediate feedback) on Grade 7 students’ algebraic knowledge. More than 3,600 Grade 7 students across nine in-person and one virtual schools within the same district were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Students received nine 30-minute intervention sessions from September 2020 to March 2021. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of the final analytic sample (N = 1,850) showed significantly higher posttest scores for students who used From Here to There and DragonBox 12+ compared to the Active Control condition. No significant difference was found for the Immediate Feedback condition. The findings have implications for understanding how game-based applications can affect algebraic understanding, even within pandemic pressures on learning.

        <title>The Effect of Right to Work Laws on Union Membership and School Resources: Evidence from 1942–2017</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the Janus v. AFCSME (2018) decision, the U.S. Supreme Court mandated that all public sector workers, including teachers, operate in a Right to Work (RTW) framework. In the years since, teachers’ unions have not experienced the mass exodus that some predicted, but should we expect them to? Using an original, historical data set spanning 1942–2017, I examine the effect of prior RTW policies on teachers’ union membership and school expenditures. I find that RTW policies decrease teachers’ union membership by roughly 43% and reduce educational expenditures by nearly $800 per pupil. Importantly, effects take roughly 10 years to clearly materialize. Additional analyses provide support for the notion that effects on school resources are driven, in part, by effects on union membership.

        <title>Diagnosing Primary Students’ Reading Progression: Is Cognitive Diagnostic Computerized Adaptive Testing the Way Forward?</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) is a cutting-edge technology in educational measurement that targets at providing feedback on examinees’ strengths and weaknesses while increasing test accuracy and efficiency. To date, most CD-CAT studies have made methodological progress under simulated conditions, but little has applied CD-CAT to real educational assessment. The present study developed a Chinese reading comprehension item bank tapping into six validated reading attributes, with 195 items calibrated using data of 28,485 second to sixth graders and the item-level cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs). The measurement precision and efficiency of the reading CD-CAT system were compared and optimized in terms of crucial CD-CAT settings, including the CDMs for calibration, item selection methods, and termination rules. The study identified seven dominant reading attribute mastery profiles that stably exist across grades. These major clusters of readers and their variety with grade indicated some sort of reading developmental mechanisms that advance and deepen step by step at the primary school level. Results also suggested that compared to traditional linear tests, CD-CAT significantly improved the classification accuracy without imposing much testing burden. These findings may elucidate the multifaceted nature and possible learning paths of reading and raise the question of whether CD-CAT is applicable to other educational domains where there is a need to provide formative and fine-grained feedback but where there is a limited amount of test time.

        <title>Using Item Scores and Distractors to Detect Item Compromise and Preknowledge</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Any time examinees have had access to items and/or answers prior to taking a test, the fairness of the test and validity of test score interpretations are threatened. Therefore, there is a high demand for procedures to detect both compromised items (CI) and examinees with preknowledge (EWP). In this article, we develop a procedure that uses item scores and distractors to simultaneously detect CI and EWP. The false positive rate and true positive rate are evaluated for both items and examinees using detailed simulations. A real data example is also provided using data from an information technology certification exam.

        <title>Pre-paring for ambitious mathematics teaching: examining the role of video in supporting mathematics teacher educators</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers (PTs) should provide them with opportunities to deepen their understanding of and develop productive dispositions toward mathematics. Supporting mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) to learn how to develop practices that create rich learning opportunities for novice teachers comprises a challenge for our field. This analysis examines an unconventional professional learning experience for MTEs: viewing video of experienced teacher educators enacting the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;same lessons&lt;/em&gt; that they would enact with their own PTs. We examined how viewing videos embedded in a larger set of supports developed by the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Elementary Mathematics Project&lt;/em&gt; (EMP) impacted MTEs’ actions when planning or enacting the lessons. EMP also includes high-quality curriculum materials to use with PTs and instructional guides to support their enactment. Twelve MTEs were interviewed about their experience viewing video clips to help them to engage in preparation (Mason, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r37&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/span&gt;) as they prepared to enact EMP lessons. MTEs’ noticings included how prospective teachers engage with the mathematics and one another and how the expert MTEs supported prospective teacher interactions and aspects of the classroom environment. MTEs connected the actions they identified to broader principles of teaching, offering a rationale for each and hypothesizing how it impacted the instruction. Importantly, through watching video, MTEs generated conceptual resources (e.g., identifying questions asked in the video that they wanted to try out), which they reported allowed them to respond to prospective teachers in the moment when teaching. Implications for using video to support MTE development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Flow of a Proof - Capturing the Elusive Whole</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We propose the ‘flow of a proof’ as a construct that relates to the balance lecturers achieve in their presentation between the proof as a whole and its different parts, taking into account various aspects (informal, contextual) of proof classroom presentation. We conducted expert interviews in which we presented two different proofs of the same theorem to five experienced tertiary level mathematics lecturers and asked them to reflect on features of these proofs and of proofs in general, and on their considerations and practices when teaching proofs. The lecturers related to a rich collection of proof features and pedagogical considerations. Our findings demonstrate the subjectivity of lecturers’ considerations as well as tensions they experience between striving towards mathematical accuracy and adjusting the proof presentation to their students; these tensions influence the flow of the proof, which is an outcome of the choices that the lecturers make. We discuss our findings in light of existing literature about mathematicians’ pedagogical considerations and the existence of a shared pedagogical culture.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The validity of causal claims with repeated measures designs: A within-study comparison evaluation of differences-in-differences and the comparative interrupted time series</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Modern policies are commonly evaluated not with randomized experiments but with repeated measures designs like difference-in-differences (DID) and the comparative interrupted time series (CITS). The key benefit of these designs is that they control for unobserved confounders that are fixed over time. However, DID and CITS designs only result in unbiased impact estimates when the model assumptions are consistent with the data at hand. In this paper, we empirically test whether the assumptions of repeated measures designs are met in field settings. Using a within-study comparison design, we compare experimental estimates of the impact of patient-directed care on medical expenditures to non-experimental DID and CITS estimates for the same target population and outcome. Our data come from a multi-site experiment that includes participants receiving Medicaid in Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey. We present summary measures of repeated measures bias across three states, four comparison groups, two model specifications, and two outcomes. We find that, on average, bias resulting from repeated measures designs are very close to zero (less than 0.01 standard deviations; SDs). Further, we find that comparison groups which have pre-treatment trends that are visibly parallel to the treatment group result in less bias than those with visibly divergent trends. However, CITS models that control for baseline trends produced slightly more bias and were less precise than DID models that only control for baseline means. Overall, we offer optimistic evidence in favor of repeated measures designs when randomization is not feasible.

        <title>Examining the Effects of Renewable Energy and Economic Growth on Carbon Emission in Canada: Evidence from the Nonlinear ARDL Approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Increasing industrial activities trigger the intense use of fossil fuels and increase the number of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Countries with a high share in current carbon emissions need to expand their use of renewable energy sources. Canada is an important energy producer and consumer globally. In this regard, its decisions are important for the future development of global emissions. This study examines the asymmetric effects of economic growth, renewable energy, and non-renewable energy consumption on carbon emissions in Canada from 1965 to 2017. In the first stage of the analysis, unit root testing was performed for the variables. For this, Lee-Strazicich (2003), ADF and PP unit root tests were used. The nonlinear ARDL method was used to analyze the relationship between variables. and Measures: In order to analyze the relationship between the variables in the established model, renewable energy consumption (%), non-renewable energy consumption (%), and carbon emissions (per capita-Mt). In addition, the economic growth (constant price 2010- US$) parameter was added to the model as a control variable. The findings support that energy consumption, economic growth, and renewable energy have an asymmetric effect on carbon emissions in the long run. The positive shock in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, and a unit increase in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions by 1.29%. Besides, the negative shock in economic growth greatly deteriorates the quality of the environment; that is, a 1% reduction in economic growth causes emissions to increase by 0.74% in the long run. On the other hand, positive shocks in energy consumption have a positive and significant effect on carbon emissions. A 1% increase in energy consumption causes 1.69% carbon emissions. There are important policy implications for Canada to eliminate carbon emissions, increase the share of renewable energy sources and achieve its economic growth targets. In addition, Canada needs to reduce its consumption of non-renewable energy (such as gasoline coal, diesel, and natural gas).

        <title>Title IX Policy Implementation and Sexual Harassment Prevalence in K-12 Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examined the prevalence of student-to-student and staff-to-student sexual harassment in K-12 schools and school district compliance with Title IX using a retrospective survey of young adults. Participants (n = 511) were asked to describe their knowledge of policies and procedures regarding Title IX, the prevalence of sexual harassment, and the school’s observed response to harassment using a 34-item, anonymous online survey. Descriptive statistics revealed that 13.4% of participants perceived that sexual harassment at their K-12 school district was at a “moderate” or “high” level, 50.1% reported that they either knew someone who experienced sexual harassment by a school employee or experienced it themselves, and 17.4% (n = 89) of individuals personally experienced one or more incident of staff-to-student sexual harassment. Nearly all (94%) students were unable to identify their Title IX compliance officer and 70% were unaware of how to file grievances. School districts without policies and materials that address sexual harassment had statistically significantly higher rates of harassment than school districts with policies (p = .01) and materials (p &amp;lt; .01).

        <title>Pipeline Philanthropy: Understanding Philanthropic Corporate Action in Education During the COVID-19 Era and Beyond</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In response to COVID-19 many companies, particularly technology companies, voluntarily attended to the strained education sector by donating or temporarily discounting their core products, generating public support and gratitude. This type of philanthropic corporate action demonstrates an expansive and perhaps increasing function in the provisioning of certain educational materials and resources by private actors. This article analyzes this strand of corporate activity as pipeline philanthropy and shows how this model of strategic corporate giving differs from existing models of philanthropy in education. Through illustrations this study assesses the democratic implications of corporate entanglement through philanthropic action to evaluate whether the benefits brought about by an enhanced role for corporate actors in education are worth what they compromise.

        <title>Norms of mathematical definitions: imposing constraints, permitting choice, or both?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Definitions play an important role in mathematics by stipulating objects of interest to mathematicians in order to facilitate theory building. Nevertheless, limited research has examined how mathematicians approach writing definitions or the values of the mathematical community that are upheld through norms related to definition use and writing. Based on interviews with nine algebraists/category theorists, we characterize two mathematical values upheld through definitions: clarity in and for communication and freedom of choice in the use and writing of definitions. Further results highlight the norms and values related to defining that participants do and do not claim to discuss through their instruction, including a clear emphasis on precision and rigor in mathematics but limited attempts to show that definitions are created by people to serve their needs. Implications include a need for providing instructional opportunities for students to engage with more mathematical values in order to better understand what algebraists do.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trends in Parents’ Time Investment at Children’s Schools During a Period of Economic Change</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This paper examines changes from 1996–2019 in U.S. parents’ time investment at their children’s schools using data from the National Household Education Survey (N ≈ 116,000). The most common way parents spend time at their child’s school is by attending a general school meeting, which rose from 76% to 85% over this period. The proportion who volunteered at school rose slightly over time (36% to 38%), whereas the frequency of participating in school activities decreased slightly. Little change emerged in the proportion who attend a PTA/PTO meeting (~50%), whereas the proportion who spent time fundraising decreased (60% to 54%). Differences in time investment between high- versus low-income parents either narrowed significantly (attended school meetings, frequency of participation) or remained stable (attended PTO/PTA meeting, volunteered) over time, except for income-based differences in time spent fundraising for their child’s school, which grew significantly. We discuss factors possibly related to these narrowing and persistent gaps.

        <title>Preparing Cherokee Language Teachers: Lessons Learned From an Innovative Licensure Program</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Cherokee is an endangered Indigenous language. Revitalization efforts often include offering Cherokee language instruction, but these efforts have been hampered by a lack of qualified teachers. An initial licensure program was launched in fall 2019 aimed at supporting Cherokee language renewal via the preparation of teachers. While a step forward, little is known about this program and the extent to which it meets the needs of Cherokee language teacher candidates. In response, we conducted a year-long case study to chronicle the experiences of a Cherokee language teacher as he completes this program. Results confirmed that teachers of Indigenous languages may still be developing language proficiency and may lack resources, rendering instruction more challenging. Findings also shed light on beneficial program characteristics (e.g., attention to lesson and unit plan design) and emphasized the need for greater involvement of the Indigenous community in teacher preparation programs.

        <title>Beyond Making a Statement: An Intersectional Framing of the Power and Possibilities of Positioning</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this essay, two women of Color researchers examine the intersections of race and disability and ask, “What is the power and purpose of positioning and positionality statements?” Informed by Black feminist theory, and drawing from the DisCrit tenets of intersectional oppressions, historicity, and whiteness and ability as property, the authors focus on researchers’ positioning in relation to how they engage and communicate knowledge about multiply marginalized people. Positionality statements, they argue, must be more than a listing of identities or a claim on authority through the naming of professional proximity to marginalized communities. Recognizing the increasing expectations for education scholars to articulate positionality in their scholarship, the authors offer a three-pronged intersectional framework, with provocations about the onto-epistemic, sociohistoric, and sociocultural elements of positioning. Education researchers interested in conveying how intersectional oppressions effect knowledge production will find this framework useful for crafting positionality statements that consider the multidimensional nature of power, oppression, and research in relation to their field, the literature, and multiply marginalized participants.

        <title>The development of high school students’ statistical literacy across grade level</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The capacity to interrogate data with critical thinking is a strong predictor of statistical literacy (SL). This data interrogation, from the data consumers’ perspective, incorporates four complex response skills: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;communicating&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/em&gt;, and those skills are strongly supported by students’ appreciation of three interrelated knowledge components (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;text and context&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;statistical-mathematical knowledge&lt;/em&gt;). Due to the need to be critical data-information readers, students’ SL should develop during their formal schooling. The aim of this paper was to investigate differences in SL between Indonesian year 9 and year 12 students and between female and male students. The same test was administered to 48 year 9 students (50% females) and 48 year 12 students (50% females) from 16 different schools in Indonesia. Findings revealed that the highest percentage of year 9 and 12 students demonstrated evidence of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;consistent but non-critical&lt;/em&gt; thinking (level 4), suggesting that they exhibited their statistical knowledge but not in critical ways. There were 42% of year 9 students showing limited statistical thinking (levels 1 to 3) compared to 17% of year 12 students. Furthermore, while there were no significant gender differences in students’ SL and its all skills, the study shows significant grade level differences in overall SL as well as in its skills except &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt;. Implications of this study include the development of a framework that provides a coherent assessment of students’ SL from a data consumers’ perspective, along with suggestions for classroom teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creativity of an Aha! Moment and Mathematics Education </title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Creativity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;of an Aha! Moment and Mathematics Education&lt;/em&gt; presents the implementation of Bisociation and constructivist theory into mathematics learning in school and college. The book has two goals: (1) to look into classroom facilitation, emergence, and depth of knowledge assessment of an Aha! Moment insight, and (2) to look into the connections between Bisociation theory and the fields of creativity and learning theories. This edited volume consists of empirical and conceptual studies comprehensively and in-depth about the creativity of Aha! Moments. This book is the first book that contains the application of Aha! Moments that will certainly encourage readers from mathematics and natural science teachers, human creativity researchers, librarians, and computer experts to dig deeper into the concept and application of creativity Aha! Moments. The volume’s editors hope that readers will have new opportunities to reflect on the critical role of creativity in learning and teaching mathematics at schools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“There Was Nothing Here”: School Leaders Using Dual Language Bilingual Education Programs as a Formula to Re-Engineer Student Populations for School Turnaround</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;New York City offers an example of the national trend to expand dual language bilingual education (DLBE) programs, yet only a small proportion of multilingual learners are enrolled in these programs in city schools. Our examination of new DLBE programs in three city schools builds on research about the “gentrification” of DLBE. Specifically, our findings show how school leaders opened DLBE programs to re-engineer the demographics of their student population by enrolling more White, privileged students in the name of “school turnaround”—namely, to increase enrollment and popularity in a school choice context and improve performance on accountability measures.
