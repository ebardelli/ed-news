        <title>Policy Solutions: Transgender students: Navigating the politics</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-61, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Superintendents increasingly are leaving their positions over pressure and vitriol in their communities over culture war issues, such as critical race theory and supports for LGBTQ+ students. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins performed two studies revealing that when policies on transgender students are framed as protection from violence, more people support those policies, regardless of their political affiliation. These considerations could help districts support transgender students without tension and controversy in their communities.

        <title>Under the law: A case for social and emotional learning</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Social-emotional learning (SEL) has been a staple in U.S. schools for decades, but it’s recently drawn criticism from policy makers and advocates who believe these programs represent government intrusion into areas best reserved for families. Robert Kim describes some of the legal arguments that support the use of SEL in schools. SEL programs can help foster equitable and nondiscriminatory environments, promote independence of students with disabilities, and help students learn to recognize and report instances of abuse. Both courts and the federal government have used the presence or lack of SEL programs as an indicator of whether schools are fulfilling their obligations to protect students’ rights. For this reason, SEL programs can help schools avoid legal liability, even as they help students grow in important ways

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-59, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;James Lane, CEO of PDK International, talks with Kareem Farah, the CEO and co-founder of the Modern Classrooms Project, which offers free training for teachers who want to transform their teaching to adapt to student needs. Farah describes the competency-based model of teaching advocated in the Modern Classrooms Project, what a classroom using the model looks like, how it aligns with pacing guides and standards, what outcomes he’s seen in schools using the approach, and how educators can learn more.

        <title>Backtalk: Partnering with families to close pandemic learning gaps</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;National Assessment of Educational Progress results show that U.S. students have not recovered the from the learning losses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys also show that parents and families are not aware of the extent of the crisis. Anna King, immediate past president of the National PTA, discusses the importance of letting parents know the extent of the problem and sharing how they can help.

        <title>Career Confidential: Teacher is lonely at work</title>

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this Kappan column, Phyllis L. Fagell gives workplace advice to a teacher who longs for a sense of belonging with the other adults in the building. Fagell also weighs in on whether a staff development specialist should serve as a “go-between” for teachers and administrators.

        <title>Avoid evidence-based practices and the What Works Clearinghouse — unless…</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-48, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Educators who are urged to use evidence-based practices to improve instruction often end up disappointed at the results, which fall short of those touted in the research and by the What Works Clearinghouse. Stanley Pogrow explains how common strategies researchers use to demonstrate evidence of success, such as statistical significance of or effect size, can make results seem more dramatic than they are. Such measures are more valuable to researchers than to educators who are looking for interventions that will make a difference in their classrooms or schools. Pogrow offers recommendations for both educators and the research community for improving the state of education research.

        <title>Teachers coping in the classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 14-19, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Just like their students, teachers face mental health struggles in their classrooms. Many of them must learn to cope with teacher-facing trauma while balancing students’ needs and commitment to teaching, which is emotionally exhausting. Authors Christine E. Hood, Ilana Horn, Katherine Schneeberger McGugan, Karen Underwood, Jessica Smith, and Brette Garner write about a case of a teacher whose well-being was negatively affected by trauma as well as a lack of institutional support available to help her cope or process with that trauma.

        <title>Needed: More school psychologists</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-23, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) estimates that the U.S. needs approximately 63,000 more school psychologists to meet the recommended ratio of one student per 500 school psychologists. This would ensure every student has access to comprehensive school psychological services. Unfortunately, while students are facing a mental health crisis after the pandemic, the school psychologist shortage is getting worse. NASP’s Seth Lipkin writes about the urgent need for more school psychologists and outlines several potential solutions at the local, state, and federal levels that could help.

        <title>Gifted education advances school integration and equity</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-54, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Gifted and talented services have a long and tainted history. Since their inception, they have not served a student population that mirrored the racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic diversity of the nation as a whole. But this need not be the case. Contemporary approaches to gifted education can advance the goals of equity and school integration. In short, they can be a means through which schools serve a more diverse student population. This is possible by mandating access to gifted services in all schools, making sure all students are universally screened for eligibility, and using within-building comparisons to determine eligibility. Scott J. Peters, Matthew C. Makel, and James S. Carter III outline this perspective and explain why it would be effective at mitigating school segregation and popular among a broad range of constituencies.

        <title>Reframing trauma-informed practices</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-13, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Discussions of trauma-informed practices tend to focus on student behaviors and strategies for managing those behaviors, rather than the circumstances students are experiencing. Critical educators have expressed concern that a focus on trauma-informed practices lead teachers to view students from marginalized backgrounds with a deficit lens, assuming that they all have experienced trauma. Travis Wright suggests reframing trauma as messiness, which conveys that children’s lives are complex, that they are placed in difficult situations, and that the challenges are ongoing. Describing children’s lives as messy, instead of traumatic, enables educators to take a more expansive view of children’s experiences and potential trauma responses. Emotionally responsive teaching responds to the messiness of students’ lives by promoting healing relationships among students, teachers, and families that foster resilience and restoration.

        <title>The rural teacher shortage</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 36-41, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;There is much alarm about the current teacher shortage resulting from the pandemic and its aftermath. But teacher shortages have long been a perennial issue in K-12 education. Researchers Richard Ingersoll and Henry Tran analyzed data from the National Center of Education Statistics to compare rural schools to urban and suburban schools to understand their teacher staffing problems. They found that rural teacher shortages are worse than elsewhere and are driven by teacher turnover and hence won’t be solved just by focusing on new teacher recruitment. High-poverty rural schools and rural schools with high levels of students of color face the most extreme teacher turnover of all schools, experiencing departures of between a quarter and a third of teachers annually. Their reasons for leaving include lack of classroom autonomy and the inability to be included in schoolwide decision making.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 4-4, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tell a story of worsening mental health across the board, with students from marginalized groups experiencing the greatest risk. The November 2023 issue of Kappan looks at how schools can address student and teacher mental health. In her Editor’s Note for the issue, Teresa Preston discusses some of the highlights of the issue.

        <title>Tackling negative thinking in the classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 24-29, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Anxiety has been on the rise since the pandemic, yet teachers are often unsure how to help students with anxiety. Anxiety is characterized by rumination and negative or distracting thoughts, and teachers can help by changing those inaccurate thoughts. In this updated version of a November 2019 Kappan article, Jessica Minahan provides a series of practical strategies for helping students recognize their inaccurate negative thoughts and replace them with more accurate thoughts. For instance, teachers might help students see that only one part of a daunting task is actually difficult or that experiences students previously dreaded turned out to not be so bad. Over time, with the daily support of their teachers, students can learn to think more accurately, allowing them to develop anxiety-reducing strategies and fully engage in the classroom.

        <title>Helping students be ‘happier and less worried’: A conversation with Elizabeth Englander</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 30-35, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Bullying has been a well-recognized problem for schoolchildren for many years, but the attitudes and potential solutions to bullying have evolved. Once it was believed that schools and adults should not intervene in bullying among children, but now we know that educators can and should create a safe climate for all their students. Attitudes about students’ mental health have changed, too, especially since so many children were impacted by school closures, family upheaval, and social isolation during the pandemic. Educators can play a role in improving their students’ mental health. Bullying and cyberbullying researcher Elizabeth Englander talks to Kappan magazine about the mental health impact of bullying and cyberbullying on students as well as ways teachers can stem bullying behaviors in the classroom. She also discusses the potential long-term impact of the pandemic on students’ mental health.

This infographic shows how the data breaks down by race, political party, and community type.

        <title>The experience of youth-participatory action research in a social innovation lab: A methodological and organizational approach</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Based on the theory and quality criteria of Youth-Participatory Action Research (Y-PAR), youth and adult co-researchers at a social innovation lab in Ontario, Canada, have undertaken various knowledge generation and action activities for the purpose of supporting youth mental health and wellbeing among transitional-age youth (ages 16–25). We describe the methodological and organizational approach employed in this undertaking, including aspects of the social innovation model to support the action components of Y-PAR. We draw on Bradbury-Huang’s (2010) seven choice points for quality in action research to structure this collective reflection. Our experiences illustrate the tensions and opportunities arising from housing a Y-PAR project within a large health services institution. We also note how social innovation lab processes can support the emancipatory aims of participatory research. Implications for using Y-PAR in other areas are included.

        <title>Gender Differences in the Impact of the Informal Economy on the Labor Market: Evidence From Middle Eastern Countries</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although considerable discussion has been devoted to the macro determinants of labor market variables across genders, comparatively little attention has been given to the contribution of the informal economy to this market. This study was aimed at empirically investigating the impact of the size of the shadow or informal economy (IE) on labor market variables across genders in 12 Middle Eastern countries. The study used quarterly time series data on each country under investigation, covering 1991 to 2015. Phillips–Perron unit root tests were carried out to verify the stationarity of the examined economic series. An autoregressive distributed lag approach was adopted to conduct cointegration tests and estimate long-run regression coefficients and error correction terms. The results indicated that the IE served men and women differently across countries. Whereas this economy had a long-run positive relationship with men’s employment rates in Bahrain, Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, this relationship existed among women only in Israel. IE activities matter in the employment of men and women in Middle Eastern countries. The sizes of IEs in the labor market are a significant factor that favors men’s employment rather than that of women.

        <title>Seeking Direct Accountability for Disproportionate Discipline and Dis/ability Classification</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Accountability for racially disproportionate discipline and dis/ability classification has conventionally spotlighted the disparate impact on students. Typically, findings such as “x% of African American students were suspended” or “y% of Latinx students were misidentified as having learning dis/abilities” reinforce this pattern. Our qualitative study sought the outlines of a different framing that locates accountability in practices, policies, and patterns of adult actors that produce those unjust outcomes. Practitioners, policy makers, researchers, and activists participated in this interview study by giving their perspectives on that reframing. Although their analyses fell short of directly holding the educational system accountable, they did highlight reforms such as increasing student agency in discipline and classification processes, expanding those processes to include a holistic analysis of students’ lives, and acknowledging that current accountability measures evade and obscure structural racism in discipline and dis/ability classification.
