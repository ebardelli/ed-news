        <title>“Rise Up, Hand in Hand”: Early Childhood Teachers Writing a Liberatory Literacy Pedagogy</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although writing is often used for personal reflection in teacher education, it is less commonly leveraged to imagine educational futures (Gilligan, 2020)—particularly those centered on collective liberation. Amid intersecting social crises, however, imagining futures is critically important (Ladson-Billings, 2021), and writing is a crucial step toward bringing them into the present. In this participatory case study (Reilly, 2010), we explored the future-oriented writing practices of five early childhood teachers in an inquiry group. Drawing on critical literacy (Vasquez et al., 2019) and prolepsis (Cole, 1993), we describe how collaborative, creative, and pedagogical writing supported them in envisioning, enacting, and leading liberatory literacy pedagogies within and beyond their schools. Findings contribute to literature in teacher education, early childhood education, and literacy.

        <title>Impacts of Tax and Flavor Tobacco Policies on San Francisco Bay Area Tobacco Prices</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Background: California Proposition 56 increased the state tobacco tax by $2 per cigarette pack effective April 1, 2017. Between 2015-2020 San Francisco (SF) and some cities in Alameda County enacted local flavored tobacco sales restrictions. SF also increased its Cigarette Litter Abatement Fee, from $0.20/pack in 2015 to $1.00 in 2020.Objectives: Compare the change in tobacco prices before (2015) and after (2019/20) the implementation of a $2 increase in tobacco excise tax and local flavored tobacco policies in SF and Alameda Counties.Research Design: Descriptive study of the pre-to-post policy analysis design. We drew a proportional random sample of retailers (N=463) in SF and Alameda Counties, by city. Using multivariable, single- and multiple-level linear regressions, we compared inflation-adjusted average tobacco prices in 2015 vs. 2019/20 by county and by flavor policy, accounting for socio-demographics.Measures: Change in inflation-adjusted average tobacco prices in 2015 vs. 2019/20 by county and flavor policy, accounting for socio-demographics.Results: Between 2015-2019/20, the increase in cigarette prices was higher than the $2 tax increase, and higher in SF than Alameda County (+$4.6 vs +$2.5). SF retailers stopped selling Newport menthol cigarettes and Blu brand menthol e-cigarettes in 2019/20. Adjusted average cigarette prices increased significantly more in SF and Alameda County cities with comprehensive or partial flavor policies versus cities without flavor policies (by $3.23 and $2.11).Conclusions: Local flavor policies affected menthol product availability and may have had positive spillover effects and indirectly increased pack prices.

        <title>White Christian Nationalism: What Is It, and Why Does It Matter for Educational Research?</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The ascendance of White Christian nationalism has profound implications for democracy and public institutions in the United States, including public education. This article explains the core beliefs and features of White Christian nationalism as a contemporary religiopolitical movement that seeks to fuse Christianity with civic life; delineates how and why it matters for educational research; and identifies how education scholars might begin to address White Christian nationalism, particularly by investigating how it can be unlearned. We argue that learning about White Christian nationalism can help educational stakeholders better understand current educational battles, such as banning books and discussion of critical race theory, and contextualize a wide range of pressing problems facing US education, especially problems involving educational justice and equity.

        <title>How Did Colleges Disburse Emergency Aid During COVID-19? An Implementation Analysis of the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;To address the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress authorized the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF I) in March 2020 with over $6 billion allocated for emergency financial aid. In this paper, we utilize the administrative burden framework to analyze HEERF I implementation for a stratified random sample of colleges, focusing on the implications for equity. We find that disbursement policies varied along two dimensions: (1) whether they imposed burdens on students by requiring applications and proof of hardship and (2) whether they targeted needy students and varied the amount of aid according to need. When we examine sectoral differences, we find that private for-profit colleges were more likely to place higher burden on students, whereas public and minority-serving institutions were more likely to reduce burden.

        <title>The Relation Between Need for Cognition and Academic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Need for cognition is conceptualized as an individual’s intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. Over the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in how need for cognition impacts and correlates with learning performance. This meta-analysis summarized 136 independent effect sizes (N = 53,258) for the association between need for cognition and academic achievement and investigated the moderating effects of variables related to research context, methodology, and instrumentation. The overall effect size weighted by inverse variance and using a random effects model was found to be small, r = .20, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from .18 to .22. The association between need for cognition and learning performance was moderated by grade level, geographic region, exposure to intervention, and outcome measurement tool. The implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

        <title>A Meta-Analysis and Quality Review of Mathematics Interventions Conducted in Informal Learning Environments with Caregivers and Children</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The purposes of this study included conducting a meta-analysis and reviewing the study reporting quality of math interventions implemented in informal learning environments (e.g., the home) by children’s caregivers. This meta-analysis included 25 preschool to third-grade math interventions with 83 effect sizes that yielded a statistically significant summary effect (g = 0.26, 95% CI [0.07, 0.45) on children’s math achievement. Significant moderators of the treatment effect included the intensity of caregiver training and type of outcome measure. There were larger average effects for interventions with caregiver training that included follow-up support and for outcomes that were comprehensive early numeracy measures. Studies met 58.0% of reporting quality indicators, and analyses revealed that quality of reporting has improved in recent years. The results of this study offer several recommendations for researchers and practitioners, particularly given the growing evidence base of math interventions conducted in informal learning environments.

        <title>Lost in Translation in the Study of Mentoring 17 Years Later</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this article I describe and reflect on my evolving undestandings of the study of mentoring since the publication of the 2005 article in the Journal of Teacher Education. My reflective journey suggests stressing two assertions to the study of mentoring. One, that there is a need to develop a more multidimensional and integrated conception of mentoring which draws on integrated models of mentoring and focuses on mentor-mentee/s dyadic and collaborative interactions as units of analyis and interpretation. Two, that we should go deeper into how mentors’ sense-making of being ‘lost or found in translation’ as agents of change operates within complex fields of interaction, at multiple policy, personal and interpersonal levels. Thus. a curriculum for learning to mentor should also include contents related to policy learning. I elaborate on these undestandings throughout the paper.

        <title>Portraying Teacher Education for Inclusion: An Analysis of the Institutional Discourse of Dual Certification Programs</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Dual certification programs are proliferating as the principal means of preparing teachers for inclusive practice. Drawing on the 1,408 university-based teacher education programs on the 2019 Title II database, we examined the institutional website discourse for every program offering prospective teachers the opportunity to earn a general and special education license. One-quarter of these websites reflected discourse conveying inclusion as a reform, transformational, and equity strategy for teaching; three-quarters limited discourse to the practical benefit of earning two licenses, absent any elaboration regarding inclusive teaching. This raises questions regarding whether these programs serve a robust reform function in orienting prospective teachers to inclusive practice or instead a transactional function that maintains the traditional binary relationship between general and special education.

        <title>Unfolding algebraic thinking from a cognitive perspective</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract
      &lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Little is known about the cognitive effort associated with algebraic activity in the elementary and middle school grades. However, this investigation is significant for sensitizing teachers and researchers to the mental demands of algebra learning. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between algebraic thinking and domain-general cognitive abilities. The sample of the study comprised 591 students from grades 4 to 7. The students’ abilities in algebraic thinking were assessed through a test that involved three task categories: generalized arithmetic, functional thinking, and modelling languages. Test batteries were used to assess students’ domain-general cognitive abilities in terms of analogical, serial, spatial, and deductive reasoning. The results of structural equation modelling analysis indicated that (a) analogical reasoning predicts students’ abilities only in generalized arithmetic; (b) serial reasoning predicts students’ abilities only in generalized arithmetic; (c) spatial reasoning predicts students’ abilities in functional thinking and modelling languages; and (d) deductive reasoning predicts students’ abilities in all three categories. Differences between students across grades are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conceptual and procedural teaching: does one teaching approach moderate the relationship between the other teaching approach and algebra achievement?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In mathematics education, researchers often contrast conceptual and procedural teaching approaches, although labels and conceptualizations often vary across studies. Prior research has extensively examined empirical relationships between the two teaching approaches and mathematics achievement. In our study, we aimed to extend this research by exploring whether one teaching approach moderates the relationship between the other teaching approach and algebra achievement. Specifically, we investigated whether the relationship between one teaching approach and algebra achievement differs depending on the degree to which the other teaching approach is implemented. We used data from the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:2009) that was conducted in the USA. In our study, procedural teaching was measured as the amount of emphasis that teachers placed on objectives related to procedures and computational skills, whereas conceptual teaching was measured as the amount of emphasis that teachers placed on objectives related to understanding, application, and motivation. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to analyze the data, thus accounting for clustering of students within classes and classes within teachers. We found a statistically non-significant interaction effect. This result suggests that the association between one teaching approach and algebra achievement is similar across the degrees of the other teaching approach. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant association between conceptual teaching and algebra achievement. Specifically, conceptual teaching was positively related to algebra achievement. For procedural teaching, we found a statistically non-significant association. Hence, we did not find evidence that procedural teaching is related to algebra achievement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Principal Beliefs Predict Responses to Individual Students’ Misbehavior</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;National policies have targeted widespread exclusionary discipline in schools which is associated with negative academic outcomes. Principals play an important role in making disciplinary decisions, yet little is understood about how their mindsets might impact these decisions. We hypothesized that principals’ mindsets regarding the purpose of discipline (exclusion vs. prevention) would predict their responses to misbehavior. In a random, nationwide sample (N = 234), principals responded to misbehavior by a hypothetical Black or White student. Exclusion beliefs predicted more severe discipline, whereas prevention beliefs predicted greater endorsement of referring the student to a school counselor. Principal mindsets also predicted exclusionary discipline in real-world contexts.

        <title>The role of movement in young children’s spatial experiences: a review of early childhood mathematics education research</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Young children’s spatial reasoning is critical to mathematics learning from an early age. Recent reviews have drawn attention to the importance of mathematical experiences in the early years; however, an explicit focus on research in spatial reasoning can contribute to a more coherent account of the field. This paper reports a scoping review of qualitative studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 37) during the years 2009–2021. The studies analysed in this review provide insight into children’s embodied spatial concepts and non-verbal expressions such as gesture and the relationship between spatial reasoning and mathematics learning in early childhood (birth to 8 years). Four main themes were found: (i) children’s manipulation and transformation of objects, (ii) children’s bodily engagement with and within spaces, (iii) children’s representation and interpretation of spatial experiences, and (iv) contexts for spatial learning. While the review illuminates a deeper awareness and a more holistic and embodied view of children’s spatial competencies, there remains few studies focussed on children under three years of age. Future directions for ongoing research are identified.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“Find the area enclosed by...” Parceling an especially robust model of reasoning among first-year students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics education research has been aware that calculus students can draw on single definite integrals as a model to compute areas (SImA), without minding whether the function changes its sign in the assigned interval. In this study, I take conceptual and empirical steps to understand this phenomenon in more depth. Building on Fischbein’s theory, I conceptualize area as a figural concept and associate its calculation with intra-mathematical modelling routes that pass through the network of figures and integrals. To characterize these routes, I analyzed video clips that students in a large first-year service course in mathematics submitted as part of their coursework. This led to the construction of an analytical cycle explicating the models that students generated when implementing SImA. To appreciate how widespread SImA can be, I use the responses of nearly twelve thousand students in final multiple-choice exams in the same course over a decade. This analysis found that nearly thirty percent of the students chose answers that are consistent with this model of reasoning; in some exams the SImA-options were selected more frequently than the correct answers. Drawing on these findings, I make several teaching-oriented comments about the relations between areas and definite integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Investigative Research Projects for Students in Science: The State of the Field and a Research Agenda</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;One of the ways in which students can be taught science is by doing science, the intention being to help students understand the nature, processes, and methods of science. Investigative research projects may be used in an attempt to reflect some aspects of science more authentically than other teaching and learning approaches, such as confirmatory practical activities and teacher demonstrations. In this article, we are interested in the affordances of investigative research projects where students, either individually or collaboratively, undertake original research. We provide a critical rather than a systematic review of the field. We begin by examining the literature on the aims of science education, and how science is taught in schools, before specifically turning to investigative research projects. We examine how such projects are typically undertaken before reviewing their aims and, in more detail, the consequences for students of undertaking such projects. We conclude that we need social science research studies that make explicit the possible benefits of investigative research projects in science. Such studies should have adequate control groups that look at the long-term consequences of such projects not only by collecting delayed data from participants, but by following them longitudinally to see whether such projects make any difference to participants’ subsequent education and career destinations. We also conclude that there is too often a tendency for investigative research projects for students in science to ignore the reasons why scientists work in particular areas and to assume that once a written report of the research has been authored, the work is done. We therefore, while being positive about the potential for investigative research projects, make specific recommendations as to how greater authenticity might result from students undertaking such projects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The earlySTEM Program: An Evaluation Through Teacher Perceptions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conceptually grounded curricular materials in the context of professional development programs facilitate teachers’ adoption of new pedagogies. Even though science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional development opportunities for early grade level teachers continue to receive attention, one existing challenge is to support teachers further in implementing well-defined integrated STEM curricula. The earlySTEM program supports K–4 teachers with the systematically developed earlySTEM curriculum, its associated curricular materials, and year-long mentoring. The program was implemented in 26 schools. This mid-evaluation investigated teacher perceptions of the earlySTEM program with a focus on contributions and challenges. A total of 134 teachers from the 26 schools responded to a survey with open-ended questions. Survey data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. The findings indicated that the teachers had positive experiences with the earlySTEM program. The results revealed that the earlySTEM program is perceived to have contributed to (a) teachers’ STEM teaching skills and STEM conceptualizations and (b) students’ skills development and awareness on the connection of the curriculum content to real-world problems. The results also document the perceived challenge in implementing the earlySTEM curriculum: need for more classroom time. The conclusions offer insights for similar program designs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Expansion of Title V: A Historical Analysis of the Promoting Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the development of major educational policies is essential, especially federal policies integral to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs)—one of the fastest-growing types of postsecondary institutions in the United States, which collectively serve over two-thirds of Latina/o/x-identified college students. Accordingly, in this archive-based study, we explore the expansion of Title V, specifically the creation of the Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program, and how advocates framed the need for this program. Specifically, employing McBeth et al.’s policy narrative framework, we story how Congress came to enact this program, describing the setting, characters, and plot of this policy process. In doing so, we make visible via narration how federal policy unfolds and the relationship between federal and state-level policy. Additionally, we show that nationalist, capitalist, and democratic logics are often used to justify programs to support the Latina/o/x community. Considering the findings, we conclude with implications for policy and future research. Ultimately, using this innovative lens, we expand the HSI literature and complexify the understanding of Title V.

        <title>What Counts as a Minority-Serving Institution? Toward the Utilization of a Standardized and Uniform Definition and Typology</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are unique in their ability to support the educational advancement of students of color. Approximately one in five postsecondary institutions are eligible for funding under an MSI designation, yet more than half of all undergraduate students of color are enrolled in such colleges and universities. However, there continues to be great disagreement and confusion about how to define MSIs. Researchers, policymakers, advocacy organizations, and even institutions themselves have advanced different and inconsistent definitions as to what might be considered an MSI. Given these contrasting constructions of MSIs, the purpose of this article is to offer a uniform definition and typology as to how MSIs should be defined and to construct an MSI dataset based upon this approach. We assert that this approach will yield more accuracy to the description and study of MSIs, which will greatly benefit and inform the work of institutional leaders, advocates, policymakers, and the broader MSI research community.
