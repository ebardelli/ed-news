        <title>Conducting a Community-Level Needs Assessment Through Dynamic Engagement With Stakeholders</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This paper presents the process of conducting a community-wide needs assessment that initially focused on soliciting information about childcare needs of families with school-aged children. The researchers were interested in understanding whether the method designed to conduct the needs assessment helped to foster collaboration, trust, and increased participation amongst multiple levels of stakeholders and subcommunities. Utilizing community-based participatory research principles, the authors will present a 3-phase approach to gaining community support through multiple levels of stakeholder engagement. While initially the needs assessment was focused on childcare, the scope broadened to learning about other needs that families with school-aged children faced. The strategic use of Survey Ambassadors throughout the community who could access families that were typically underrepresented and could provide feedback to the researchers in real time regarding modifications to the process was vital. Lessons learned included the need for further investigation into strategic methods for gaining family voices in underrepresented populations.

        <title>Young philosophers: fifth-grade students animating the concept of space</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In many schools across the world, students experience mathematical concepts as ideas empty of wisdom and possibility. In this paper the authors analyze a philosophical conversation in which fifth-grade students were caught up in the animacy of the concept of space. Challenging the common view of mathematics as dealing with absolute truths and certainty, these students, the materials, and the concept itself formed dynamic assemblages that, through movement and the senses reanimated philosophical considerations regarding the concept of space. Over the course of an hour, students emerged as young philosophers whose ideas about space converged with those of philosophers from diverse fields, including physics, indigenous education, feminist theory, and dance. Using a philosophical analysis, the paper focuses on the vibrancy of a space filled with forces—images, movement, ideas, and materials—that shaped students’ relationships with mathematics and language. Based on this analysis, the paper provides insights for reimagining the teaching and learning of mathematical concepts as philosophical topics that can support a renewed understanding of the relationship between learner, language, and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Incouple numbers and dedómetros: listening for meaning in bilingual children’s mathematical lexical inventions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous research on bilingual mathematics education has proposed that as children “language mathematics” they use multiple sources of meaning. In this paper, we focus on lexical inventions—bilingual children’s made up words that are not formally defined or used but follow the phonology and morphology of a language—as a source of meaning. Consistent with tenets from translanguaging, we recognize lexical inventions as a creative language practice defying idealized language norms. A raciolinguistic theoretical perspective informs our interpretation of children, teachers, and researchers as listening subjects. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mathematical lexical inventions can prompt a translanguaging space where children, teachers, and researchers resist listening subject positions that predispose them to listen for predetermined language practices. Drawing on two lesson transcripts, one from a fourth-grade English-immersion classroom in Colombia and one from a third-grade Spanish-immersion classroom in the United States, we used moment analysis in translanguaging spaces to identify spontaneous and critical moments where lexical inventions prompted mathematical explorations. We argue for adopting listening subject positions as learners of transgressive language practices that are part of interactions between children and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Intersectionality as a lens for linguistic justice in mathematics learning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism, cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we present insights from a scoping review of research in language education and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical research on language in mathematics education that left interplay between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Beyond language: conceptualizing epistemic violence against Black immigrant students in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper provides on-the-ground accounts of epistemic violence against Black immigrant children in mathematics classrooms. From a critical feminist perspective, we introduce Dotson’s notion of silencing as an enactment of epistemic violence. According to Dotson, one way to enact epistemic violence is to damage a particular group’s ability to speak and be heard. A successful act of communication depends on the audience’s willingness and ability to “hear” the speaker. Therefore, denying this reciprocity in communication is a form of epistemic violence. Using this conceptualization, we conducted a secondary data analysis from a larger study aimed at enhancing teachers’ knowledge and abilities to implement problem-solving teaching. We identify and characterize three practices of silencing Black immigrant students in Chilean mathematics classrooms that damage their agency as knowers and doers of mathematics. Beyond language issues, we show that silencing is a form of anti-Black onto-epistemic violence that prevents Black immigrant students from being recognized as legitimate subjects of knowledge in mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Worlds and words: entangling mathematics, language, and context in newcomer classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This work studies mathematics word problems’ use in a classroom of recent immigrants, or newcomers, to a United States public elementary school. I study how word problems foster the recontextualization of mathematical concepts in a lived reality experienced by newcomer students in their new cultural and educational setting. In this study’s setting language plays a significant role in the process of meaning-making. I describe how language use in word problems remains intertwined with mathematics instruction. This opens a space for questioning word problems’ purpose and role in multilingual classrooms, and I highlight how the creative process of co-constructing problems’ meaning in this context can expand notions of genre applied to word problems. Throughout I adopt a theorization of translanguaging as a language practice and apply it in problem discussion. This helps probe how language use impacts students’ ways of understanding and utilizing mathematical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On whose tongue will the goddess write, in whose tongue will the state speak? Mathematics education, Tamil language, and the caste question in India</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics education in India is offered in one of the 22 officially recognized state languages or in English even though there are at least 270 languages with more than 10,000 speakers each. Caste, a deep-rooted structure that stratifies Indian society, is integrally linked to shaping state languages. There is minimal research from India that looks at language and mathematics education and practically none that factors in caste. Focusing on Tamil Nadu, a state with a history of anti-caste movement on the one hand and pure Tamil movement (a movement that sought to create a Tamil language with no words from other languages) on the other, this conceptual paper seeks to explore this dimension. More specifically, by using caste as an analytical framework, and by drawing on examples from the mathematics textbooks published by the Tamil Nadu State Board of Education and the experience of a few teachers and learners, the paper seeks to make a theoretical argument that the use of pure Tamil in mathematics textbooks has negative implication for socio-culturally and economically marginalized students who are solely dependent on textbooks as the only source for learning mathematics. There is a strong need for carrying out empirical work that would highlight the nuances and complexities involved in realizing ‘mother tongue’ education in mathematics, particularly for those who belong to marginalized caste-class backgrounds, and we hope that such work would emerge in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three embodied voices speaking on/to research on language, mathematics, and the learner</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this literature synthesis, the three authors bring their embodied voices to collectively retrace the political-cultural-racialized-gendered topographies where key conceptualizations of language, mathematics, and the learner have emerged. Recognizing that they themselves have never been outside these landscapes as mere objective observers, the authors project their situated voices to critically consider—always with a sense of ownership and responsibility—what the field of language and mathematics research has done with/to these conceptualizations. These critical considerations are intended as a collective reminder that the field of language and mathematics education research can move forward by (re)engaging a dialogue between “what is” and “what could be” In this sense, the purpose of this literature synthesis is not to report yet another state of the art in the field, but rather to pierce through ongoing discourses to re-engage the field in reimagining possibilities for reopening, revising, and reimagining the concepts, methodologies, and philosophies that inform research in language and mathematics education. The synthesis concludes with a discussion of how and why our multivocal literature synthesis matters in the field of mathematics education research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Facing and challenging language ideologies towards a more inclusive understanding of language in mathematics education research—the case of sign languages</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Research on language in mathematics education is largely dominated by a ‘normalcy’ of spoken languages. This modal hegemony does not only affect a whole group of learners in failing to provide access that is epistemologically equitable—those using sign language as their preferred mode for mathematical discourse—it also obscures our view on the roles language can play in mathematical thinking and learning. As a field, we can only win from seeking to understand Deaf learners of mathematics beyond a disability, as learners of mathematics with a specific linguistic background that influences mathematical thinking and learning in peculiar ways. In this contribution, I suggest a shift in mindset towards a more inclusive view on language in mathematics education research and practice. I propose basic principles to inform a perspective for reconsidering the role of language in mathematics thinking and learning, inspired by work of philosopher Francois Jullien. This perspective counters a perspective that merely integrates sign language into existing research and instead searches for dialogue between linguistic modalities in learning mathematics, looking beyond language as spoken or written. This approach will be illustrated by the case of the modal affordance of iconicity foregrounded in signed mathematical discourse, its role in Deaf students’ mathematics thinking and learning, and how this can inform existing research and practice dealing with language in mathematics education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reconnecting with the mathematical thought of the Mesoamerican numbers in Ixil: an onto-epistemological dialogue</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Numbers and languages are present around the world. While mathematics is deemed as universal, communities around the world have developed mathematical practices that align with their specific context and needs. Rooted in an Indigenous epistemological framework, this manuscript presents a dialogue among four co-researchers and teachers retelling their experiences teaching and learning Mesoamerican numbers in both monolingual (Spanish) and bilingual (Ixil and Spanish) contexts. With a strong desire to learn about and reconnect with the forces of Indigenous mathematical thought and language that move within the teaching and learning of these numbers, the authors collectively reflected on their “tellings” of prior work. It is worthy of note that these reflections on teaching and learning processes of naming Mesoamerican numbers, their symbols, and numerical values help realize that these concepts are more fully animated when presented in contexts that are onto-epistemologically relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>When mathematics has spirit: Aki Chike Win</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This paper is an examination of the way mathematics, and STEM, arises through stories of teaching and learning on, with, and alongside &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt;. It emerges from research, undertaken in different Nations (Cree, Dene, Métis, Mi’kmaw, Naskapi, Canada), that considers what locally meaningful K-12 STEM teaching and learning might look like in Indigenous contexts. The paper reflects our research process. Each story is followed by a conversation that surfaces elements of how mathematics, language, learning, and different ways of knowing, being, and doing circulate together and emerge in relation to &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt; and all relations living within it. We frame the work in ethical relationality to open a space where Indigenous and Western knowledges might co-exist, attending to ongoing tensions in the work between ways of knowing, being, and doing of different people and peoples/nations, between perspectives and experiences of indigenous and non-indigenous participants, between languages, while still creating spaces where we might move closer together through iterative processes of collective learning. This exploration provides insight into how and when we might remember that mathematics has spirit, how quantity and pattern live in various contexts, when numbers might be inadequate for a context, and how all these ideas can meaningfully inform mathematics teaching and learning via relationships between language, mathematics and learners. We seek a mathematics that resists abstraction as extraction and instead lives and enspirits teaching and learning through relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Humanizing mathematics education: quantitative and arithmetic argumentation of indigenous cultural practices</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry artifact called &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;püron&lt;/em&gt; (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucanía Region in Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize structures and to establish a numeration system close to the historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people. Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the experience contributes to the students’ linguistic awareness of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mapudungun&lt;/em&gt; (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Policy Solutions: Transgender students: Navigating the politics</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 60-61, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Superintendents increasingly are leaving their positions over pressure and vitriol in their communities over culture war issues, such as critical race theory and supports for LGBTQ+ students. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins performed two studies revealing that when policies on transgender students are framed as protection from violence, more people support those policies, regardless of their political affiliation. These considerations could help districts support transgender students without tension and controversy in their communities.

        <title>Under the law: A case for social and emotional learning</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Social-emotional learning (SEL) has been a staple in U.S. schools for decades, but it’s recently drawn criticism from policy makers and advocates who believe these programs represent government intrusion into areas best reserved for families. Robert Kim describes some of the legal arguments that support the use of SEL in schools. SEL programs can help foster equitable and nondiscriminatory environments, promote independence of students with disabilities, and help students learn to recognize and report instances of abuse. Both courts and the federal government have used the presence or lack of SEL programs as an indicator of whether schools are fulfilling their obligations to protect students’ rights. For this reason, SEL programs can help schools avoid legal liability, even as they help students grow in important ways

        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;National Assessment of Educational Progress results show that U.S. students have not recovered the from the learning losses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys also show that parents and families are not aware of the extent of the crisis. Anna King, immediate past president of the National PTA, discusses the importance of letting parents know the extent of the problem and sharing how they can help.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this Kappan column, Phyllis L. Fagell gives workplace advice to a teacher who longs for a sense of belonging with the other adults in the building. Fagell also weighs in on whether a staff development specialist should serve as a “go-between” for teachers and administrators.

        <title>Avoid evidence-based practices and the What Works Clearinghouse — unless…</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 42-48, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Educators who are urged to use evidence-based practices to improve instruction often end up disappointed at the results, which fall short of those touted in the research and by the What Works Clearinghouse. Stanley Pogrow explains how common strategies researchers use to demonstrate evidence of success, such as statistical significance of or effect size, can make results seem more dramatic than they are. Such measures are more valuable to researchers than to educators who are looking for interventions that will make a difference in their classrooms or schools. Pogrow offers recommendations for both educators and the research community for improving the state of education research.

        <title>Teachers coping in the classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 14-19, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Just like their students, teachers face mental health struggles in their classrooms. Many of them must learn to cope with teacher-facing trauma while balancing students’ needs and commitment to teaching, which is emotionally exhausting. Authors Christine E. Hood, Ilana Horn, Katherine Schneeberger McGugan, Karen Underwood, Jessica Smith, and Brette Garner write about a case of a teacher whose well-being was negatively affected by trauma as well as a lack of institutional support available to help her cope or process with that trauma.

        <title>Needed: More school psychologists</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-23, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) estimates that the U.S. needs approximately 63,000 more school psychologists to meet the recommended ratio of one student per 500 school psychologists. This would ensure every student has access to comprehensive school psychological services. Unfortunately, while students are facing a mental health crisis after the pandemic, the school psychologist shortage is getting worse. NASP’s Seth Lipkin writes about the urgent need for more school psychologists and outlines several potential solutions at the local, state, and federal levels that could help.

        <title>Gifted education advances school integration and equity</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/3&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;, Page 50-54, November 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Gifted and talented services have a long and tainted history. Since their inception, they have not served a student population that mirrored the racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic diversity of the nation as a whole. But this need not be the case. Contemporary approaches to gifted education can advance the goals of equity and school integration. In short, they can be a means through which schools serve a more diverse student population. This is possible by mandating access to gifted services in all schools, making sure all students are universally screened for eligibility, and using within-building comparisons to determine eligibility. Scott J. Peters, Matthew C. Makel, and James S. Carter III outline this perspective and explain why it would be effective at mitigating school segregation and popular among a broad range of constituencies.
