        <title>Robot-Assisted Language Learning: A Meta-Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This meta-analysis included 27 empirical studies to explore the effectiveness of robot-assisted language learning (RALL) as well as the moderating effects of a number of variables. The comparison of 64 effect sizes from 2,637 participants indicated significant variability between the independent samples. The overall results showed that the combined linguistic and affective gain of RALL was significant. The results of moderator analysis showed that most moderators, including place of the study, type of robot, publication type, instructional level of the learners, design of the study, time points of assessment, learning setting, second language (L2) proficiency level, type of assessment, language domain, and the non-RALL condition had no significant effects on learning outcomes. However, the moderating effect of the participants’ age was significant as RALL was found to be more effective for elementary school students (7–12 years old). The findings provide insights into the design of effective robots for second language acquisition (SLA) that support learners with certain characteristics.

        <title>Creating equal groups from n items: mathematical creativity in kindergarten</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study examines the solutions of 34 kindergarten children as they create equal groups from &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; bottle caps, where &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; was equal to 8, 9, 22, and 23. For each &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, children were asked to find as many different solutions as possible. The number of solutions they found, i.e., children’s fluency, as well as the strategies used to create equal groups, was analyzed. Findings indicated that for large numbers, fluency was greater for an even number of objects than for an odd number of objects. In general, most children reached only one solution. For all four tasks, most children created only two equal groups of caps, even though they could have created three groups or more. A significant association was found between tasks and a preferred strategy. While children employed between one and two strategies when working on a single task, when considering all four tasks, they generally employed between two and three strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Validity Evidence for an Observational Fidelity Measure to Inform Scale-Up of Evidence-Based Interventions</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As evidence-based interventions are scaled, fidelity of implementation, and thus effectiveness, often wanes. Validated fidelity measures can improve researchers’ ability to attribute outcomes to the intervention and help practitioners feel more confident in implementing the intervention as intended. We aim to provide a model for the validation of fidelity observation protocols to guide future research studying evidence-based interventions scaled-up under real-world conditions. We describe a process to build evidence of validity for items within the Session Review Form, an observational tool measuring fidelity to interactive drug prevention programs such as the Botvin LifeSkills Training program. Following Kane’s (2006) assumptions framework requiring that validity evidence be built across four areas (scoring, generalizability, extrapolation, and decision), confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized two-factor structure measuring quality of delivery (seven items assessing how well the material is implemented) and participant responsiveness (three items evaluating how well the intervention is received), and measurement invariance tests suggested the structure held across grade level and schools serving different student populations. These findings provide some evidence supporting the extrapolation assumption, though additional research is warranted since a more complete overall depiction of the validity argument is needed to evaluate fidelity measures.

        <title>Equity Intersections: Teachers’ Experiences with Student Wellness Support During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Teachers often address student wellness concerns such as health and mental health. Yet, this work goes largely unacknowledged and unsupported by professional preparation. COVID-19 intensified these concerns amid disrupted systems of student support and increased student distress. Our national survey (N = 1398) pursued the powerful opportunity present during the pandemic to understand the extent and distribution of demands on teachers to address student wellness and the support they receive for such work. We found that the demand for teachers’ wellness work was inequitably distributed across teachers, varying largely by their schools’ sociodemographic characteristics. Additionally, access to support for this work did not align with demand levels. We discuss these findings’ implications for teacher preparation, support, and workload equity.

        <title>Teachers’ professional development for inclusion of experimental mathematics and interactive resources in the classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Information technology enhances the nature of mathematics as an empirical discipline, leading to an approach called “experimental mathematics” (EM). It fosters the use of technology-based interactive resources (IRs) in mathematics education, giving mathematics an experimental dimension and reflecting a tension between the empirical-inductive nature of IRs and formal mathematics (FM). Our qualitative research focused on professional development (PD) for IR-based teaching of EM intertwined with FM based on a threefold theoretical framework that combines the mathematical knowledge required by EM, the pedagogical functionality of IRs, and instrumental orchestration. The research analyzed 14 high school teachers’ documents generated in the course of a PD program, revealing the evolution of their orientation. We argue that teachers’ evolving orientation toward IR-based EM inclusion in school mathematics is the result of meticulous dynamic PD design implementing three key aspects framed by the threefold theoretical framework: teachers playing various roles during the PD, teacher-researcher collaboration, and theoretical support. The beginning of the evolution of the teachers’ orientation toward IR-based EM inclusion in school mathematics was made possible by a design grounded in the above theoretical framework and observed through its lens.&lt;/p&gt;
