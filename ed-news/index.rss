        <title>Do New Forms of Reading Pay Off? A Meta-Analysis on the Relationship Between Leisure Digital Reading Habits and Text Comprehension</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Previous research has evidenced a strong positive relationship between leisure print reading habits and reading comprehension across the lifespan. The rapid evolution of new forms of leisure digital reading could modify such a relationship. This meta-analysis extends previous research by analyzing the relationship between leisure digital reading habits and reading comprehension. We analyzed 40 effect sizes using multilevel analysis. Data involved 469,564 participants from studies published between 2000 and 2022. The average effect size reflects a small significant effect on reading comprehension (r = .055), which contrasts with the medium size effects found in the literature related to print reading habits and comprehension. This relationship is significantly moderated by the reader’s educational stage. At early stages (primary and middle school) negative relationships are observed between leisure digital reading and text comprehension, while at later stages (high school and university) the relationship turns positive. We highlight the different contributions that reading modalities and technological contexts have on our reading comprehension, especially across the lifespan. In sum, leisure digital reading does not seem to pay off in terms of reading comprehension, at least, as much as traditional print reading does.

        <title>Evaluating Program Enhancement Strategies for Remedial Tutoring: A Cluster-Randomized Control Trial With Syrian Refugee Students in Lebanon</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Despite widespread enthusiasm for remedial education programming with refugee populations, there is little rigorous evidence on how to design and implement such programs. We employ a cluster-randomized design of non-equivalent treatment groups to test the impact of access to two types of program enhancement: longer program duration and the addition of skill-targeted social and emotional learning (SEL) activities for Syrian refugees enrolled in Lebanese public schools. We find that, compared to 10 weeks of programming, 26 weeks marginally increases students’ literacy skills (ES = 0.04) and significantly improves behavioral regulation (ES = 0.31), but students reported less positive perceptions of their public school environment (ES= −0.83 to −0.89) and remedial tutoring site (ES= −0.15 to −0.24). We also find that the addition of skill-targeted SEL activities to 26 weeks of programming results in higher student reports of school-related stress compared to programming without skill-targeted activities (ES = 0.21). Implications for program and policy are discussed.

        <title>Development of Prospective Elementary Teachers´ Beliefs About Mathematics During Their First Semester at University, and the Impact of Inquiry-Based Tasks</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important aim of teacher education in mathematics, especially for prospective elementary teachers, is to develop desirable beliefs about mathematics that positively affect teachers’ professional practice. Thus, we subdivide our study into two parts. First, we examine whether, and how, beliefs of prospective elementary teachers develop in their first semester. In this part, we consider beliefs as relatively stable constructs (Liljedahl et al., in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Nordic Studies in Education&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;17&lt;/em&gt;(3–4), 101-118 &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r23&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/span&gt;) and examine whether the first semester stimulus is strong enough to change these beliefs. Second, we examine a teaching approach based on inquiry-based tasks for first-semester prospective elementary teachers. The tasks encourage prospective elementary teachers to actively engage in mathematics by exploring basic mathematical structures, relations, and patterns. To assess the two parts, we conducted a pre-post-test study. We collected data at two universities with different teaching approaches (inquiry-based teaching approach and classic teaching approach). We administered a questionnaire both at the beginning and at the end of the semester to measure the beliefs changes of prospective elementary teachers. The study is considered a natural experiment because students were not randomly selected. Comparability for university-specific data sets was achieved through the procedure of propensity score matching. The results suggest that the first semester of prospective elementary teachers contributes to changes in their beliefs about the nature of mathematics. In addition, the data provide evidence that inquiry-based teaching approaches may contribute to the desirable development of certain beliefs of prospective elementary teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ensuring Educational Continuity in the Midst of Crisis: Policy and Planning During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As the COVID-19 crisis disrupted schooling, recovery efforts in California included the adoption of Senate Bill (SB) 98, which mandated local educational agencies to complete Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans (LCPs). These plans act as critical snapshots of sensemaking and local policy implementation during crisis; however, their details have yet to be explored statewide. Through a multiphase, mixed methods approach, this study examines the legislative requirements of a state-level policy that orchestrated large-scale local planning. Results reveal that SB-98 recombined prior educational routines to fit the pandemic context. Moreover, district plans generally adhered to policy guidance and described a range of resources to support students. However, the limited details contained in most plans—particularly about the actions and services for students that may need additional supports—proffer suggestive evidence of local capacity and will during the global pandemic and the implications for those seeking to implement similar policy measures.

        <title>How Free Market Logic Fails in Schooling—And What It Means for the Role of Government</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Market-based policies, especially school vouchers, are expanding rapidly and shifting students out of traditional public schools. This article broadens, deepens, and updates prior critiques of the free market logic in five ways. First, although prior articles have pointed to some of the conditions necessary for efficient market functioning, I provide a more comprehensive list. Second, with an up-to-date literature review, I show that all of these conditions fail to hold to an unusual extent in schooling relative to other markets. Third, because of these failures, I argue that the most potent critique of the free market approach to schooling comes from the intellectual home of markets—economics. Fourth, I show that the issues leading to inefficiency are the same ones leading to inequity. Fifth, I argue that the analysis points to specific roles for government that go well beyond those included in new universal school voucher policies but are also narrower than the roles of government encompassed in traditional public education. For these reasons, the current policy direction is off track and apparently inconsistent with the main criteria on which we evaluate education policy and even with the values that voucher advocates profess.

        <title>Core Requirements, Structured Flexibility, and Local Judgment: Balancing Adherence and Adaptation in the Design and Implementation of District-Wide Professional Development</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Professional development (PD) for teachers is a ubiquitous feature of the American educational landscape. Yet we know little about how districts navigate the variation in teacher learning needs when designing and implementing district-wide PD programs. In this paper, we describe how the District of Columbia Public Schools implemented an ambitious PD program called LEAP (LEarning together to Advance our Practice). Aligned with best practices, LEAP consisted of weekly group learning in content-specific teams, followed by individualized coaching support, all guided by a district-provided professional learning curriculum. We capitalize on both quantitative and qualitative data to understand how the program was implemented and how the district’s implementation efforts shaped what happened on the ground. Finally, we highlight implications for other districts interested in implementing complex PD.

        <title>The Effects of Race to the Top on Teacher Qualifications, Work Environments, and Job Attitudes</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We estimate the effects of Race to the Top (RTTT) on teacher qualifications, work environments, and job attitudes. Drawing on the Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Teacher and Principal Survey, we create a nationally representative data set of public school teachers from 1988 to 2018. We adopt an event study difference-in-differences research design to estimate the dynamic effect of RTTT on several teacher outcomes. We find evidence that, following RTTT, teachers were more worried about job security relative to prereform years. We find smaller and less consistent evidence of a relationship between RTTT and decreased teacher certification levels and increased levels of cooperation with colleagues.

        <title>Teaching Engineering Design-Based Integrated STEM in Rural Contexts: Nurturing Future Designers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is a notable shift towards prioritizing the teaching of engineering design within K-12 education, coupled with a strong recommendation for engineering design-based integrated STEM education. This approach underscores the sharing of science and engineering practices as a means to facilitate the learning of various STEM disciplines. Nonetheless, the implementation of integrated STEM education in rural schools poses challenges due to constrained resources and a shortage of high-quality programs. To present a tangible instance of design-based integrated STEM education within a rural setting, this study presents a model lesson that showcases the integration of interdisciplinary problem-solving skills within a genuine real-world context. This study examined how teacher collaboration for engineering and science shared practices influenced students’ design process. Concurrent Think-Aloud (CTA) protocol data and design sketches produced by the student design teams during the protocol sessions display how they elicited their design thinking skills and STEM domain knowledge acquired from the integrated STEM lesson in an engineering design task. This study found that the students learned the model lesson through the fully integrated instruction between students and teachers utilized more balanced design cognitions than the silo approach of integration. The findings highlight that the utilization of engineering design in K-12 education to cultivate integrated problem-solving skills should be accompanied by domain-integrated instructions for effective implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hockey Card Statistics: By the Numbers</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;On the lookout for and with a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters, this article is dedicated to hockey cards. More specifically, the statistics found on the back of hockey cards. The combination of taking a trip down memory lane, thrifting in British Columbia, traipsing around Toronto, and having coffee (one cream) at Tim Hortons resulted in an investigation as to whether or not hockey card statistics have changed over the last half century. Long story short, they have not. The addition of power play goals and the plus/minus statistic are the only major developments. Although this can be considered an improvement, I consider it a shame. First, the statistics do not reflect changes to the game of hockey. Second, they do not include any of the plethora of statistics readily available at National Hockey League Stats (dot com) and Records (dot com). In other words, I contend that the standard statistics (Games Played, Goals, Assists, Points, Plus/Minus, Penalty in Minutes and Power Play Goals), found on the back of every type of hockey card, do not well enough paint a statistical picture of the hockey player photographed on the front of the card. To cement my contention, I detail my Build-a-Card exercise (akin to Build-a-Bear, yes), which is where one uses a blank back of the card as a canvas with which to paint a proper statistical portrait of a hockey player, albeit beer league hockey style.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Conceptions of teaching and justice as pivotal to mathematics teacher educators’ thinking about mathematical knowledge for teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent scholarship has explored mathematical demands faced by mathematics teacher educators and ways to support their development, but little attention has been given to the basic question of how mathematics teacher educators think about content knowledge for teaching. Knowing what they think could inform efforts to support them. Our analysis reveals that some think about mathematical knowledge for teaching as an independent, abstracted resource to be taught and learned in relative isolation from teaching, while others think about it as dynamic, situated work. We argue that this key difference matters for how they work with teachers. Further, our analysis reveals that their thinking about both teaching and justice interacts with their thinking about mathematical knowledge for teaching and that their thinking in these other two domains can be a resource for supporting their mathematical development.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Bayesian Analysis of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Intervention for High-Risk People on Probation</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This analysis employs a Bayesian framework to estimate the impact of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention on the recidivism of high-risk people under community supervision. The study relies on the reanalysis of experimental datal using a Bayesian logistic regression model. In doing so, new estimates of programmatic impact were produced using weakly informative Cauchy priors and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. The Bayesian analysis indicated that CBT reduced the prevalence of new charges for total, non-violent, property, and drug crimes. However, the effectiveness of the CBT program varied meaningfully depending on the participant&#39;s age. The probability of the successful reduction of drug offenses was high only for younger individuals (&amp;lt;26 years old), while there was an impact on property offenses only for older individuals (&amp;gt;26 years old). In general, the probability of the successful reduction of new charges was higher for the older group of people on probation. Generally, this study demonstrates that Bayesian analysis can complement the more commonplace Null Hypothesis Significance Test (NHST) analysis in experimental research by providing practically useful probability information. Additionally, the specific findings of the reestimation support the principles of risk-needs responsivity and risk-stratified community supervision and align with related findings, though important differences emerge. In this case, the Bayesian estimations suggest that the effect of the intervention may vary for different types of crime depending on the age of the participants. This is informative for the development of evidence-based correctional policy and effective community supervision programming.

        <title>Children’s subtraction by addition strategy use and their subtraction-related conceptual knowledge</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study is the first to examine the associations between the occurrence, frequency, and adaptivity of children’s subtraction by addition strategy use (SBA; e.g., 712 − 346 = ?; 346 + 54 = 400, 400 + 300 = 700, 700 + 12 = 712, and 54 + 300 + 12 = 366) and their underlying conceptual knowledge. Specifically, we focused on two rarely studied components of conceptual knowledge: children’s knowledge of the addition/subtraction complement principle (i.e., if &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;, then &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; − &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; − &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) and their knowledge of different conceptual subtraction models (i.e., understanding that subtraction can be conceived not only as “taking away” but also as “determining the difference”). SBA occurrence was examined using a variability on demand task, in which children had to use multiple strategies to solve a subtraction. SBA frequency and strategy adaptivity were investigated with a task in which children could freely choose between SBA and direct subtraction (e.g., 712 − 346 = ?; 712 − 300 = 412, 412 − 40 = 372, and 372 − 6 = 366) to solve 15 subtractions. We measured both children’s knowledge of the addition/subtraction complement principle, and whether they understood subtraction also as “determining the difference.” SBA occurrence and frequency were not related to conceptual knowledge. However, strategy adaptivity was related to children’s knowledge of the addition/subtraction complement principle. Our findings highlight the importance of attention to conceptual knowledge when teaching multi-digit subtraction and expand the literature about the relation between procedural and conceptual knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tinkering to Solve Problems That Emerge During Digital Fabrication: Introduction of a New Problem-Solving Model</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The digital age in which we live requires students to be able to solve problems in technology-rich learning environments; however, this skill needs to be better developed in traditional schools. With the growing popularity of Makerspaces in Canadian schools, young people can develop problem-solving skills while working on digital fabrication projects. Nevertheless, how students solve problems in these environments remains to be seen. While many problem-solving models exist, there is an absence of problem-solving models that address how students solve problems that emerge during digital fabrication. Through two of our previous studies on Makerspaces of five New Brunswick schools, we observed the problem-solving process, which brought forth tinkering as an essential phase of the problem-solving process. The purpose of this article is to clarify how students solve problems that emerge during digital fabrication in schools by using data from our previous studies to create a new problem-solving model that highlights the importance of tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching Summative Assessment: A Curriculum Analysis of Pre-Service Language Teacher Education in Sweden and Finland</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this study is to investigate the curricular manifestation of summative assessment literacy in language pre-service teacher education at three universities in Sweden and Finland through multiple case studies. Data sources included program guidelines, course curricula, and study guides. A thematic approach was used to analyze the data based on a theoretical framework involving conceptual understandings, skills, and dispositions in summative assessment. The results indicate that all programs emphasize the basic assessment concepts such as validity and alignment and using assessment to inform teaching and learning. However, compared with formative assessment, summative assessment receives less attention in the curriculum. There are differences in addressing summative assessment through stand-alone and embedded courses and in the literacy areas covered. Implications for teacher education to address summative aspects of assessment in line with teachers’ tasks in schools are offered.

        <title>Is Dis-Ability a Foregone Conclusion? Research and Policy Solutions to Disproportionality</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Research on disproportionate representation in special education has potential to influence policy in ways that rectify educational inequities. In this study, we investigated how disproportionality researchers have operationalized dis-ability, identified key themes and theories used in disproportionality research, and evaluated the coherence between this research and related policy. We found that studies using medical/rehabilitative frameworks to define disability tended to offer policy recommendations focused on preventing inappropriate identification and enhancing access to early interventions. In contrast, studies situated in social models of dis-ability tended to offer policy recommendations for holistic improvement of educational systems. Finally, disproportionality studies applying legal frameworks tended to advocate for explicit policies regarding race and racism without attending to ableism. Given that federal policy continues to operate from a deficit perspective regarding student variability, we contend that deficit-oriented recommendations for change are unlikely to improve students’ experiences in schools and related outcomes. We discuss the need for disproportionality research to inform policy through frameshifting.
