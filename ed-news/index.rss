        <title>On whose tongue will the goddess write, in whose tongue will the state speak? Mathematics education, Tamil language, and the caste question in India</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mathematics education in India is offered in one of the 22 officially recognized state languages or in English even though there are at least 270 languages with more than 10,000 speakers each. Caste, a deep-rooted structure that stratifies Indian society, is integrally linked to shaping state languages. There is minimal research from India that looks at language and mathematics education and practically none that factors in caste. Focusing on Tamil Nadu, a state with a history of anti-caste movement on the one hand and pure Tamil movement (a movement that sought to create a Tamil language with no words from other languages) on the other, this conceptual paper seeks to explore this dimension. More specifically, by using caste as an analytical framework, and by drawing on examples from the mathematics textbooks published by the Tamil Nadu State Board of Education and the experience of a few teachers and learners, the paper seeks to make a theoretical argument that the use of pure Tamil in mathematics textbooks has negative implication for socio-culturally and economically marginalized students who are solely dependent on textbooks as the only source for learning mathematics. There is a strong need for carrying out empirical work that would highlight the nuances and complexities involved in realizing ‘mother tongue’ education in mathematics, particularly for those who belong to marginalized caste-class backgrounds, and we hope that such work would emerge in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers’ Self-Censorship of Children’s Literature in Texas—What’s Legislation Got to Do With It?</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Although children’s literature has been challenged and banned for decades, some U.S. states have recently enacted legislation limiting how teachers can address such topics as race, sex, and gender in classrooms, which may influence teachers’ selection of literature. To understand this phenomenon, this exploratory concurrent mixed-methods study involved a written children’s literature course artifact and survey responses analyzed through critical literacy and self-censorship frameworks. Findings indicate that preservice teachers reported avoiding conversations about gender and gender identity more often than those about sexual orientation or race. Further, despite legislative changes, participants mostly reported self-censoring due to lack of pedagogical knowledge, lack of policy knowledge, and fear of institutional sanctions, which are long-standing reasons for self-censorship rather than new ones. Comparatively, they self-reported little desire to promote the dominant political ideology. This research indicates that topic-restrictive legislation can influence classroom practice even when teachers do not share the ideology behind such legislation.

        <title>A Multistrategy Cognitive Diagnosis Model Incorporating Item Response Times Based on Strategy Selection Theories</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Response times (RTs) facilitate the quantification of underlying cognitive processes in problem-solving behavior. To provide more comprehensive diagnostic feedback on strategy selection and attribute profiles with multistrategy cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) and utilize additional information for item RTs, this study develops a multistrategy cognitive diagnosis modeling framework combined with RTs. The proposed model integrates individual response accuracy and RT into a unified framework to define strategy selection and make it closer to the individual’s strategy selection process. Simulation studies demonstrated that the proposed model had reasonable parameter recovery and attribute classification accuracy and outperformed the existing multistrategy CDMs and single-strategy CDMs in terms of performance. Empirical results further illustrated the practical application and the advantages of the proposed model.

        <title>Reimagining Preparation For Teachers Of Designated English Learners</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/2&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 19-25, October 2023. &lt;br/&gt;All elementary, secondary, and special education teachers in Massachusetts seeking initial licensure are required to earn a sheltered English immersion (SEI) endorsement. This endorsement is intended to prepare educators to support designated English learners (ELs) in the content areas. However, the course does not reflect current theories of language development or Massachusetts policies about models of second language education. Jennifer Altavilla-Giordano and Emily Blitz explain how they reimagined the course to accomplish three goals: 1) establish a critical stance to SEI instruction, 2) increase the self-efficacy of pre-service teachers, and 3) inspire advocacy on behalf of designated ELs and families.

        <title>The translanguaging school</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/2&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-12, October 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Translanguaging supports emergent bilingual students to draw on languages they bring to the classroom to learn, even as they develop English. This practice also supports schools to develop stronger partnerships with students’ communities. Mina Hernandez Garcia, Mary J. Schleppegrell, Hasna Sobh, and Chauncey Monte-Sano report on a researcher-teacher collaboration that studied translanguaging and how it enabled students to demonstrate their knowledge while engaging in inquiry in social studies. Interviews with the teacher and students and episodes of classroom interaction exemplify how students participated and shared their perspectives. They suggest how schools, teachers, and community members can create a translanguaging school that supports students’ learning and futures as bilingual citizens.

        <title>Accountability for long-term English learners</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/2&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 13-18, October 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The English learner (EL) population has grown by 35% in the last 20 years. However, in addition to new students being identified as ELs, the EL subgroup is being inflated by students who are not being reclassified within a reasonable and developmentally appropriate timeframe. These students, often labeled long term ELs (LTELs), are a product of chronic systemic failures that have barred these students from an equitable education. Leslie Villegas provides an overview of the LTEL phenomenon and offers recommendations for creating a more even picture of the problem.

        <title>Building a bilingual teacher pathway</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/2&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 26-28, October 2023. &lt;br/&gt;New Jersey’s Vineland Public Schools formed a partnership with Rowan University’s College of Education, in Glassboro, New Jersey, to create a dual-enrollment program in teacher education specifically designed for students in the bilingual program. This program provides Spanish-speaking students with coursework in their native language that leads to a teaching degree with a specialization in bilingual education. It has twin goals of offering a pathway to a college degree for multilingual learners (MLs) and producing future bilingual education teachers. Authors JoAnne Negrin, Catherine Michener, and Brooke Hoffman write about the pilot program’s first year and its goals for the future.

Too often, the question of how best to teach English learners has become a political one. Teresa Preston, editor-in-chief of Kappan, shares how some of the articles in the October 2023 issue address the question of how best to educate multilingual students in multilingual schools.

Students in the program also learn about their heritage and culture to stay connected to their families and community. Author Pauline Phi Nguyên Đồng, a Vietnamese language teacher at the high school, suggests that the WHS Vietnamese Language Program is a model for how heritage language programs can be sustained in schools and communities.
