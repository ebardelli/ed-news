        <title>Extending co-operative inquiry beyond the human: Ontopoetic inquiry with rivers</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Co-operative inquiry was conceived as an authentic science of humans as self-determining persons. But what if we extend our definition of persons to include beings in the more-than-human world – and indeed the cosmos itself – as sentient and responsive? This paper gives some account of a series of co-operative inquiries with human and river persons worldwide, drawing on living cosmos panpsychism to address questions of the kind, What would it be like to live in a world of sentient beings rather than inert objects? The paper includes some narratives of encounters with animals who appear at our river encounters, and reflects on the veracity claims we are making.

        <title>Do Trade and Financial Cooperation Improve Environmentally Sustainable Development: A Distinction Between de facto and de jure Globalization</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The adoption of growth strategies based on foreign trade, especially in the previous century when liberal policies began to dominate, is one of the main reasons for the increase in output and indirectly for environmental concerns. On the other hand, there are complex claims about the environmental effects of liberal policies and thus of globalization. This study intends to analyze the effects of global collaborations involving 11 transition economies that have completed the transition process on the environmentally sustainable development of these nations. In this direction, the effects of financial and commercial globalization indices on carbon emissions are investigated. The distinctions of globalization are used to distinguish the consequences of the two types of globalization. In doing so, the de facto and de jure indicator distinctions of globalization are used to differentiate the consequences of two types of globalization. In addition, the effects of real GDP, energy efficiency, and use of renewable energy on environmental pollution are dissected. For the main purpose of the study, the CS-ARDL estimation technique that allows cross-sectional dependency among observed countries is used to separate the short and long-run influences of explanatory variables. In addition, CCE-MG estimator is used for robustness check. According to the empirical findings, the economic growth and increasing energy intensity increases carbon emissions, but the increase in renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality. Furthermore, trade globalization does not have a significant impact on the environment in the context of globalization. On the other hand, the increase in de facto and de jure financial globalization indices results in an increase in carbon emissions, but de jure financial globalization causes more environmental damage. The harmful impact of de jure financial globalization on environmental quality suggests that the decreasing investment restrictions and international investment agreements of transition countries have been implemented in a manner that facilitates the relocation of investments from pollution-intensive industries to these countries.

        <title>Beyond Cultural Mismatch Theories: The Role of Antiblackness in School Discipline and Social Control Practices</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Black students face hyper-disciplining and high levels of social control when they enter American schools. The cultural mismatch hypothesis attempts to explain this hyper-disciplining by arguing that the mostly White teaching force misinterprets the attitudes and behaviors of Black students, which leads to their hyper-disciplining. Utilizing a longitudinal, deeply iterative, participatory, and critical ethnographic research process, however, this article shows that traditional scholarship around the cultural mismatch hypothesis is insufficient. The analysis indicates that teachers’ misinterpretation of mismatched capital (the traditional cultural mismatch hypothesis) is actually a racialized interpretation of both matched and mismatched capital coming from Black students, and such racialized interpretations are guided by the logic of antiblackness endemic to American institutions. Hence, this research argues for the integration of antiblackness as a theoretical tool to expand upon cultural mismatch explanations and for the creation of educational spaces where Black students are recognized, valued, and treated with dignity and humanization.

        <title>Context Variation in U.S. High Schoolers’ Mathematics Orientations</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Educators increasingly recognize the importance of students’ learning orientations, but relatively little is known about how these mindsets vary across and potentially shape educational settings. We use nationally representative data to document contextual variation in mathematics orientations in U.S. high schools. We find systematic variation in orientations between differentiated course levels within school, suggesting orientations are more a feature of proximate instructional contexts than general school climate. Between-course variation in orientations is comparable to analogous sorting on demographic characteristics and not primarily explained by prior achievement. Measures of individual learning orientations at scale hold promise for understanding collective educational contexts.

        <title>“There’s a Lot of Stumbling Forward”: The Impact of Whiteness on Teacher Educators’ Reconceptualization of Culturally Based English Education Curriculum</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Practices incorporating students’ cultures and communities are foundational to effective teaching. However, teacher candidates often do not effectively incorporate culturally based practices into their instruction. This article describes the perceptions of English education instructors as they reconceptualized their curriculum to cultivate culturally based practices. Findings show three major factors impacted the instructors’ reconceptualization of curriculum: (a) the instructors’ cultural roots; (b) the pervasiveness of whiteness—systems and processes that preference white identities, assumptions, and privileges that accompany the white experience; and (c) deep-seated tensions between culturally based practices and the practices of the university operating within the institution of English education. The authors assert that no individual who has matriculated through white-centric educational institutions and broader societal structures can be excluded from the call to unlearn whiteness. They urge teacher educators to dismantle oppressive, white-centric practices by reflecting on the interplay of biases and socio-political beliefs that they and their teacher candidates bring into educational spaces.

        <title>Definitional ambiguity in mathematics: three cases</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Definitions are an integral aspect of mathematics. In particular, they form the backbone of deductive reasoning and facilitate precision in mathematical communication. However, when multiple non-equivalent definitions for the same term exist, their ability to serve these purposes can be called into question. While ambiguity can be productive, the lack of an agreed upon definition can make the truth value of certain mathematical statements unclear. In this study, we presented pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers with three mathematical claims in which definitional ambiguity was a consideration; then, we asked them to determine the correctness of each claim, justify their positions, and anticipate what reasoning might lead to a possible counterargument. Based on their responses, we identified several factors that influenced the participants’ approaches in each situation as well as cross-cutting themes that describe their considerations. Finally, we consider the pedagogical implications of employing such a task in teacher preparation programs and in-service teacher education.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Collective Teacher Efficacy and Its Enabling Conditions: A Proposed Framework for Influencing Collective Efficacy in Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This quantitative study aims to explore the validity of Donohoo et al.’s (2020) Enabling Conditions for Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale (EC-CTES) for fostering collective efficacy in schools and evaluate its relationship to measures of collective teacher efficacy. The instruments used for this study include the EC-CTES, the Collective Efficacy Scale (CES-SF), and the Collective Teacher Beliefs Scale (CTBS). The data were evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis, correlation matrices, and multiple regression models. The findings from this study demonstrate that the EC-CTES is a valid tool. The EC-CTES subscales are positively associated with measures of collective teacher efficacy. We recommend adjustments for the EC-CTES subscales for greater congruence with collective efficacy theory and practical application. Due to the theoretical density of collective teacher efficacy, a modified conceptual framework is proposed to make the enabling conditions theory more accessible to practitioners.

        <title>Mathematics education research on language and on communication including some distinctions: Where are we now?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this article, we present a narrative review of mathematics education research on language and on communication over 2019–2022, but also look ahead by addressing challenges posed by the lack of distinction between language and communication. The persistence and significance of the problem of the distinction between language and communication are thus outlined in a historical moment of celebration of growth of research in the domain. Informed by the analysis of a selection of research journal articles and by our trajectories, we discuss influential topics in the recent discourse: multilingual mathematics classrooms; mathematics teacher education on language in mathematics teaching; multimodal mathematical communication; interaction and mathematics learning; mathematical language and discourse. We connect this with new emerging or old revisited concepts: instructional designing, gesturing, argumenting and languaging. We finish by further reflecting on multimodal mathematical communication and gesturing, and on the potential of expanding the notion of mathematics register towards a notion of mathematics communication register.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>From Collaborative Construction, Through Whole-Class Presentation, to a Posteriori Reflection: Proof Progression in a Topology Classroom</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Coming from a social perspective, we introduce a classroom organizational frame, where students’ proofs progress from collaborative construction in small groups, through whole-class presentation at the board by one of the constructors, to a posteriori reflection. This design is informed by a view on proofs as successive social processes in the mathematics community. To illustrate opportunities for mathematics learning of proof progressions, we present a commognitive analysis of a single proof from a small course in topology. The analysis illuminates the processes through which students’ proof was restructured, developed previously unarticulated elements, and became more formal and elaborate. Within this progression, the provers developed their mathematical discourses and the course teacher seized valuable teachable moments. The findings are discussed in relation to key themes within the social perspective on proof.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teachers Are Not Lemons: An Examination of Spillover Effects When Teachers Transfer Away From Turnaround Schools</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, whole-school reforms will continue to be a prominent strategy for improving student outcomes in low-performing schools. As reform models have proliferated, so has research evaluating the impact in reform schools. However, previous evaluations have rarely examined unintended spillover effects in nonreform schools. With data from Tennessee, this study uses difference-in-differences models to estimate spillover effects from teachers who transfer when their school begins implementing turnaround reforms. Results show that teachers who transfer tend to be less effective than teachers who stay, and they tend to move into nearby schools that are themselves low-performing. However, after transferring, these teachers produce modest positive spillover effects on student test scores in nonreform schools, which is likely explained by improvements in their effectiveness. Moreover, I find that working with more effective peers is a likely mechanism to explain improved teacher effectiveness after they transfer. Overall, this study draws attention to the need for future educational policy evaluations that quantify both intended and unintended spillover effects.

        <title>What is mathematics teaching talk for? A response based on three sites of practice in mathematics education</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;During the last decades, the study of how learners and teachers of mathematics use the resource of language has contributed to our understanding of mathematics teaching and learning in a variety of classrooms and cultures. Developmental work with mathematics teachers on the particular resource of mathematics teaching talk is more recent. In order to explore responses related to the importance of this talk, in this paper we consider three sites of practice in mathematics education—research, professional development and teaching—and illustrations of data from or about them, including studies from the literature, and work with secondary school mathematics teachers in Catalonia-Spain and Malawi around the teaching of angles. We argue that tensions permeate these sites of practice when a focus is placed on word use, specifically the practices of naming and explaining, in mathematics teaching talk. We conclude that the importance of mathematics teaching talk is construed through tensions with other resources in language and teaching. Tensions specifically appear in the realisation of mathematics teaching talk as mediational in the work with mathematics teachers on their classroom teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A dialogue between two theoretical perspectives on languages and resource use in mathematics teaching and learning</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper, we turn to the notion of networking theories with the aim of contrasting two theoretical mathematics education perspectives inspired by Vygotsky’s work, namely, the Theory of Objectification and the Documentational Approach to Didactics. We are interested in comparing/contrasting these theories in accordance with the following three main questions: (a) the role that the theories ascribe to language and resources; (b) the conceptions that the theories bring forward concerning the teacher, and (c) the understandings they offer of the mathematics classroom. In the first part of the paper, some basic concepts of each perspective are presented. The second part includes some episodes from a lesson on the teaching and learning of algebra in a Grade 1 class (6–7-year-old students). The episodes serve as background to carry out, in the third part of the paper, a dialogue between proponents of the theoretical perspectives around the identified main questions. The dialogue shows some theoretical complementarities and differences and reveals, in particular, different conceptions of the teacher and the limits and possibilities that language affords in teaching–learning mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sourcing mathematical meaning as a dialogic process: meaning-focused and language-focused repairs</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;I report the results of an analysis of an episode of elementary school second language mathematics classroom talk focused on the classification of geometric forms, drawing on a dialogic, sources of meaning perspective. The episode was selected 
      because participants make use of a variety of features of language, including vocabulary, gestures and diagrams. The analysis drew on methods and principles from conversation analysis and revealed that interactional repair was a key feature in the organisation of the episode. Repair sequences are stretches of interaction in which participants deal with explicitly signalled ‘trouble’ in participants’ working assumption of shared understanding. The results include a distinction between meaning-focused and language-focused repair, with some repair sequences embedded within others. This layered organisation is important in the emergence of meaning for participants’ utterances and mediates the tension between centripetal and centrifugal language forces. The findings highlight the complexity of mathematics classroom interaction and suggest possibilities for the careful management of focusing on language and on mathematical meaning in classroom interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The use of Arabic language by mathematics teachers as a resource to support teaching</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the research described in this paper, we explored the way Palestinian teachers use the Arabic language to teach mathematics in Arabic. First, we address the issue from an historical overview of the context of study. The historical overview allows us to situate the current context of teaching mathematics in Arabic in Palestine. We rely on Halliday’s concept of register to define what we call “Mathematical Arabic For Teaching”. It allows us to focus our study, and to address the issue of combination between this register to be developed by the teachers and the Arabic textbook content. Our theoretical framework is based on a combination of the theories Documentational Approach to Didactics and Mathematical Discourse in Instruction, which allows us to discuss mathematical Arabic for teaching as a resource. We based our exploratory study on the case of three teachers, chosen according to well-defined criteria. We explored the issue through audio recordings of their lessons teaching tenth graders the signs of quadratic functions, and video recorded interviews on their reflections on those lessons. We identified three combinations between the teachers’ Mathematical Arabic For Teaching and the use of the mathematics textbook, namely, complementarity, tension and equivalence. We conclude with some implications of these forms of combination.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cross-cultural research covering multiple languages and cultures involves negotiating conceptual and linguistic challenges. This paper focuses on how researchers working across cultural and linguistic boundaries navigate the research process and negotiate a common understanding of the constructs under study. Working towards intersubjectivity within a cross-cultural research team is essential, as it deepens understanding of one another’s contexts and our own. We analyze our own research process, as a cross-cultural team studying elementary school teachers’ use of print and digital instructional resources in Finland, Flanders, Sweden, and the U.S. Recorded team conversations served as data to help us explore the way language and culture are intertwined and how these relationships surface when developing research instruments and conducting analysis of the interviews, in which language became a focal point. Challenges emerged particularly within three research aims, namely, naming and describing teaching practices, understanding teachers’ relationships with mathematics resources, and defining digital resources in a cross-cultural survey. Our systematic analysis of instances of conceptual and linguistic inequivalence prompted the team to make language explicit and revealed that these instances varied in several ways that had implications for how and whether they might be bridged. Thus, this paper contributes to understanding the methodological impact of using a shared language, acknowledging that researchers’ lexicons about mathematics teaching are closely linked to their own cultural knowledge and experience. Therefore, working explicitly across language and culture towards mutual understanding is a necessity and a way to reinforce the validity of research outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching the concept of zero in a Malawi primary school: illuminating the language and resource challenge</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this paper we discuss findings of a study that investigated the resources and language that teachers in Malawi use to teach the concept of zero. In Malawi primary schools, textual resources available to teachers are mainly the curriculum materials in the form of syllabus, teacher guides and learner textbooks. The syllabus and teacher guides are in English while the learner textbooks are in Chichewa as teaching is in Chichewa or other local language in the first 4 years of primary school. We used the Mediating Primary Mathematics framework (Venkat and Askew in Educ Stud Math 97:71–92, 2018) and a qualitative case study of two teachers to explore the resources used, how the teachers interacted with the resources and how they moved between the two languages. Our findings include that the language and resources that the teachers used provided affordances as well as constraints for learning the concept of zero. We identified two types of challenges for the teachers; that of naming and that of representing the concept of zero. We discuss what the Malawi context illuminates about teaching zero in post-colonial multilingual settings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Examining the key factors affecting teachers’ translation of a theoretical framework from English into a native language: the Turkish case</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study was aimed at exploring the key factors affecting postgraduate students-teachers’ translation of a theoretical framework from English into their native language. The research was carried out with 21 Turkish postgraduate students who were also mathematics teachers, based on the theoretical framework of the documentational approach to didactics. The research was designed as a case study. The data were obtained from postgraduate students’ weekly translation papers, the recordings of collective translation sessions, and the researchers’ and the postgraduate students’ reflective notes over a period of 7 weeks. The data were analyzed using descriptive and content analysis in order to investigate the factors influencing difficulties the postgraduate students had while translating. The analyses showed that the task of translating a theoretical framework at the postgraduate level led student-teachers to work on the meaning of the concepts and the unity of the framework and to reinterpret the source text. The research showed that the translation of the theoretical framework was strongly influenced by syntactic, sociocultural, and academic/educational differences, and these factors were interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Language as a resource for teachers describing mathematics classroom teaching and learning: a comparative approach</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Describing mathematics classroom teaching and learning is part of a professional expertise. Comparing ‘our distinct stories’ and ‘our professional languages’ about teaching and learning in mathematics classes around the world, reveals cultural and linguistic underpinnings of our ‘stories’ and ‘languages’. Analysing and understanding these ‘stories’ and ‘languages’ in the form of narratives of classroom lessons, is a methodological approach that allows us to study and compare language as a resource across different cultural and linguistic contexts. We based our approach on results of the Lexicon Project, which set out to document the terms and the professional vocabulary that teachers use for describing the phenomena of middle school mathematics classrooms around the world, but enlarged this approach by narratives and a narrative methodology. Our cultural comparative approach based on these narratives revealed not only technical terms that define and make explicit didactical intentions, techniques and approaches, but also offered narrative descriptions of the enactment of the didactic intentions and techniques in situ. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the potential of language and turned out to be valuable for understanding how language orients teachers’ visions and analyses of mathematics classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
