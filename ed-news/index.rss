        <title>Differential Prediction for Disadvantaged Students and Schools: The Role of High School Characteristics</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Validity studies of college admissions tests have found that, on average, students who are Black or Hispanic earn lower freshman grade-point averages (FGPAs) than predicted by these test scores. This differential prediction is used as a measure of bias. These studies, however, conflate student and school characteristics. The differential prediction affecting minoritized groups may arise in part because they attended high schools in which college enrollees, regardless of race, perform worse than predicted. Using data on students who graduated from New York City public high schools in 2011 and enrolled in the City University of New York, we examined this using college admissions and high school test scores. There was no differential prediction based on race/ethnicity among students within high schools when school characteristics were accounted for. Instead, overprediction of FGPA was associated with the school proportion of enrolled Black and Hispanic students. Overprediction was larger in models with high school test scores.

        <title>Towards a Critical Framework of Social Media Literacy: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The role of social media in the global society and economy has increased substantially over the years across different populations, age groups, and contexts. Using social media can be both beneficial and risky. People’s ability to navigate it safely and effectively largely depends on their social media literacy skills, which has significant implications for individuals and society. Drawing on the critical literacy and affordances-in-practice frameworks, we explore the concept of critical social media literacy (CSML) through a systematic literature review to determine whether and how its components—users’ goals, use context, inquiry, reflection, and action—have been addressed in the literature. Twenty out of the 50 publications identified reflected all the components of the CSML framework at different levels. We focused on empirical studies to identify instructional approaches and recommendations to support the development of CSML skills. Implications for research and practice, including curriculum connections, are also discussed.

        <title>Computing Education Interventions to Increase Gender Equity from 2000 to 2020: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Although gender parity has been achieved in some STEM fields, gender disparities persist in computing, one of the fastest-growing and highest-earning career fields. In this systematic literature review, we expand upon academic momentum theory to categorize computing interventions intended to make computing environments more inclusive to girls and women and consider how those characteristics vary by the success of the intervention. Particular attention is given to the efficacy of broadening participation and success for women in computer science, information technology, and related fields. After scrutinizing 168 relevant studies, 48 met the inclusion criteria and were included. We introduce a framework for gender equity in computing, expanding on existing research on academic and STEM momentum to encompass new domains representing social and structural momentum. Our analysis reveals the complex roles of intervention domains, strategies, goals, levels, and duration in shaping their efficacy. Implications for theory, research, and practice are discussed.

            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The 2024 presidential election features a rematch from four years ago: President Biden and former President Trump. While all presidential elections matter, columnist Jonathan E. Collins argues that this election is especially pivotal to K-12 education policy. Collins poses major education policy questions that we should be asking heading into the upcoming election.

        <title>Under The Law: The Israel-Hamas war and U.S. classrooms</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 64-65, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Students’ reactions to the Israel-Hamas war have contributed to conflict in higher education institutions and in K-12 schools. There have been numerous reports of protests, bullying, fights, violence, and anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic rhetoric. Robert Kim discusses the legal boundaries regarding free speech and the obligation to protect students from harassment and discrimination.

        <title>Backtalk: The harm in assessment-backward practices</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The deprofessionalization and mechanization of teaching that comes from teaching to the test and scripted instruction is prevalent in the United States. Teachers now enter their careers in schooling contexts where they are often expected to apply scripted curriculums with high fidelity, sometimes at odds with the pedagogy and methods they learned in teacher education programs. Amanda S. Frasier argues that the shift to assessment-backward design and the focus on controlling actions and micromanaging behavior of teachers is harming the profession and public education.

        <title>Empowering everyday leaders</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 8-13, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Leadership is often conceptualized and taught through famous, world-changing individuals; however, leadership spans levels of influence, from small-group projects to global initiatives. While student leaders are present at every level, existing leadership research and programs center adults. Within this article, Lisa DaVia Rubenstein, Sydney Johnson, Allison Southworth, and Gerardo Ramirez propose the 4L Continuum of Leadership, which recognizes the distinct processes and skills necessary at each level of leadership. With an emphasis on little-l leadership, they integrate specific interpersonal and strategic skill development opportunities into existing curriculum areas. This work empowers all learners to cultivate their leadership potential.

        <title>Possibilities of student voice</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 14-19, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Student voice initiatives like surveys, student councils, and classes focused on leadership and agency all provide youth a way to share their opinions about school-based issues and take action to rectify them to some degree. But the way each initiative is leveraged, the experiences of the young people and educators involved, and the initiatives’ varied goals complicate a singular definition of student voice. Dane Stickney and Julissa Ventura identify levels of student voice to help educators and school leaders in assessing current student-centered approaches and create new, more transformative options that deeply motivate and engage youth.

        <title>Student leadership in family-school partnerships</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-25, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Thomas J. Capretta, Jingyang (Max) Zhang, Eric M. Anderman, and Barbara J. Boone revisit Joyce Epstein’s 1995 Kappan article on overlapping spheres of influence and family-school partnerships. They highlight one idea from the article that has been largely overlooked — the role of student voice and leadership. To refocus researchers’ and practitioners’ attention to the role of students in family and community partnership, they synthesize existing research to elaborate on Epstein’s original models and ideas. They provide three levels of research-based, practical recommendations for districts and schools to elevate student roles and cultivate student leadership in family-school engagement efforts. Finally, they illustrate what these practices look like in schools using an Ohio school district as an example.

        <title>Creating student leaders through civics</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 26-31, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Building on the literature of student leadership development, Natalie Sew, Adrianne Billingham Bock, and Danielle Allen share an approach to civic education: Deeper Civic Learning. This approach offers students the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skills, and key civic dispositions needed to engage in their communities and develop their leadership capacities. This article shares insights from the authors’ work co-designing an 8th-grade civics curriculum with Massachusetts educators. It highlights student perspectives on their experiences with the curriculum through extended stories of the application of civic skills and dispositions in their lives.

        <title>Poll Points: What’s the public perception of teacher shortages?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 72-72, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;The public divides on the severity of teacher shortages: 51% call it either a crisis (16%) or a serious problem but not a crisis (35%). Nearly as many, 47%, call it either not a serious problem (31%) or not a problem at all (16%). Partisanship and ideology are big factors; having a child younger than 18 at home is not.

What are we doing in schools right now to ensure students have these skills? For nearly a decade, a program called Speak Truth has taught students to use their voices, concerns, and capacity to build bridges as tools for understanding different viewpoints and collaborating to lead change.

She successfully petitioned her school district to add a student member to the board of education. In this Kappan interview, she discusses the challenges of serving on the board as a student, how her status as a preferential voter affected her ability make change, and how the National Student Board Member Association (NSBMA) helps to advocate for and provide training to student board members.

        <title>Invigorating principal/assistant principal relationships</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 44-47, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Relationships between and among school administrative team members are critical components of school culture. They serve as a guidepost for the behaviors and attitudes of staff and students. To invigorate these relationships, three embodied practices have high yield not only for the relationships among administrators, but also for fostering a healthy school climate. These practices include intellectual work, communicative collaboration, and inspiration-seeking practices. Sonja Gedde, a high school assistant principal, describes how these practices have been central to the administrative team’s professional relationship with their principal.

        <title>An AI wishlist from school leaders</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 48-51, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;To better understand the current challenges surrounding the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in K-12 schools, a team of researchers (Raffaella Borasi, David E. Miller, Patricia Vaughan-Brogan, Karen DeAngelis, Yu Jung Han, and Sharon Mason) interviewed 36 western New York school leaders in late 2023. Their concerns moved beyond potential cheating, as they instead identified four main priorities: receiving guidance to inform their decisions about AI, empowering all stakeholders to better understand AI and its implications, capitalizing on AI to support the work of teachers and staff, and enabling better technology solutions. These should inform future interventions aiming at leveraging AI in K-12 education.

        <title>Addressing inconsistencies in grading practices</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/8&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 8&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-57, May 2024. &lt;br/&gt;School leaders struggle in their efforts to implement standards-based grading reforms in large part because they fail to address the inconsistency in grading practices among individual teachers. This article describes three crucial steps necessary to gain greater consistency in teachers’ grading practices: (1) Reaching consensus on a purpose statement for grading; (2) using grading scales with four to seven categories of student performance; and (3) reporting multiple grades to describe academic achievement and non-academic aspects of students’ performance separately. These steps provide the necessary foundation for successful implementation of standards-based and competency-based grading reforms.
