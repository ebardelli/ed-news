        <title>Examining the Effects of Renewable Energy and Economic Growth on Carbon Emission in Canada: Evidence from the Nonlinear ARDL Approaches</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Increasing industrial activities trigger the intense use of fossil fuels and increase the number of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Countries with a high share in current carbon emissions need to expand their use of renewable energy sources. Canada is an important energy producer and consumer globally. In this regard, its decisions are important for the future development of global emissions. This study examines the asymmetric effects of economic growth, renewable energy, and non-renewable energy consumption on carbon emissions in Canada from 1965 to 2017. In the first stage of the analysis, unit root testing was performed for the variables. For this, Lee-Strazicich (2003), ADF and PP unit root tests were used. The nonlinear ARDL method was used to analyze the relationship between variables. and Measures: In order to analyze the relationship between the variables in the established model, renewable energy consumption (%), non-renewable energy consumption (%), and carbon emissions (per capita-Mt). In addition, the economic growth (constant price 2010- US$) parameter was added to the model as a control variable. The findings support that energy consumption, economic growth, and renewable energy have an asymmetric effect on carbon emissions in the long run. The positive shock in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, and a unit increase in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions by 1.29%. Besides, the negative shock in economic growth greatly deteriorates the quality of the environment; that is, a 1% reduction in economic growth causes emissions to increase by 0.74% in the long run. On the other hand, positive shocks in energy consumption have a positive and significant effect on carbon emissions. A 1% increase in energy consumption causes 1.69% carbon emissions. There are important policy implications for Canada to eliminate carbon emissions, increase the share of renewable energy sources and achieve its economic growth targets. In addition, Canada needs to reduce its consumption of non-renewable energy (such as gasoline coal, diesel, and natural gas).

        <title>Trends in Parents’ Time Investment at Children’s Schools During a Period of Economic Change</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;This paper examines changes from 1996–2019 in U.S. parents’ time investment at their children’s schools using data from the National Household Education Survey (N ≈ 116,000). The most common way parents spend time at their child’s school is by attending a general school meeting, which rose from 76% to 85% over this period. The proportion who volunteered at school rose slightly over time (36% to 38%), whereas the frequency of participating in school activities decreased slightly. Little change emerged in the proportion who attend a PTA/PTO meeting (~50%), whereas the proportion who spent time fundraising decreased (60% to 54%). Differences in time investment between high- versus low-income parents either narrowed significantly (attended school meetings, frequency of participation) or remained stable (attended PTO/PTA meeting, volunteered) over time, except for income-based differences in time spent fundraising for their child’s school, which grew significantly. We discuss factors possibly related to these narrowing and persistent gaps.

        <title>Preparing Cherokee Language Teachers: Lessons Learned From an Innovative Licensure Program</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Cherokee is an endangered Indigenous language. Revitalization efforts often include offering Cherokee language instruction, but these efforts have been hampered by a lack of qualified teachers. An initial licensure program was launched in fall 2019 aimed at supporting Cherokee language renewal via the preparation of teachers. While a step forward, little is known about this program and the extent to which it meets the needs of Cherokee language teacher candidates. In response, we conducted a year-long case study to chronicle the experiences of a Cherokee language teacher as he completes this program. Results confirmed that teachers of Indigenous languages may still be developing language proficiency and may lack resources, rendering instruction more challenging. Findings also shed light on beneficial program characteristics (e.g., attention to lesson and unit plan design) and emphasized the need for greater involvement of the Indigenous community in teacher preparation programs.

        <title>Beyond Making a Statement: An Intersectional Framing of the Power and Possibilities of Positioning</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this essay, two women of Color researchers examine the intersections of race and disability and ask, “What is the power and purpose of positioning and positionality statements?” Informed by Black feminist theory, and drawing from the DisCrit tenets of intersectional oppressions, historicity, and whiteness and ability as property, the authors focus on researchers’ positioning in relation to how they engage and communicate knowledge about multiply marginalized people. Positionality statements, they argue, must be more than a listing of identities or a claim on authority through the naming of professional proximity to marginalized communities. Recognizing the increasing expectations for education scholars to articulate positionality in their scholarship, the authors offer a three-pronged intersectional framework, with provocations about the onto-epistemic, sociohistoric, and sociocultural elements of positioning. Education researchers interested in conveying how intersectional oppressions effect knowledge production will find this framework useful for crafting positionality statements that consider the multidimensional nature of power, oppression, and research in relation to their field, the literature, and multiply marginalized participants.

        <title>The development of high school students’ statistical literacy across grade level</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The capacity to interrogate data with critical thinking is a strong predictor of statistical literacy (SL). This data interrogation, from the data consumers’ perspective, incorporates four complex response skills: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;communicating&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;evaluating&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;decision-making&lt;/em&gt;, and those skills are strongly supported by students’ appreciation of three interrelated knowledge components (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;text and context&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;representation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;statistical-mathematical knowledge&lt;/em&gt;). Due to the need to be critical data-information readers, students’ SL should develop during their formal schooling. The aim of this paper was to investigate differences in SL between Indonesian year 9 and year 12 students and between female and male students. The same test was administered to 48 year 9 students (50% females) and 48 year 12 students (50% females) from 16 different schools in Indonesia. Findings revealed that the highest percentage of year 9 and 12 students demonstrated evidence of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;consistent but non-critical&lt;/em&gt; thinking (level 4), suggesting that they exhibited their statistical knowledge but not in critical ways. There were 42% of year 9 students showing limited statistical thinking (levels 1 to 3) compared to 17% of year 12 students. Furthermore, while there were no significant gender differences in students’ SL and its all skills, the study shows significant grade level differences in overall SL as well as in its skills except &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;interpreting&lt;/em&gt;. Implications of this study include the development of a framework that provides a coherent assessment of students’ SL from a data consumers’ perspective, along with suggestions for classroom teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Creativity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;of an Aha! Moment and Mathematics Education&lt;/em&gt; presents the implementation of Bisociation and constructivist theory into mathematics learning in school and college. The book has two goals: (1) to look into classroom facilitation, emergence, and depth of knowledge assessment of an Aha! Moment insight, and (2) to look into the connections between Bisociation theory and the fields of creativity and learning theories. This edited volume consists of empirical and conceptual studies comprehensively and in-depth about the creativity of Aha! Moments. This book is the first book that contains the application of Aha! Moments that will certainly encourage readers from mathematics and natural science teachers, human creativity researchers, librarians, and computer experts to dig deeper into the concept and application of creativity Aha! Moments. The volume’s editors hope that readers will have new opportunities to reflect on the critical role of creativity in learning and teaching mathematics at schools.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>“There Was Nothing Here”: School Leaders Using Dual Language Bilingual Education Programs as a Formula to Re-Engineer Student Populations for School Turnaround</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;New York City offers an example of the national trend to expand dual language bilingual education (DLBE) programs, yet only a small proportion of multilingual learners are enrolled in these programs in city schools. Our examination of new DLBE programs in three city schools builds on research about the “gentrification” of DLBE. Specifically, our findings show how school leaders opened DLBE programs to re-engineer the demographics of their student population by enrolling more White, privileged students in the name of “school turnaround”—namely, to increase enrollment and popularity in a school choice context and improve performance on accountability measures.

        <title>An anthropological point of view: exploring the Chinese and Japanese issues of translation about teaching resources</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The aim of this study is to advance understading of teachers’ and researchers’ work, in particular its cultural specificities, from a resource perspective by exploring the issues and challenges faced during the translation of a theoretical framework, the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Documentational Approach to Didactics&lt;/em&gt; (DAD), from Western (English and French) to East Asian languages (Chinese and Japanese). A basic assumption is that the challenges encountered while translating are driven by the cultural and linguistic differences that exist between the West and East. Adopting the perspective of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anthropological Theory of the Didactic&lt;/em&gt; (ATD), we frame the translation work as a transposition process of research praxeology (a model of the researchers’ practices and knowledge) from a Western to an Eastern institution. We investigate this process to identify cultural elements at different levels (school, society, civilization, etc.) using the ATD framework. After translating a DAD article into Chinese and Japanese separately, we then worked collaboratively to identify similar or diverse translation issues and investigated their origins. Consequently, the results revealed a considerable difference between the West and East, and ample similarities between China and Japan, especially in terms of the researchers’ work and its relationship with the teachers’ work.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Compliance, Chaos, or Coherence? How Superintendents, Districts, and Schools Craft Coherence From School Turnaround Policy</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This mixed-method study examines Michigan’s Partnership policy for school turnaround, which positions the district and superintendents as key policy implementation actors. We first interviewed 21 of 35 Partnership superintendents/leaders across Michigan and surveyed teachers to understand the initial response to the turnaround policy and the strategic planning process. We then used our understanding of these leaders’ responses to conduct a purposively sampled embedded multiple comparative case study of three varied districts. These case studies helped us more deeply understand and compare how districts engaged in the process of crafting coherence and school-level stakeholders’ perceptions of activities related to coherence and implementation of the reform. Based on these two levels of data collection and analysis, we found that many leaders used the opportunity to create new changes, roles, and partnerships, but the majority also symbolically adopted policy demands by aligning their turnaround plans with pre-existing efforts. Using cross-case comparisons of our three districts, we argue that some degree of strategic buffering from policy demands may be warranted, especially when districts have low capacity and face significant challenges recruiting and retaining teachers.

        <title>Cheap plot tricks and plot holes in mathematical stories</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Good stories, literary or mathematical, have the ability to keep the reader engaged and wanting for more. However, poorly designed stories may also elicit a negative aesthetic reaction and thereby reduce engagement. By drawing on literary theory and Dietiker’s (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;For the Learning of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; 33(3):14–19, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r10&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Educational Studies in Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; 90(3):285–302, &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r11&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/span&gt;) theoretical framework of mathematical stories, this essay conceptualises two aspects of mathematical stories that are likely to be perceived by the readers as aesthetic deficiencies: mathematical cheap plot tricks and mathematical plot holes. Additionally, examples of them are proposed from various areas of mathematics curriculum and some ideas of how they can be avoided, so as not to hinder engagement, are offered.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evaluating mathematics lessons for cognitive demand: Applying a discursive lens to the process of achieving inter-rater reliability</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this study, we examine “what went wrong” in our professional development program for encouraging cognitively demanding instruction, focusing on the difficulties we encountered in using an observational tool for evaluating this type of instruction and reaching inter-rater reliability. We do so through the lens of a discursive theory of teaching and learning. Data consisted of 10 coders’ coding sheets while learning to apply the Coding Rubric for Video Observations tool on a set of recorded mathematics lessons. We show that some discrepancies between novice coders and experts were found in narratives about valued actions relating to social aspects of teaching, such as teacher explanations and students’ struggle and discussion. These were relatively easy to detect from the written evaluations in the coding sheets. More problematic to pinpoint were places where discrepancies were found between novice and experts’ stories about the mathematical objects discussed. These required re-observing the recorded lessons. The analysis revealed that novice coders referred to objects about which the observed teacher mainly explained calculations, whereas the experts searched for (often, signaling the absence of) mathematical objects that invited exploration. We discuss these findings based on a theory of different Pedagogical Discourses that form the background for expert and novice coders’ interpretations of the coding manual. We conclude with practical implications for the process of achieving inter-rater reliability on observation tools for cognitively demanding instruction.

        <title>Is It Who You Are or Where You Are? Accounting for Compositional Differences in Cross-Site Treatment Effect Variation</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In multisite trials, learning about treatment effect variation across sites is critical for understanding where and for whom a program works. Unadjusted comparisons, however, capture “compositional” differences in the distributions of unit-level features as well as “contextual” differences in site-level features, including possible differences in program implementation. Our goal in this article is to adjust site-level estimates for differences in the distribution of observed unit-level features: If we can reweight (or “transport”) each site to have a common distribution of observed unit-level covariates, the remaining treatment effect variation captures contextual and unobserved compositional differences across sites. This allows us to make apples-to-apples comparisons across sites, parceling out the amount of cross-site effect variation explained by systematic differences in populations served. In this article, we develop a framework for transporting effects using approximate balancing weights, where the weights are chosen to directly optimize unit-level covariate balance between each site and the common target distribution. We first develop our approach for the general setting of transporting the effect of a single-site trial. We then extend our method to multisite trials, assess its performance via simulation, and use it to analyze a series of multisite trials of adult education and vocational training programs. In our application, we find that distributional differences are potentially masking cross-site variation. Our method is available in the balancer R package.

        <title>An Explicit Form With Continuous Attribute Profile of the Partial Mastery DINA Model</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are the statistical framework for cognitive diagnostic assessment in education and psychology. They generally assume that subjects’ latent attributes are dichotomous—mastery or nonmastery, which seems quite deterministic. As an alternative to dichotomous attribute mastery, attention is drawn to the use of a continuous attribute mastery format in recent literature. To obtain subjects’ finer-grained attribute mastery for more precise diagnosis and guidance, an equivalent but more explicit form of the partial-mastery-deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate (DINA) model (termed continuous attribute profile [CAP]-DINA form) is proposed in this article. Its parameters estimation algorithm based on this form using Bayesian techniques with Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is also presented. Two simulation studies are conducted then to explore its parameter recovery and model misspecification, and the results demonstrate that the CAP-DINA form performs robustly with satisfactory efficiency in these two aspects. A real data study of the English test also indicates it has a better model fit than DINA.

        <title>“Protected Teaching Spaces”: Opportunities and Constraints When Teaching for the edTPA</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Preservice teacher performance assessments, such as the edTPA, are one of the accountability policies from states and local authorities designed to ensure the quality of beginning teachers and standardize teacher education. We studied experiences of 65 preservice teachers regarding the effect of the edTPA on their learning in field-placement classrooms. These cases revealed that the edTPA created “protected teaching spaces” for participants to experiment with student-centered instructional practices supported in university courses and codified in edTPA rubrics. This was especially impactful for novices who previously had limited opportunities to try out equitable reform-oriented instruction in their placements. In these cases, the edTPA also helped mitigate inequities in learning to teach, an unintended outcome that is important for policymakers to consider when deciding on credentialing requirements.

        <title>Embodied instrumentation in a dynamic geometry environment: eleven-year-old students’ dragging schemes</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Digital technologies for mathematics education are continuously developing. Still, much remains unknown about how students use these tools and how this affects learning. For example, tablets nowadays come with multi-touch options that allow for a more embodied approach to geometry education, compared to mouse interactions. However, little is known about how students use these opportunities to develop bodily-based conceptualizations of geometric concepts in a touch-based dynamic geometry environment (DGE). The aim of this study was to investigate students’ dragging schemes from an embodied instrumentation perspective and to identify the types of embodied-dragging schemes that the students use, while transforming one type of parallelogram into another. Fifty-seven 11-year-old students worked on a task on transforming a given parallelogram into a rectangle and next into a square, using a tablet-enabled DGE. Results showed that students used three types of embodied dragging schemes: (a) action-perception dragging guided by perceived prototypical images of shapes, (b) sequentially-coordinated dragging based on initial perception and then utilizing the affordances of the artefacts, and (c) adaptive dragging, effectively integrating action-perception loops and geometrical properties. In schemes of types (b) and (c), geometric properties of the constructed shapes emerged and guided students’ action-perception loops. As a conclusion, this description informs teachers, textbook authors, and designers of digital assessment on how to design student activities. From a theoretical perspective, the embodied instrumentation lens provided a fruitful approach to study student–tool interactions in geometry that does justice to the bodily foundations of mathematical cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Secondary mathematics teachers’ descriptions of student engagement</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is a need for a more robust conceptualization of engagement in mathematics education research. Investigating how teachers describe engagement can provide insight into relationships between purposes of engagement and dimensions of engagement. In this exploratory study, we examined how 28 secondary mathematics teachers in two states in the USA talked about their students’ engagement. During interviews, we asked teachers to provide their definitions for engagement, describe their teaching strategies for engaging students, and describe their observations of engagement during a video clip from their own classroom. We interpreted teachers’ talk to identify how they described the nature of mathematics engagement (dimensions such as behavioral, cognitive, affective, and/or social engagement) and purposes of engagement (engagement in learning or in schooling [Harris, 2011]). When teachers described the purpose of engagement as engagement in learning, they also tended to describe the nature of engagement with cognitive and social dimensions and with multiple dimensions of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do mathematicians wish to teach teachers about the discipline of mathematics?</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study investigates what mathematicians, who teach academic mathematics courses to secondary school mathematics teachers, want to teach them about the discipline of mathematics. Data sources included interviews with five research mathematicians. The data analysis revealed that expanding teachers’ knowledge about the discipline of mathematics was one of the interviewees’ main objectives. The mathematicians referred to nine characteristics that can be grouped into three key aspects: (1) essence of mathematics, (2) doing mathematics, and (3) worth of mathematics. The characteristics of the discipline of mathematics generated in our study are in line with ideas and practices widely advocated in the last decades for the teaching and learning of mathematics, and with contemporary philosophical approaches regarding mathematics. The potential of the characteristics to serve as a conceptual framework in studies that focus on teacher knowledge about the discipline of mathematics is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
