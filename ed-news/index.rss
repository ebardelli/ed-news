        <title>‘Led by Intelligence&#39;: A Scoping Review on the Experimental Evaluation of Intelligence-Led Policing</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Intelligence-led policing (ILP) was introduced in the 1990s as a proactive approach to policing, but to date, there is a lack of studies that have synthesized and summarized the central characteristics and insights of (quasi-)experimental studies related to ILP. This study aims to address this gap by synthesizing and characterizing the central characteristics of 38 quasi-experimental and experimental studies related to ILP. In this study, a scoping review is conducted on different quasi-experimental and experimental studies that relate to the framework of ILP. It was found that most studies within the domain of ILP focus on testing the crime reduction effects of using spatio-temporal crime intelligence to deploy police resources more efficiently and effectively. However, some studies have combined different types of crime intelligence or used solely offender-related intelligence. Several statistical-methodological challenges were also identified that should be considered when designing experimental research within the domain of ILP. Additionally, most studies focused solely on measuring crime reduction, with few focusing on secondary effects of interventions. The review concludes that future evaluation studies should consider evaluating the use of different types of crime intelligence and establish specific, objective, and realistic criteria for measuring specific performance measures such as crime disruption. Future experimental research within the domain of ILP should consider applying the 3-i model, evaluating each leg of ILP thoroughly. The limitations of the study are also discussed. This review provides valuable insights for future research and development of ILP-related approaches.

        <title>Teacher noticing in mathematics education: a review of recent developments</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The teacher noticing construct is widely recognized in teacher competence and education research, particularly in the field of mathematics education. This paper surveys recent research on mathematics teacher noticing published between July 2019 and 2022, following an earlier literature review on teacher noticing across different disciplines. The study presented here analyzed 118 English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals, focusing on conceptualizations, research methods, and relationships with other constructs, including teacher knowledge and beliefs. The findings suggest that the cognitive-psychological perspective on noticing, which emphasizes a set of cognitive processes, remains the predominant conceptualization. Recent research on noticing is characterized by a high proportion of studies based on small samples and qualitative research methods. While several studies have demonstrated the interrelatedness of noticing and professional knowledge, the relationship between noticing and beliefs and between noticing and instructional quality has rarely been addressed. Based on these findings, we highlight noteworthy contributions and critical shortcomings, and suggest directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Classroom Concentration of English Learners and Their Reading Growth</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this brief, we use a nationally representative sample of ever-English learners (ELs; N = 783) to examine relations between EL concentration within classrooms and reading growth between kindergarten and Grade 5. Piecewise growth models were used to estimate relations for four developmental periods (K–1, Grades 1–2, Grades 2–3, and Grades 3–5). Results indicate nonsignificant, trivially sized relations for classroom EL concentration across periods, with and without controls for school concentration and student characteristics. Results were robust across multiple specifications. Findings call into doubt the academic benefits of the common practice of grouping ELs together in particular classrooms.

        <title>Exposure to Adversity and Trauma Among Students Who Experience School Discipline: A Scoping Review</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;While the disproportional application of school discipline has garnered notable attention, the relationship between trauma or adversity and school discipline is under examined. The purpose of the current scoping review was to map the state of the literature, empirical and theoretical, at the intersection of school discipline, and trauma or adversity. The findings identified a gap in our knowledge as only 14 of the 49 included articles detailed empirical studies focused on the relationship between adversity and school discipline, with very few from outside of the United States. However, this burgeoning body of knowledge points to a significant relationship between trauma/adversity and experiencing school discipline that warrants further study and contextualizes expanded adversities, including poverty and racism as adversity. We believe this is necessary to acknowledging the hidden and unaddressed trauma among students being disproportionally disciplined, leading to a greater understanding of student lives, and evidence-based, trauma-informed, and culturally attuned discipline.

        <title>The Ties That Bind: An Examination of School-Family Relationships and Middle School Discipline in New York City</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Inequities in exclusionary discipline result from a complex process involving students, families, and school personnel. However, little research has explored the topic from parent perspectives. This study used parent survey data from New York City to investigate the link between school-family relationships and students experiencing exclusionary discipline. Results indicate that stronger parental trust toward teachers is connected to a reduced probability that a student receives an office discipline referral, while greater trust in principals is associated with a lower chance of suspension. Several aspects of school-family relationships, such as parent-principal trust, parental involvement, and school outreach and communication, heterogeneously predict a lower likelihood of experiencing exclusionary discipline by student race and special education status. These findings demonstrate the interdependent role of families and school staff in child development and highlight the need to cultivate positive school-family relationships as a potential strategy for addressing exclusionary discipline disparities.

        <title>Road Safety Efficiency on Interurban Roads in Spain</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The slowdown in economic development caused by traffic accidents in Spain, together with the disparity in the risk of death or injury due to traffic accidents in its provinces, makes it necessary to evaluate their road safety performance. Therefore, the objectives of the present research are, on the one hand, to find out the level of road safety efficiency of Spanish provinces in the period 2014–2018. On the other hand, it is also aimed to determine to what extent the annual efficiency change is originated by pure changes in efficiency or by technological changes. To achieve both objectives, the nonparametric technique of Data Envelopment Analysis and the Malmquist Index have been used based on the consideration of the Safety Performance Indicators (SPI) as the inputs of the process. The research findings show changes in the level of road safety efficiency in each of the years of the study period. Thus, it is possible to identify a geographical delimitation of the causes that generate changes in efficiency in recent years. A contraction in efficiency and technological progress is identified in part of the Spanish provinces in the north, northeast, and south of Spain.

        <title>Promoting statistical thinking in year 12 multilingual classrooms: a collaborative study</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are challenges making connections between language use and mathematics in mathematics education. A lack of connections between the two domains can have negative consequences on student learning and performance. The challenges in statistics classrooms, where language and contexts are important as a medium of instruction, have received little scrutiny. This article reports on collaborative research carried out in three largely Pasifika-dominated year 12 classes. Specifically, we explored the language resources and strategies that appear to enhance the statistical understanding of Pasifika students. Findings from the teacher reflection aspect of the study indicated that some strategies to incorporate student language and communicative resources in their learning worked better than others. Teachers may need to re-evaluate their teaching practices, especially if part of their population is learning English as a second language.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Participatory action research: The woven collective analysis approach to recognize experiential knowledge of poverty</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;When conducting Participatory Action Research (PAR), we risk invalidating the experiential knowledge of people in poverty. Their contributions might only be seen as legitimate when put through a formal PAR process. We have thus developed a “woven collective analysis” approach, intertwining experiential, practical and academic knowledge. Diverse stakeholders reflect together and combine their voices, while ensuring that the experiential knowledge of people living in poverty remains the primary focus. Using the weaving process as a metaphor and a food-autonomy project as an example, we explore the steps involved in this data analysis approach: warping (or the need to recognize different types of knowledge and identify the actions required to use and communicate them); threading (or how to put into place a series of frameworks to allow information on social patterns to emerge, while combining varied knowledge); and sleying (or using targeted collective analysis to tighten up the information, in a recurring and systematic way). These combined operations contribute to the weaving process and the emergence of a new fabric of complex, social and transformational Common knowledge.

        <title>Framing Effects and the Public’s Attitudes Toward Racial Equity in Education Policy</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Frames shape public opinion on policy issues, with implications for policy adoption and agenda-setting. What impact do common issue frames for racial equity in education have on voters’ support for racially equitable education policy? Across survey experiments with two independent representative polls of California voters, framing effects were moderated by voters’ prior policy preferences. Among respondents concerned with tax policy, a frame emphasizing the economic benefits of equity elicited higher priority for racial equity in education. Among respondents concerned with social justice, an “equal opportunity” frame elicited higher priority ratings. However, exploratory analyses showed frames only mattered when respondents held mixed policy preferences. Among respondents who (a) valued both tax policy and social justice issues, or who (b) valued neither, both frames were equally impactful.
