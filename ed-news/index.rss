        <title>The role of an online learning environment in teacher care for secondary mathematics students</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Students’ mathematical learning is bolstered when they have caring relationships with their teachers, yet there is little research on how learning environments may constrain or facilitate teacher care. In this study, I investigate how secondary mathematics teachers understood their care for students online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through analysis of interview and focus group transcripts, I theorize the role of the learning environment in how teachers care for students and their dispositions toward that work. Findings show how an online learning environment both constrained and facilitated teacher care. An obscuration of student thinking online made it difficult for teachers to care for students’ mathematical thinking. The online learning environment contributed to a curtailment of collaborative problem-solving, which in person had supported teacher care for student–student relationships. Teachers described greater privacy with some students online but difficulty getting to know most students. Teachers also reported their care to be conditional on students’ relational initiation or reciprocity. This study highlights the need for professional development for teachers when learning environments shift and future research about learning environments and relational power.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Students’ techniques for approaching defining properties of functions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Functions are an essential concept in mathematics. The studies that have examined functions in advanced contexts have primarily focused on students’ reasoning about specific types of functions (such as binary operations and isomorphisms) but not on the core characteristics of well-definedness and everywhere-definedness. Here, we report on a study in which we conducted task-based clinical interviews to gain insight into students’ techniques for addressing “is the given relation a function?” tasks. We found that the techniques students employed necessarily extended far beyond those reported in the literature (such as the vertical line test) and relied on the previously undocumented notions of sameness, convention, and ambiguity (for well-defined) and notions of containment, existence, and set operations (for everywhere-defined). These techniques coordinated the domain, codomain, and rule, which previous research has highlighted the importance of but stopped short of directly investigating. Two contributions of this work include identifying successful techniques (as the landscape of functions literature predominantly focuses on challenges and difficulties) and identifying techniques for everywhere-definedness (which had not previously received any direct attention in the literature).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The edTPA as a Barrier to Preparing Antiracist Teachers in California</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This paper explores the policy, pedagogy, and practice affordances and constraints of teacher education as an environment to develop pre-service teachers’ antiracism commitments. Through critical analysis of interviews with pre-service teachers and teacher educators at three social justice-oriented teacher preparation programs, research findings indicate that the material consequences of passing the edTPA can lead pre-service teachers to deprioritize the antiracist or equitable frameworks that were emphasized in their program. The edTPA’s inattention to racism and antiracist practice signals an irrelevance to some pre-service teachers. These findings have implications for how teacher educators may approach the edTPA in social justice-oriented programs.

        <title>“Divisive” Education Legislation in the Midwest: A Critical Epistemic Policy Analysis</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This interview-based study examines how justice-oriented K-12 administrators and teachers in Iowa make sense of the recent state-level education policy, H.F. 802. Synthesizing literature on Critical Policy Analysis and epistemic justice, we introduce Critical Epistemic Policy Analysis to understand the micro-level impact of divisive education legislation on efforts to create just and inclusive schools. Findings highlight a sociopolitical terrain with ambivalent and shallow equity commitments, deteriorating support for equity work in schools, and a need to grapple with questions of divisiveness and solidarity in justice-oriented educational activism.

        <title>A Family of Cognitive Diagnosis Models for Continuous Bounded Responses</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Continuous bounded responses in psychometrics usually come from the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a rating scale measurement tool that requires respondents to report their agreement with items by tracing a mark somewhere on a fixed-length continuous horizontal segment with ends that are generally labeled “0% disagreement” to “100% agreement” (or other possible labeling) using continuous data. In recent years, the VAS has gradually appeared in medical, educational, and psychological research, such as research on pain, worry, rumination, anxiety, risk perception, and even personality trait measurement. However, there are very few cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) in cognitive diagnostic assessment that can analyze such continuous bounded data from VAS-type scale. In this study, we propose a family of CDMs for the continuous bounded data in VAS-type scale and provide model selection methods for practice. Three simulation studies were used to examine parameter recovery, the impact of model misspecification on parameter recovery, and the effectiveness of the model selection method. Moreover, real data are used as an illustration to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed models.

        <title>Exploiting Network Information to Disentangle Spillover Effects in a Field Experiment on Teens’ Museum Attendance</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A key element in the education of youths is their sensitization to historical and artistic heritage. We analyze a field experiment conducted in Florence (Italy) to assess how appropriate incentives assigned to high-school classes may induce teens to visit museums in their free time. Noncompliance and spillover effects make the impact evaluation of this clustered encouragement design challenging. We propose to blend principal stratification and causal mediation by defining subpopulations of units according to their compliance behavior and using the information on their friendship networks as mediator. We formally define principal natural direct and indirect effects and principal controlled direct and spillover effects, and use them to disentangle spillovers from other causal channels. We adopt a Bayesian approach for inference.

        <title>Studying the Effectiveness of Team Teaching: A Systematic Review on the Conceptual and Methodological Credibility of Experimental Studies</title>
        <description>
          
            Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The aim of this systematic review is to provide insight into the conceptual and methodological credibility of experimental research designs on the effectiveness of team teaching—a promising instructional strategy wherein two or more professionals collaboratively provide education for a group of students. A total of 31 studies were included. These studies were conceptually and methodologically examined according to two actualized quality-appraisal frameworks. The findings reveal that it remains a challenge to design rigorous experimental studies with clear conceptualizations of key variables related to team teaching. To make convincing claims on the effectiveness of team teaching, there is an urgent need for better-defined quality experimental research. Therefore, we conclude with recommendations for future research, specifically how experimental studies on the effectiveness of team teaching should be conceptually and methodologically implemented to provide policymakers and stakeholders with information for evidence-informed decision-making on educational practices.

        <title>Does Early Elementary Dual Language Instruction Deliver as Promised?</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Utilizing Utah state data, the aim of this study is to examine the association between language program types programs (dual language programs [DLI], sheltered instruction [SEI], and English as a second language [ESL]) since first grade and third-grade basic literacy skills of Spanish-speaking English learners (ELs) in the United States. We employ propensity score matching (PSM) to generate matched samples using child and family factors known to be associated with children’s early literacy: child sex, immigrant status, unhoused status, special education status, child met Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) benchmark at start of first grade, as well as family income and parental language (DLI &amp;amp; ESL, n = 380; DLI &amp;amp; SEI, n = 380; SEI &amp;amp; ESL, n = 550). Regression models comparing early literacy outcomes for each matched group indicate small trends, based on effect sizes, in favor of DLI programs when compared to other program types, although differences were not statistically significant. Implications for policy and practice related bilingual education are addressed.

        <title>Parsing Coaching Practice: A Systematic Framework for Describing Coaching Discourse</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/10&quot;&gt;Volume 10, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Despite the common title of “coach,” definitions of high-quality coaching vary tremendously across models and programs. Yet few studies make comparisons between different models to understand what is most helpful, for whom, and under what circumstances. As a result, practitioners are left with many options and little evidence-based direction. This is exacerbated by the literature’s focus on more abstract features of coaching practice (e.g., building trust), leaving practitioners to figure out what concrete discourse strategies support these goals. This article begins to address these challenges by introducing a taxonomy of coaching “moves,” parsing the concrete details of coach discourse. While the taxonomy is informed by the literature, it highlights conceptual possibilities rather than providing a list of empirically grounded or “evidence-based” strategies. In doing so, this taxonomy may serve as a common language to guide future work exploring how coach discourse shapes teacher development, synthesizing across studies, and supporting coach practice.

        <title>Becoming and Remaining (Un)Critical: A Longitudinal Study of Beginning History Teachers</title>
        <description>
          
            American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In this study, researchers used a longitudinal multisite qualitative cross-case study to examine the beliefs and practices of five beginning teachers related to critical historical inquiry. They collected interview, observation, and classroom artifact data over a 5-year period, from teacher preparation through the teachers’ 4th year in the classroom. Using critical theory as the frame, the researchers found that the beginning history teachers tended to move along two pedagogical continuums: one related to the criticality of content and the other related to didactic- or inquiry- based instruction. Teachers were more successful in engaging in critical historical inquiry practices if they had well-developed conceptual and practice tools and had opportunities to teach within school contexts that supported the use of critical historical inquiry.

        <title>A Framework for Curriculum Literacy in Initial Teacher Preparation: Policy, Practices, and Possibilities</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Across the United States, current curricular reforms are centering high-quality instructional material (HQIM) as a lever for improving classroom instruction and student achievement. While multiple legislative definitions of HQIM attend primarily to the degree of standards alignment, we expand quality to encompass rigor and cultural responsiveness. As teachers make decisions about curriculum materials, they demonstrate curriculum literacy. We conceptualize curriculum literacy as the capacity to navigate teacher identities, learner and community assets, and instructional materials. We survey the literature related to curriculum, curriculum literacy, and teacher education. We then present a framework for curriculum literacy in initial teacher preparation and describe three instructional tools for developing preservice teachers’ curriculum literacy. These tools support teachers’ practices of critically reflecting on their identities in relation to curriculum, contextualizing curricular decisions, and evaluating existing instructional materials. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.

        <title>Assessing the quality of conceptual knowledge through dynamic constructions</title>
        <description>
          
            &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this contribution, we address the gap that has appeared in mathematics education research and practice with the emergence of dynamic geometry environments and build on the opportunities these environments offer to school geometry. In our qualitative empirical study, we investigate how to elaborate on the general model of conceptual knowledge to make it applicable to dynamic geometry tasks, specifically to tasks including dynamic geometric constructions. We present a design of dynamic constructions of quadrilaterals that comply with Euclidean constructions, derive an assessment instrument based on them, and study what information the instrument can provide about the quality of students’ conceptual knowledge. We present the results in the form of an assessment framework consisting of an example of the assessment instrument and an ordered system of qualitative categories serving as an assessment codebook for interpreting students’ responses in terms of the quality of conceptual knowledge. To clarify the relations between the assessment framework and the general model of conceptual knowledge, we establish a system of subdimensions of conceptual knowledge that indicates how conceptual knowledge can be understood in the context of dynamic geometric constructions and identifies the conceptual knowledge needed to achieve individual categories of the assessment framework.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Disrupting Niceness in Literacy Teacher Education: Non-Linear Trajectories Toward Culturally Relevant Pedagogy</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many teacher educators seek to implement culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in their courses. However, enactment is often mediated by our socialization into whiteness and niceness. This study investigates how our self-study community of practice (SSCoP) of eight White female literacy teacher educators at different institutions collaborated to narrow the gap between our aspirations for implementing CRP and enacted practice. Through analysis of collaborative journal entries, we interpret tensions between what niceness and whiteness demand of us and what enactment of CRP requires: (a) between centering equity in our courses and addressing equity on the margins, (b) between enactment of critical pedagogy and maintaining status as “nice” educators, and (c) between the expectation of expertise and the necessity of a learning stance. We argue that teacher educators might use SSCoP spaces to navigate the complex interplay between their identities and the sociopolitical context of teacher education to more fully enact CRP.

        <title>For Such a Time as This: Community Members as Architects of Imagination in Teacher Education Reform</title>
        <description>
          
            Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The narrative woven throughout this article elevates the persistence, perseverance, resilience, and resolve of a neighborhood anchored in faith, and fiercely devoted to its children. Contextualized through its rich history of mobilization for social justice, this story uplifts and defends the cultural wealth of a historically marginalized community as an imperative element of children’s education and as a critical cognizance for those aspiring to become teachers. An exemplar in self-determinism, the narrative, elevates how neighbors’ voice and vision propel innovation in the dynamics of university/community collaboration. Ultimately, the article challenges traditional power structures, offering a compelling and justifiable direction for the field of educator preparation.

        <title>Whose IDEA Is This? An Examination of the Effectiveness of Inclusive Education</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The inclusion of students with disabilities in general education versus more restrictive settings has steadily increased since the 1990s. Yet little is known about inclusion’s effectiveness for these students or their nondisabled peers. I examine the impacts of a district-wide inclusion policy, leveraging the staggered, school-level implementation to estimate the policy’s causal effects on academic and behavioral outcomes. Elementary and middle school test scores and attendance rates were unaffected by the policy. High school graduation and ninth grade promotion rates increased by two and six percentage points, respectively, in the years following implementation. Findings suggest that inclusive education does not come at the expense of students’ academic progress in the short term and may improve academic outcomes in the longer term.

        <title>Mathematics Specialization at High School and Undergraduate Degree Choice: Evidence From England</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This paper examines the relationship between subject specialization in high school and university undergraduate degree program choices. Focusing on a reform in England that encouraged students to opt for studying mathematics in the last 2 years of high school, the study analyzes its effect on undergraduate enrollment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The findings indicate that the reform increased the likelihood of students pursuing and completing STEM undergraduate degrees. Thus, encouraging mathematics specialization during high school enhances the number of STEM graduates. However, despite the reform’s implementation, gender and socioeconomic disparities in STEM participation remained unchanged, suggesting that interventions during adolescence might not effectively address the underrepresentation of specific groups, such as females, in STEM programs.

        <title>Funding Innovation and Risk: A Grey-Based Startup Investment Decision</title>
        <description>
          
            Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;As found in behavioral decision theory, venture capitalists (VCs) rely on heuristics and bias, owing to their bounded rationality, either by limited alternatives or information and resources. India’s booming startup scene challenges VCs in decision-making owing to information overload from numerous evolving ventures, which hinders informed judgment. VC investment behavior, due diligence, and cognitive factors related to decision-making have always drawn the attention of researchers. We provide an alternative approach for an optimal decision by VCs by identifying the attributes that influence investment or funding decisions at an early stage of a venture in tech-based industries. Through a literature review, we identify eight attributes, both on internal and external criteria, that venture investors consider when making investment decisions. Based on interviews with 20 experts, we further identify eight key tech-based sectors. Using grey system theory, we then determine the rankings of eight tech startups for investors’ early-stage investment decisions. This study presents a linguistic variable-based approach of grey numbers to decide weights and ratings, the grey possibility degree to compare and rank different tech startups, and based on the results, suggests the ideal tech startup. We find that agritech ranks first; thus, investors should prefer venturing into such startups for early-stage investment. E-commerce and edutech ranked second and third, respectively, followed by electric vehicle infrastructure, insurtech, fintech, space tech, and software as a service.

            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/2&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 301-328, June 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Multivariate meta-analysis is used to synthesize estimates of multiple quantities (“effect sizes”), such as risk factors or treatment effects, accounting for correlation and typically also heterogeneity. In the most general case, estimation can be intractable if data are sparse (for example, many risk factors but few studies) because the number of model parameters that must be estimated scales quadratically with the number of effect sizes. This article presents a new command, smvmeta, that makes estimation tractable by modeling correlation and heterogeneity in a low-dimensional space via random projection. This reduces the number of model parameters to be linear in the number of effect sizes. smvmeta is demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 23 risk factors for pain after total knee arthroplasty. Validation experiments show that, compared with meta-regression (a reasonable alternative model that could be used when data are sparse), smvmeta can provide substantially more precise estimates (that is, narrower confidence intervals) at little cost in bias.

        <title>Bounding program benefits when participation is misreported: Estimation and inference with Stata</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/2&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 185-212, June 2024. &lt;br/&gt;Instrumental-variables estimation is an approach commonly used to evaluate the effect of a program in case of noncompliance. However, when the binary treatment status is misreported, standard techniques are not sufficient to point identify and consistently estimate the effect of interest. We present a new command, ivbounds, that implements three partial identification strategies developed by Tommasi and Zhang (2024, Journal of Econometrics 238: 105556) to bound the heterogeneous treatment effect when both noncompliance and misreporting of treatment status are present. We illustrate the use of the command by reassessing the benefits of participating in the 401(k) pension plan on savings in the United States.

        <title>Two-step analysis of hierarchical data</title>
        <description>
          
            The Stata Journal, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/stja/24/2&quot;&gt;Volume 24, Issue 2&lt;/a&gt;, Page 213-249, June 2024. &lt;br/&gt;In this article, we describe the package twostep, a bundle of programs to perform analyses of hierarchical data applying the two-step approach. We consider a two-level data setup in which “microlevel” units are nested within “macrolevel” units. One-step models (which can be fit using, for example, mixed) are the most common approach to modeling two-level data. The two-step approach is an alternative in which parameters associated with microlevel and macrolevel predictors are estimated separately for each level. It can be used as an alternative to one-step models if the estimand is a cross-level interaction. We also show how the two-step approach usefully complements one-step approaches by providing exploratory data analysis, descriptive graphs, and regression diagnostics.
