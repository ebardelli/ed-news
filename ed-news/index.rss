        <title>The Role of Minoritized Student Representation in Promoting Achievement and Equity Within College STEM Courses</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In the context of continued equity gaps in student success within and beyond STEM, this paper explored the extent to which the representation of underrepresented racial minority (URM) and first-generation college students predict grades in postsecondary STEM courses. The analyses examined 87,027 grades received by 11,868 STEM-interested students within 8,468 STEM courses at 20 institutions. Cross-classified multilevel models and student fixed effects analyses of these data both support the same conclusion: the proportion of URM and first-generation students within a class is positively associated with STEM grades among all students, and these relationships are stronger among students who are members of the minoritized group. Thus, promoting the representation of students with minoritized identities in STEM courses may lead to greater equity in college outcomes.

        <title>Teacher-Principal Ethnoracial Matching, Geography, and Novice Teacher Career Outcomes</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Nationally, many school districts face a sustainability crisis in teacher workforce, and job retention for novice teachers of color is a key area of focus for educational leaders and policymakers. In this study, we draw on nine years of administrative data from Texas K–12 public schools to better understand how teacher-principal ethnoracial matching is associated with patterns of teacher retention and system-exit. Teacher labor markets are geographically small, so we link data from the National Center for Education Statistics containing geographic locale information to explore how the relationship between ethnoracial matching and novice teacher career outcomes varies across urban, suburban, rural, and town school contexts. We find that matching is associated with an increase in the probability of retention and a decrease in the probability of system-exit, with important variation for novice Black and Latinx teachers working in some nonurban school locales.

        <title>University and democratization: A training project in action research with social movements</title>
        <description>
          
            Action Research, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Current challenges call for a university that assumes a proactive role in the search for a fairer, more egalitarian and democratic world. This study puts action and transformation at the center of academic work, as training students in epistemologies and research methodologies in addition to providing them with new skills allows them to immerse themselves in the social fabric that can accompany the stabilization of community processes. In this text, we present a project within a master’s in community participation and development, in which the students have supported a process of participation by irruption. The internship is a Participatory Action Research project within the framework of a process of consolidating and recognizing a social center occupied by squatters, and it shows two potentials; it means the university students can be trained in a transformational way, and it allows the students to be the protagonists of dynamics which transcend hegemonic academic methodologies and, through teaching and action, support processes of community coordination and the stabilization of democratizing irruption dynamics.

        <title>Family Child Care Program Closure in Alabama During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
        <description>
          
            AERA Open, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/eroa/9&quot;&gt;Volume 9, Issue &lt;/a&gt;, January-December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Family child care (FCC) is uniquely positioned to address challenges with insufficient early care and education supply and access in the United States. FCC programs were steadily declining before COVID-19, and many child care programs, both center- and home-based, were at risk of closure early in the pandemic. This study examines closure among Alabama FCC providers during COVID-19. Specifically, we examine the timing and predictors of FCC providers’ closure using discrete time-hazard modeling. We analyze administrative data for the 788 FCC programs licensed in March 2020. Over the following 28 months, FCC closure risk was closely linked with COVID-19 disease spread trends. Providers who participated in child care subsidy or national accreditation had lower closure risk than those who did not. The protective effects of subsidy participation were amplified in lower-opportunity communities. Results have implications for mitigating FCC decline and identifying resources to support FCC providers’ continued operation.

        <title>The accountability paradigm post-NCLB: Policy Ideas and Moral Narratives</title>
        <description>
          
            Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;For decades, policymakers in the U.S. have leveraged accountability policy as a governing tool to lift school performance and close the achievement gap. Accountability become so widespread that it arguably became a “policy paradigm” with the passage of the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act in 2002. Yet after just 13 years of implementation, policymakers replaced NCLB with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which gave states more control over the policy tools and mechanisms to regulate school improvement. This qualitative project captured the evolution of the accountability paradigm by studying the policy ideas and moral narratives of policy elites in California and Tennessee during the transition period between NCLB and ESSA. The study finds that interview participants legitimized the core design features of ESSA, but attached their underlying worldviews and beliefs to the flexible design features, which created unique accountability models with different institutional arrangements.

        <title>First Person: Make every child the brightest star</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 58-59, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this personal column, Educator Shanshan Wang recounts her experience helping Jack, an 8-year-old student, become more confident in the classroom. Despite myriad academic struggles, including dyslexia, the student’s hands-on abilities and rich imagination showed through in his devotion to crafting the perfect paper airplane. Wang’s experiences with Jack inspired her to create opportunities for all students to share their knowledge and skills with their classmates.

        <title>Reducing harm for the LGBTQ+ community</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 46-51, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Despite progress in recent years, members of the LGBTQ+ community remain underrepresented and underserved in the school system. Ferial Pearson and Steven Gill draw on research literature and their own experiences as out queer educators to recommend a set of actions educators can take to reduce harm to members of these communities in school. They call for explicit safe/brave spaces and school cultures, support for LGBTQ+ educators, greater representation in school curricula, and professional development for teachers. Current research shows the benefits of these approaches, but more research is needed to learn what school-level practices and policy changes will be most beneficial to students in different regions and with different intersecting identities.

        <title>A new North Star</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 52-56, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Leadership gurus often put creating a “shared vision” at the top of their pyramid of what successful leaders do. These visions are best when they are an anchor or a North Star – unwavering goals that the district works toward. Author Jon Saphier proposes this North Star for districts: Make every school an engine for continuous improvement of high-expertise teaching for equity. Saphier writes that the statement conjures concrete images of what to do to improve the experience of children and their learning. It comes with deep anchors in the research base on instructional improvement, deep roots in the literature of healthy organizational culture, and direct ties to the lived experiences of students in school.

        <title>Conflict-competent leadership</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 37-41, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Conflict management is one of the most stressful and frustrating aspects of a school leader’s job. An inability to overcome conflicting viewpoints, ever more palpable in today’s polarized climate, stymies innumerable school reform efforts. Yet, the subject is rarely examined in graduate-level leadership preparation programs or in-service professional development. Robert Feirsen and Seth Weitzman explain that conflict in schools is normal and discuss why knowing how to manage conflict can strengthen leaders and build capacity for school improvement. They offer specific strategies to build conflict resolution skills and embed collaborative problem solving in school culture.

        <title>Designing teacher leadership for school improvement</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 26-30, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;While the demands of teaching continue to escalate, teacher development has changed relatively little over time, leaving many of today’s teachers feeling underprepared, overwhelmed, or demoralized with few opportunities to make real change. Teacher leadership holds promise for both addressing challenges within schools and empowering teachers. Wesley L.C. Henry, Bryan A. VanGronigen, Meredith L. Wronowski, and James L. Olive highlight how a large urban school district in the United States created, resourced, and implemented a program to develop a corps of teacher leaders who used what they were learning to analyze and critique local school improvement plans. They then presented their ideas to administrators and collaborated with their colleagues to implement more responsive improvement efforts.

        <title>Structures for continuous improvement in principal preparation</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 32-36, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;The requisite knowledge and skills of principals are in a constant state of flux. Principal preparation programs need to proactively create systems and structures for continuous improvement and create pathways for information-sharing in order to remain responsive to the needs of local districts. James Coviello, Joan I. Birringer-Haig, and Katherine C. Aquino share how their university has created structures for continual improvement that principal preparation programs can use to in ensure leaders are prepared to face the dynamic tempo of change.

        <title>Equity-centered school leaders</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 20-25, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Ohio’s Columbus City Schools developed a new urban grow-your-own principal pipeline. This pipeline emphasizes the cultivation of equity-centered principals who can address educational and social disparities in transformative and sustainable ways. Drawing from research and professional literature and from district and stakeholder engagements, author James C. Eslinger outlines six interrelated critical dispositions that need to be nurtured within school leaders. He demonstrates how these dispositions are integrated in the recruitment, preparation, and induction of aspiring and novice school leaders in the district. These dispositions are key drivers for leaders’ beliefs and practices to advance equity in schools and beyond.

        <title>Backtalk: Removing artificial barriers to licensure could ease the teacher shortage</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 66-67, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;In this opinion essay, Jori S. Beck argues that current teacher shortages could be mediated by rethinking candidate licensure. She shares various examples of how local, state, and federal policy have prevented talented candidates from earning teacher licensure. She unpacks some of the requirements for licensure, including costs, and discusses actionable steps that could be taken by state and federal government agencies to support teacher licensure.

        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 68-69, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Phyllis L. Fagell offers work-related advice to educators. This month, a teacher wants to know how she can recover after telling an administrator to f**k off.

        <title>Train new principals like THEY work</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 14-19, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Without proper training, the realities of leading a school can overwhelm principals. Specifically, the challenges of leading a school will test principals’ abilities to manage operations and implement effective initiatives. Despite knowledge of these demands, author Craig Hochbein writes that aspiring principals often engage in training experiences that do not align with principals’ work. By focusing on how principals spend their time, aspiring principals, school district administrators, and principal training faculty can improve their contributions to principal training.

        <title>Policy Solutions: Should superintendents be elected?</title>
        <description>
          
            Phi Delta Kappan, &lt;a href=&quot;journals.sagepub.com/toc/pdka/105/4&quot;&gt;Volume 105, Issue 4&lt;/a&gt;, Page 62-63, December 2023. &lt;br/&gt;Research shows that student achievement is higher when the district leadership is stable. Superintendent turnover, especially in urban areas, continues to rise, and many blame education politics for the leadership churn. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins proposes turning the superintendency into an elected position would solve the problem. Elections would give superintendents a guaranteed term of office and they could run as an incumbent on their record.
