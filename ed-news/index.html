          Abstract
                  <p>Despite the prominence of analogies in mathematics, little attention has been given to exploring students’ processes of analogical reasoning, and even less research exists on revealing how students might be empowered to independently and productively reason by analogy to establish new (to them) mathematics. I argue that the lack of a cohesive framework for interpreting students’ approaches to analogical reasoning in mathematics contributes to this issue. To address this, I introduce the Analogical Reasoning in Mathematics (ARM) framework. Constructed from an analysis of interviews with four abstract algebra students, ARM identifies several analogical activities that serve to analyze students’ analogical reasoning with a finer grain size than was previously possible with existing frameworks. Using this framework, I present an analysis of the students’ constructions of a ring-theoretic analogy to subgroup, thus revealing that even constructing simple analogies can elicit diverse pathways of analogical reasoning across students. Implications for further research related to analogies and analogical reasoning in mathematics education are discussed.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Longitudinal processes are often associated with each other over time; therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental processes and understand their joint development. The traditional latent growth curve model (LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the TVC effect on a longitudinal outcome while modeling the outcome’s change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC into initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized as (a) interval-specific slopes, (b) interval-specific changes, or (c) changes from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses, assuming a linear–linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear functions.

          Abstract
                  <p>In recent decades, there has been rapid development in digital technologies for automated assessment. Through enhanced possibilities in terms of algorithms, grading codes, adaptivity, and feedback, they are suitable for formative assessment. There is a need to develop computer-aided assessment (CAA) tasks that target higher-order mathematical skills to ensure a balanced assessment approach beyond basic procedural skills. To address this issue, research suggests the approach of asking students to generate examples. This study focuses on an example-generation task on polynomial function understanding, proposed to 205 first-year engineering students in Sweden and 111 first-year biotechnology students in Italy. Students were encouraged to collaborate in small groups, but individual elements within the tasks required each group member to provide individual answers. Students' responses kept in the CAA system were qualitatively analyzed to understand the effectiveness of the task in extending the students’ example space in diverse educational contexts. The findings indicate a difference in students’ example spaces when performing the task between the two educational contexts. The results suggest key strengths and possible improvements to the task design.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Writing-intensive and proof-based mathematics courses have a variety of unique course outcomes and challenges. As such, active learning in these courses may differ from what we traditionally expect to see in an “active” first-year calculus course: an interactive in-class activity can be replaced with an out-of-class reading and homework problem in a proof-based course. We argue that the latter is no less “active” and claim that reading and writing mathematics form the foundation of how students learn by doing in writing-intensive mathematics courses. In this commentary, we discuss our pedagogical approaches to supporting students’ learning in introductory mathematical writing courses and how we promote active engagement. We outline potential benefits and challenges of these teaching methods and assessment strategies and conclude with some questions for reflection.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Educators are in a time of change, as the emergence, availability, and growth of AI technology challenge long-standing assumptions about the purpose and pedagogies in higher education. In this commentary, I argue that service course designers and instructors have been facing similar dilemmas for over 30 years. I propose that educators can learn from the practices of service course coordinators, and that a service mindset — where we willingly place ourselves in the role of a servant to our students, colleagues, and other stakeholders — is one that we need if we are going to do big things in the face of the challenges ahead. I provide an illustration of the considerations that I made to serve multiple stakeholders as I designed one aspect of a very large, multisection calculus course, and how a service mindset helped to simplify my work.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates the impact of computational labs on students’ conceptual understanding of calculus in a one-semester Business Calculus course. The computational labs integrated Jupyter Notebook as the modeling tool. Using the Calculus Concept Inventory, quantitative analysis was performed to measure differences in conceptual knowledge between a control and experimental group based on whether the student engaged in computational labs compared to traditional classwork. Qualitative analysis was conducted to understand student perspectives about the value of participating in computational labs during the course. The qualitative data involved student reflections at the end of each lab experience. Although the quantitative analysis did not produce statistically significant results, the qualitative analysis revealed the students perceived the computational labs as beneficial regarding their understanding of the content and practical applications of the material. Notably, the students reported the labs offered a unique way to solve problems, allowed for connections to real-life mathematical situations, and helped to visualize calculus concepts. This paper describes the research project and offers practical applications of computational labs in Business Calculus courses, as well as suggestions for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The decisions that teachers make in transforming the curriculum into specific lesson plans determine the real enactment or otherwise of curricular ideals. These decisions are shaped by the resources available and by each teacher’s goals and orientations. This exploratory study employs Schoenfeld’s decision-making model to examine how resources, goals and orientations influence lesson planning for mathematics problem solving, for different profiles of primary teachers in Chile. To this purpose, a survey was conducted among 40 teachers of varying degrees of ability and experience: some were beginning teachers, others were experienced but had no further training in teaching problem solving and a third group was composed of experienced teachers with specific training in this question. Interviews with two teachers from each profile revealed important differences between the three groups. Beginning teachers relied more heavily on official resources such as the official curriculum and standard textbooks, aligning themselves with school requirements. Experienced teachers with problem solving training demonstrated a strong inclination towards teaching through a problem solving approach. While beginning teachers acknowledged the importance of promoting problem solving strategies, they did not usually adapt problems to the mathematical content or to the age/competence of their students. Interestingly, all three groups under-utilised sections of curricular resources that emphasise the present curricular focus on problem solving. Finally, the study found that experience alone is not enough to develop a problem solving approach and that focused professional development programmes are needed to equip teachers with the necessary skills. In addition, a diagnostic teaching approach should be incorporated into initial teacher training.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study contributes to Action, Process, Object, Schema (APOS) theory research by showing two approaches used by advanced mathematics students to construct relations between higher-order derivatives to solve complex problems. We show evidence of students’ ability to perform Actions on their graphing derivative Schema, that is, of its thematization. It also contributes to the literature on the learning of differential calculus by showing how advanced students use their knowledge to construct relations between concepts when facing complex situations. The work of three graduate students on transforming complex graphs and determining their properties and their relation to the domain structure is analyzed to determine their solution approaches. Their graphing derivative Schema is analyzed in depth in terms of the construction of relations among the Schema structures and assimilation and accommodation mechanisms involved in thematization in APOS theory. These findings are important in informing and developing didactic strategies to foster university students’ understanding of derivatives, which can smoothe the transition to the study of advanced mathematics courses.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Rough draft math [RDM] (Jansen, 2020a) occurs when a teacher invites students to share their in-progress thinking and provides opportunities for students to revise their thinking. RDM could be viewed as an approach to ambitious teaching because it is a practice when teachers elicit and respond to students’ thinking to support their learning, which is productive, and their positive identity development, which is powerful. The purpose of this study was to identify salient and feasible enactments of rough draft math, as described by teachers after they have learned about RDM through a book study and/or professional development. We interviewed 32 teachers in eight states in the USA, and we identified variations among the two most feasible and salient enactments of RDM: (1) inviting students to revise and (2) purposeful task selection and implementation. Variations in revising enactments included providing students with structured or unstructured revision opportunities and different ways teachers incorporated revising into their assessment practices (either test corrections or student self-assessment). Variations in task selection included modifying curricular tasks or using instructional routines intentionally. Variations in task implementation included implementing tasks to reinforce content or develop new understandings. We developed conjectures about the ways in which these variations could provide powerful or productive opportunities for students.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This study focuses on the second round of Taiwanese teacher preparation program (TPP) evaluation (2012–2017) to analyze how evaluation policy shapes TPPs. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 stakeholders, which included professors, administrators, researchers, and staff involved in TPP evaluation. First, the findings revealed that neoliberalism influences evaluation policy and restricts the diversity of TPP development. Second, different evaluation approaches may be used to bring more inclusiveness and flexibility to evaluation standards. Third, evaluation plays an important role in TPP development, and a professional organization responsible for evaluation should be established in Taiwan in the future. To conclude, it is significant for TPP evaluation policy to consider policy ideology, evaluation standards, and program diversity to aid in improving the quality of teacher education not only in Taiwan but also internationally.

          Abstract
                  <p>Visualization and argumentation are central processes in the learning of geometry, giving rise to specific lines of research in mathematics education. However, it is worth asking whether they should be developed independently or if it is possible and in what way an articulation between them can be promoted. The objective of this paper is to search for this articulation within the most recent advances in empirical research on the teaching and learning of geometry in Spain. The analysis is approached through the tasks used in research employing two theoretical frameworks which have been developed in Spain, the Onto-Semiotic Approach and Configurational Reasoning. Two main types of task were found in the selected studies: visual tasks and conjecture-and-proof tasks. The results show that in visual tasks the articulation between visualization and argumentation is only necessary in some tasks, in which argumentation aims to justify or to describe the external representation provided as a solution. However, in conjecture-and-proof tasks the articulation between visualization and argumentation must always be present to resolve the task. Analyzing this articulation helps to detect and gain a better understanding of the difficulties that students encounter in solving these types of task. In visual tasks, argumentation helps to understand difficulties associated with the use of visualization. In conjecture-and-proof tasks, visualization determines the argumentation followed, in such a way that many of the difficulties originate more from the visualization than from the process of argumentation.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher education research, by and large, has been profoundly influenced by psychological interpretations of beliefs, particularly the assumption that teachers attempt to reconcile, rationalize, minimize, or avoid contradictions. Building on research across multiple disciplines, which demonstrates that people live harmoniously with contradictions in many situations, we argue that suppositions that people feel compelled to address contradictions have obscured the multitude of inconsistencies that teachers navigate without notice in their everyday lives. Through a multisited, in-depth analysis of a teacher across planning, teaching, debrief and interview contexts, we show that what appears to be contradictory from the perspective of researchers is not necessarily inconsistent for teachers. We explore the theoretical, methodological, and professional learning implications of this shift in interpreting teacher contradictions and inconsistencies.

          Abstract
                  <p>Existing research has highlighted the key role of observation and reflection in teacher learning during lesson study interventions, and how challenging it can be for pre-service teachers. This study focuses on the post-lesson discussion phase and on the observation of the research lesson of a lesson study process. It is carried out with early childhood education pre-service teachers who studied the Theory of Didactical Situations. The aim of our research is two-fold: finding evidence of the activation of pre-service teacher knowledge during the post-lesson discussion, and identifying mechanisms that may explain said activation as well as the potential development of their professional knowledge. To model pre-service teacher knowledge, the notion of teachers’ praxeological equipment from the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, specified in the Theory of Didactical Situations, is used. It is hypothesised that potential teacher learning is mainly connected to the identification of particularly relevant episodes during the observation phase, henceforth referred to as critical events. The analysis of a group discussion on three critical events shows the activation and development of mathematical and didactic components of pre-service teachers’ praxeological equipment. However, it is found that it depends on the degree of dissonance these events can provoke, and on the quality and depth of the discussion that takes place around them. It is therefore concluded that the identification of critical events followed by productive discussion is a mechanism that explains teacher learning through lesson study, which can be enhanced by the intervention of teacher educators as mediators.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The recent spike in book challenges has put school libraries at the center of heated political debates. I investigate the relationship between local politics and school library collections using data on books with controversial content from a sample of 6,631 public school libraries. Libraries in conservative areas have fewer titles with LGBTQ, race/racism, or abortion content and more Christian fiction and discontinued Dr. Seuss books. This is true even though most libraries have at least some controversial content. State laws that restrict curricular content are negatively related to access to some LGBTQ and race/racism titles. Finally, I present short-term evidence that book challenges in the 2021–22 school year are associated with decreases in the acquisition of new LGBTQ materials.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined the impact of ITV intervention on reduction in the propensity to abuse substances and engage in drug trafficking. The researcher conducted this study using an experiment of 517 vulnerable adolescents aged 10–19 years. The participants were randomly assigned to control (n = 258) and treatment (n = 259) groups. The researchers found a significant main effect of treatment conditions on reduction in the propensity to engage in substance abuse and drug trafficking among vulnerable adolescents. That is, before the intervention, there was no significant statistical difference between the control and treatment groups on the propensity to engage in substance abuse and drug trafficking. However, vulnerable children who received the intervention reported a significant reduction in propensity after the intervention. The results highlight the usefulness of ITV as a behaviour change strategy for vulnerable children.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This qualitative, embedded single case study provides a rich description exploring the evolution of preservice teachers’ intention to use and actual use of technology-enabled learning (TEL) during student teaching. The study followed four middle-level education majors at a mid-size public teaching university in the southeastern United States during their student teaching experience (spring 2021). Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) guided this qualitative inquiry. Interviews, observations, and analysis of teaching artifacts (e.g., lesson plans, lesson reflections, and TEL artifacts) were conducted to support data triangulation. In addition to applying theory-based qualitative codes to the data, open coding was conducted to identify themes across the body of evidence. Findings extended previous TPB research regarding preservice teachers’ intention to use TEL in application use cases and yield practical implications for teacher educators seeking to increase TEL intention and use in preservice teacher populations.
