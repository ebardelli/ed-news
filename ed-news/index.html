          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Research on racial disproportionality in special education has exploded, in part due to federal accountability related to over- or under representation of specific racial groups. Some recent research shifts the focus from the role of student characteristics in predicting special education classification to inquire whether school context moderates. We significantly extend this emerging literature using 8 years of elementary student-and school-level data from New York City public schools, examining more school contextual moderators, expanding racial categories, and distinguishing between cross-sectional and over-time differences. We find many more moderators than previous research identified, and these school context factors appear to be particularly salient for the classification of Black students. Results may inform future consideration by federal policymakers regarding assessment of disproportionality.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour to investigate mathematics teachers’ beliefs regarding their intention to collaborate regularly in an online community. The central premise is that initiating such a community necessitates an implementation strategy informed by a better understanding of underlying beliefs influencing teachers’ participation intention. Accordingly, this research examines the intention of Australian mathematics teachers (N = 430) to engage in an online community proposed by their peak state-based professional association. Central to this study, participants’ intentions to engage in regular collaboration predominantly ranged from ‘somewhat disagree’ to ‘agree’, with the average rating approaching ‘somewhat agree’, highlighting the need for targeted strategies to increase this intention. A prominent finding was that participants’ attitudes towards regular collaboration were the strongest predictor of their intention to participate. While participants felt somewhat in control of their collaboration behaviour, this perception did not directly influence their intention; instead, it mediated the influence of subjective approval from others and personal attitudes on their intention. Demographic factors and past online community experiences had far less impact on predicting intentions than the Theory of Planned Behaviour beliefs. Notably, the subjective norm related to perceived approval from others was rated the highest, whereas the norm related to others’ actual behaviour received the lowest ratings, reflecting a significant divergence in the perception of social approval versus actual behaviour. These findings culminate in implications for interventions and extend the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, enhancing knowledge about factors impacting teachers’ engagement in online communities.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Spanish educational curriculum adopts a mathematical process-based approach, which encompasses problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, connections and representation. A fundamental role in the integration of these processes in mathematics teaching is played by teachers’ professional practice of designing tasks. According to this, our aim is to analyze the ways in which pre-service early childhood teachers understand the mathematical processes in the professional practice of designing early algebra tasks and to identify how they intend to promote these processes through the tasks. Content analysis techniques were used to examine the designed tasks. To illustrate the data analysis and results, six tasks are presented. As a result, pre-service early childhood teachers associate problem solving with challenges and questions. They understand problems as unfamiliar situations but ignore the relationships between students and tasks. Moreover, they do not encourage exploration of phases of problem solving and tend to use strategies more suitable for routine tasks. Communication is identified in all the tasks designed, encouraging interaction and discussion. However, only one task explicitly promotes mathematical language. For reasoning and proof, pre-service teachers begin to use questions to elicit explanations and justifications, but do not encourage verification strategies and various modes of reasoning. The process of connections is only present in one task, reflecting the fragmented nature of mathematics teaching. We conclude that the professional practice of designing mathematical tasks is a powerful in teacher education. However, training programs should place greater emphasis on the meaningful use of mathematical processes.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Whole-class mathematical discussion in a problem-solving activity is recognized as a powerful pedagogical activity but also a challenge for teachers who must consider several difficulties that learners might face, particularly in terms of an overload of Working Memory and Executive Functions. This study investigates how the use of a digital platform (Padlet) can support participatory and inclusive mathematical classroom discussion. We proposed a teaching experiment based on graphical tasks anticipating integral calculus to grade 13 students, and we examined how the use of the digital platform plays a role in the construction and interpretation of new mathematical objects emerging from the activity. The use of Instrumental Genesis and Double Instrumental Genesis frameworks allowed us to make the affordances of the tool emerge. As a result, we got evidence of how mathematical discussion may develop as a network of interactions, feedback, and connection of input and discuss examples of how active participation and inclusion are enhanced by the tool affordances. Indeed, the digital platform allowed easy interaction, with many ways to represent and express the ongoing evolution of personal and shared meanings and the possibility to manage the time of the activity. This fostered students’ participation and students which did not participate in previous discussions were actively engaged in it.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>If psychometrics has long concerned itself with validity, reliability, and fairness, then what could psychometrics learn from the cybernetic theories of AI? Through engagement with Burstein’s (2023) Responsible AI Standards, this paper unpacks some paradigmatic differences between psychometrics and cybernetics, points to how recursivity and contingency are both a challenge and opportunity for psychometrics, and how this matters epistemologically, ethically and politically. Following these epistemological differences, the paper raises ethico-political concerns with the promise of the “human-in-the-loop”.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Since its conception by Thistlethwaite and Campbell, a regression discontinuity (RD) design has continuously evolved and progressed in various aspects. This paper explores a novel theoretical advancement in fuzzy RD designs by combining them with multiple control groups under one-sided noncompliance. Within this approach, we estimate the average treatment effect on the treated at the cutoff from the fuzzy RD design and construct its bounds derived from multiple control groups. Using the bounds as a sensitivity check, we examine whether the underlying causal or statistical assumptions for the fuzzy RD design are warranted. We verify the effectiveness of our approach via a simulation study and demonstrate its application by studying the effect of extended time accommodations using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The relationship between concentrated poverty and educational outcomes has received substantial attention in academic research over the last 3 decades. Researchers have argued that neighborhood characteristics are associated with academic achievement, educational attainment, dropout rates, college entry, cognitive abilities, attendance, and grade repetition. Given that Black students constitute a large proportion of those living in concentrated poverty, coupled with the urgency of contemporary times where state-sanctioned violence is on full display in the United States, assessing how education scholars are conceptualizing concentrated poverty is vital. Utilizing an antiblackness lens to critically review 64 recent articles addressing concentrated poverty and educational outcomes, we explicitly drew on anti-Black scholarship to expand the discourse from “concentrated poverty” to a “concentrated debt.” A concentrated debt constitutes education, racial capital, placemaking, and humanity debts. We argue that to address these debts, we must move beyond deficits, lacks, and disorganization of Black neighborhoods and toward humanizing Black students and their families by investing in their homes, schools, and communities.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>I examine how youth racialized and gendered as Black girls co-conspired to challenge misogynoir with their peers racialized and gendered as Latina/x and Polynesian girls. I investigate how they did so within an after-school space at a public charter high school that came to be known as the “Critical Feminisms Club.” Thinking about the space alongside the girls in the club, I reveal how they politically and pedagogically engaged love to (a) (re)author the stories of Black girls and (b) challenge the material and ideological misogynoir that circumscribed Black girls’ lives, possibilities, and futurities within their lives and schooling. They (re)narrated how they should be in relation with and responsible to each other as collective, co-relational, and interdependent beings, recognizing how Black womanness/girlness was a genre of being human that was specifically targeted for enclosure, exploitation, and elimination. Their love-politics engaged pedagogy to remake the world such that the safety and protection of Black girls and gender-nonconforming youth was a necessity and priority, which they saw in turn as bound to the safety and protection of the non-Black identified Latina/x and Polynesian girls who accepted this interdependence and mutual responsibility.

          Abstract
                  <p>Across many countries, including New Zealand, diverse groups including indigenous, migrant, and marginalised communities, are under-represented in mathematics, as evidenced by achievement disparities and disengagement from higher-level mathematics. Both research and policy have focused on developing equitable education outcomes for all students. A key aspect of this is wellbeing, including within mathematics classrooms, which includes identifying classroom environments that enable wellbeing. This study examines mathematical wellbeing (MWB) across different ethnicities and genders, with a case study focus on students from Pacific heritages. Analysing qualitative responses from over 12,000 diverse students revealed that positive relationships in the mathematics classroom were most commonly associated with students’ MWB. Accomplishment and cognitive factors, including mathematical accuracy, learning new things, and understanding, were also identified as important. Minor gender differences emerged, with female students emphasising mathematical understanding, accuracy, and relationships more than male students. The Pacific student case study highlighted the importance of both cognitive aspects (learning new things and understanding) and relationships (peer and teacher support), uncovering an alignment between cultural values and MWB. This study empirically confirms seven universal values supporting student MWB, previously identified in Australian and Chinese contexts, suggesting that teachers internationally may align pedagogical practices with these values to support most students’ MWB. However, the instrumental values serving these universal values appear culturally unique. This research contributes novel insights to the field by examining wellbeing with a subject-specific focus through student-generated responses, offering implications for developing more equitable and culturally inclusive mathematics classrooms.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In the digital age, the range of digital technologies used in mathematics education grows. Since beliefs are affective-cognitive elements that significantly determine teachers' behavior in the classroom, they are an interesting field of research in mathematics education. A review of previous research has identified different groups of beliefs about the use of digital technologies in mathematics classes. These studies are not focused on specific digital technologies. In an empirical case study that is presented in this paper, the aim was to figure out how beliefs that can be described specifically about the use of visual programming relate to general beliefs about the use of digital technologies in mathematics education. A qualitative content analysis of the reflection journals of seven undergraduate mathematics education students on their work with Scratch, a visual programming environment, in a university seminar led to the formation of ten belief categories about the use of visual programming in mathematics classes. Most of the beliefs are associated with a positive attitude towards visual programming in mathematics education. However, some beliefs could also be identified that refer to the limits and challenges of using visual programming and thus demonstrate rather negative associations. Only a few of the categories identified match the list of belief groups about digital technologies in mathematics education identified in previous research. Some possible reasons for these results are discussed and further research interests in the field of beliefs about the use of digital technologies are suggested.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>As a person obsessed, perhaps overly so, with preventing water damage, an ailing dishwasher led to a system whereby who did the dishes in our household became a matter of chance. What happened next, however, was besmirchment of my character from hockey teammates, close friends, and especially from a room full of future elementary school mathematics teachers. Most individuals, from those casting aspersions, were not even able to support their slander by, for example, providing me with a simple solution, the kind you would find in the back of a school mathematics textbook, demonstrating that the dishwasher system I had implemented was unfair. Making matters worse, data collected from a simulation of my system did not result in probabilistic discussions regarding order mattering, the number of outcomes, the assignment of labels, lists or diagrams; rather, a flimsily understanding of the data resulted in a rather raucous echo chamber where my fate was sealed. Unable to sit idly by any longer, I proposed a tweak to the system, which preyed on a school yard notion of fairness, that helped me regain my honour and perhaps proved that revenge is a dish best served cold.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we present research on eight kindergarten and eight first-grade students’ understandings of the arithmetic properties of commutativity, additive identity, and additive inverse during a classroom teaching experiment, selected from a larger study that included 88 students. In this study, we explore the students’ types of understandings in terms of Skemp’s (1987) framework (instrumental and relational), the basic relationships in the conceptual field of additive structures (combination, transformation, and comparison), and their performance on different problems involving numerical operations, equations, and word problems. Our findings show that students performed better on additive identity and additive inverse properties. Problems involving substituting and simplifying expressions that combined two properties had a lower performance rate. The differences in understandings and performance observed between kindergarten and first-grade students have implications for instructional design geared to introduce arithmetic properties in the early grades. This study highlights the difference between correctly solving a problem and providing evidence of a relational understanding.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The future of teaching will increasingly rely on overseas-trained teachers (OTTs) to address teacher shortages. While research on OTTs in the United States is expanding, studies focusing on Afro-Caribbean teachers are emerging. Despite the growing call for more teachers of color, Afro-Caribbean OTTs’ contributions are often overlooked due to their immigrant status. We propose the concepts of “radical transparency” and “fugitive care” to articulate how these teachers’ classroom practices offer alternative possibilities for schooling, making the learning process both explicit and equitable for all students. Drawing on a Transnational Black Feminist Framework (TBF), we highlight the unique politics of care practiced by these teachers, revealing gaps in our cultural understanding and underscoring their vital, yet understudied, contributions to education.
