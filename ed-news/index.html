          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Historically, Black educators have played a critical role in Black youth's well-being. Consequently, they are often assumed to “naturally” engage culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP), obscuring the diverse ways Black individuals identify, think, and behave regarding race and culture. This psychological survey study examines in-service Black educators’ (N = 238) multidimensional racial identity attitudes, background sociodemographics, and education contexts (postsecondary and current/teaching) in relation to their varied enactments of three CRP domains (African American Curriculum, Culturally Relevant Teaching, Sociopolitical Commitment). Results show CRP variation across individuals according to their racial identity attitudes, backgrounds, and contexts. The resulting conceptual framework advances research and discourse on teacher race by challenging homogenizing, detrimental narratives. Findings have important implications for teacher workforce diversification, training, and retention.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines how the student transportation options available to families affect which schools are accessible to them in a choice-based setting. The study has two parts. First, we compare commute times by foot, public transit, school bus, and car. We show that providing school bus service reduces commute times and improves access for families without cars, but access to a car fundamentally shapes families’ options. Second, we explore the relationship between neighborhood-level measures of vehicle access and families’ school requests and placements. Car access is strongly associated with school requests and placements even after accounting for neighborhood characteristics. We consider car access as a pathway by which wealth disparities produce educational disparities in settings that emphasize school choice.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Behaviour change communication (BCC) remains a central component of the interventions used in the fight against malaria in Ghana. However, there is limited evidence of its effectiveness. This study evaluated the effects of BCC strategies on knowledge (symptoms, causes and prevention) and overall knowledge of malaria among Ghanaian women aged 15–49 years. The propensity score matching (PSM) approach and logistic regression were used to analyse data from the 2016 edition of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). Women who participated in community-level education or heard/saw media messages on malaria, or both, had significantly more knowledge of the disease than women who lacked access to any of these mediums of communication. The effect of these strategies on women’s overall knowledge of malaria is about 2% to 4% and is higher on their knowledge of the symptoms (3% to 6%) and prevention (2% to 4%) than the causes (2%). The combined effects of both mediums of communication are relatively higher than the effect of either of them as a single medium of communication. Further analysis showed that improved knowledge of the disease is associated with higher preventive measures taken by women for themselves and for their children. The results are more significant in rural and poor households than in urban and non-poor households. These findings underscore the need for the Ministry of Health and its partner institutions to adopt an innovative approach which combines the two strategies in intensively educating Ghanaians, and women in particular, on the symptoms and prevention of malaria, giving due cognisance to households’ socioeconomic status and geographical location.

          Abstract
                  <p>In order to identify the potential benefits and challenges of implementing student portfolios as quality mathematics assessment, a pilot study was conducted with teachers in various secondary school settings. The multi-case study consisted of five teacher participants from geographically and demographically differing contexts, four in the USA and one in Canada. They were interviewed and surveyed, exploring their motivations for utilizing a portfolio system of mathematics assessment for the 2020–2021 school year, the design of their portfolio system, and resultant impacts on student dispositions around mathematics. Each participating teacher implemented different structures of portfolio assessment, including the types of items included and how the items were assessed. Results showed that compared to traditional multiple-choice tests, teachers felt portfolios were a better reflection of their students’ “extra-mathematical” skills, such as problem-solving and persistence. Teacher surveys and interviews also demonstrated confidence that the use of portfolios as assessment was superior to more traditional measures in terms of adhering to good pedagogical practices. Through questionnaire data and interviews, teachers reported portfolios were particularly beneficial for students for whom English is not their primary language, as well as students with special needs. The paper lays the groundwork for additional research studies in the area of student mathematics portfolios based on the provided framework.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In 2011, South Korea introduced the Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education policy in line with the worldwide emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. This study aims to examine the perspectives of the stakeholders involved in the implementation of the STEAM education policy. To accomplish this, a qualitative research design was utilized, and inductive analysis was employed to collect and interpret the viewpoints of 13 stakeholders. These stakeholders encompassed policymakers, national institution directors, regional supervisors, administrators, principals, STEAM lead teachers, and mathematics teachers who created the STEAM-based curriculum in South Korea. Our findings reveal conflicting perspectives among the stakeholders regarding STEAM education. Our analysis also suggests that stakeholders’ participation in STEAM education is discontinuous and driven by the policy wave. Several impediments faced by mathematics teachers were also recognized, including obstacles in aligning STEAM-incorporated mathematics instruction with assessments, inadequate financial and curriculum assistance, and complications within the school climate. We discuss potential components that could affect the success of STEAM education and the conditions necessary for its successful implementation: (1) the need for consensus on the level of policy support; (2) the need for sustainable policy support; and (3) the need for policymakers’ consideration to connect the STEAM education policy with real mathematics classrooms.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Coordination of theoretical probability and relative frequency estimates is challenging in probability teaching and learning. Modeling is one of the ways of teaching and learning that facilitates inquiry between these two perspectives. Given that, we designed a modeling activity to support fifteen secondary students in investigating theoretical probabilities, relative frequencies, and the corresponding relationship and in estimating the true probability. We analyzed how the design of a modeling activity can afford students’ coordination of the two probability perspectives and the difficulties in the process. This analysis shows that adopting an asymmetric random process and having students extend their models of a simple event to a compound event are helpful for students to coordinate probability perspectives. However, potential obstacles to coordination include an authority issue and statistical bias.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>A growing quantitative literature finds evidence that student teaching placements predict later outcomes of teacher candidates and their students, but there is little large-scale quantitative evidence about the mechanisms for these estimated relationships. We used data from a survey of STEM teachers in Washington State to better understand how their perceptions of preparation were related to student teaching placements and current classroom environment. We found evidence that the composition of students in student teaching classrooms was predictive of STEM teachers’ perceptions of their preparation. For example, STEM teachers who student taught in classrooms with more English language learners and economically disadvantaged students reported feeling prepared to teach these specific student populations. Likewise, STEM teachers who student taught in high-poverty classrooms tended to report feeling better prepared to manage their current classroom, particularly if they were currently teaching in a high-poverty classroom.

          Abstract
                  <p>The study investigated the effects of the use of dynamic computer visualizations (DCVs) integrated with the POE (Predict-Observe-Explain) sequence on learners’ understanding and retention of solubility and on their motivation to learn chemistry. In the research, nonequivalent groups pretest–posttest control and comparison group design was used. The study was conducted on 56 freshmen enrolled in the science teacher education program at a mid-sized university in northwestern Turkey. One of the two classes was randomly assigned as an experimental group (n = 31), and the other was assigned as a control group (n = 25). The data were collected using the Solubility Concept Test (SCT), Chemistry Motivation Questionnaire-II (CMQ-II), Molecular Level Visualization Test (MLVT), and Questionnaire of Students’ Perceptions of DCVs (QSP-DCVs). The quantitative data were analyzed using repeated-measures MANOVA, and the qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The results indicated that the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence was more effective on learners’ understanding of solubility than the traditional lecturer-centered narrative-based teaching method. It was found that some prior misconceptions were retained or reinforced even though the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence was used. This study also found that the use of DCVs integrated with the POE sequence had a considerable significant effect on learners’ retention of what they learned. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the change taking place in motivation towards chemistry between the experimental and control group, experimental group learners’ perceptions of the use of DCVs were quite positive. Based on the study, it is concluded that DCVs integrated with the POE sequence can be used as an effective way to improve learners’ understanding and retention of fundamental chemistry concepts.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The comments teachers write when sending students to the office have the potential to increase our understanding of how bias may contribute to longstanding racial disparities in school discipline. However, large-scale analysis of open text has traditionally had a prohibitive cost. Through natural language processing techniques, we examined over 3.5 million office discipline records from national samples of more than 4,000 schools for whether teachers’ linguistic patterns differed when describing incidents depending on the race/ethnicity and gender of the students. Results of such analyses consistently showed that teachers wrote longer descriptions and included more negative emotion when disciplining Black compared to White students, especially for Black girls. In conjunction with psychology of language theory, the patterns suggest that teachers may perceive and process student behavior differently depending on student identities. Implications of the findings and potential for research on naturally occurring language data in education are discussed.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Principals can affect several consequential schooling processes and outcomes. However, their effectiveness varies substantially and is distributed across schools inequitably, underscoring the importance of effective principal professional development (PPD), which begins by using needs assessments to inform PPD content. A researcher-practitioner partnership assessed principal needs via monthly teacher surveys about specific teacher evaluation skills. While internal consistencies were high, test-rest reliabilities were low, implying that reports regarding the quality of specific principal practices may fluctuate substantially over short periods, potentially hampering the design of effective PPD.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Using 7 years of administrative data from North Carolina public schools (NCPS), we track changes in teacher and principal attrition and mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess how attrition is related to characteristics of educators and schools. We find that educator attrition and mobility increased sharply between Fall 2020 and Fall 2022. Data from the pandemic period indicate that educators of color and more effective educators have experienced larger increases in attrition than their White and less effective peers. Gaps in teacher attrition have narrowed between schools educating many versus few historically marginalized students.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent research has examined the influential role coaches may play in supporting teachers’ collective capacity building for instructional improvement. While emerging research is promising, much remains to be learned about collaborative approaches to coaching, particularly in schools with the greatest opportunity gaps. We draw on extensive longitudinal qualitative data to explore a collaborative approach to coaching in urban middle schools under pressure to improve math outcomes. Findings reveal key coaching strategies to promote teacher team capacity building, including fostering student-centered discussion and collaborative relationships, tailoring capacity-building opportunities to provide access for all teachers, and negotiating across teachers and leaders to support improvement efforts. This work was complicated by conflicting expectations between leaders and teachers as well as challenges with addressing teachers’ misconceptions about math content in group settings. These findings reflect the need for ongoing capacity building that supports coaches as they attend to group dynamics and accountability pressures.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are typically considered the gold standard of program evaluation, they are infrequently chosen by public sector leaders, defined as government and nonprofit decision-makers, when an impact evaluation is required. Objectives: This study provides descriptive evidence on RCT aversion among public sector leaders and attempts to understand what factors affect their likelihood of choosing RCTs for impact evaluations. Research Design: The authors ask if public sector leaders follow similar preference patterns found among non-public sector leaders when choosing either an RCT or a quasi-experimental design and use a survey experiment to determine which factors affect the RCT choice. Subjects: The study sample includes 2050 public sector leaders and a comparison group of 2060 respondents who do not lead public sector organizations. Measures: The primary outcome measure is selecting an RCT as the preferred evaluation option. Results: When asked to make a decision about an impact evaluation, the majority of people do not choose an RCT. While also averse to RCTs, public sector leaders are about 13% more likely to prefer a RCT to a quasi-experimental evaluation compared to the general population. Public sector leaders are less likely to use RCTs for evaluations of more intense interventions, potentially because they are perceived to be superior to the options available for the control group. Conclusion: Funders should be aware that when given a choice, public sector leaders prefer other options to RCTs. Greater awareness of the benefits of RCTs could increase their use in the public sector.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are the assessment tools that provide valuable formative feedback about skill mastery at both the individual and population level. Recent work has explored the performance of CDMs with small sample sizes but has focused solely on the estimates of individual profiles. The current research focuses on obtaining accurate estimates of skill mastery at the population level. We introduce a novel algorithm (bagging algorithm for deterministic inputs noisy “and” gate) that is inspired by ensemble learning methods in the machine learning literature and produces more stable and accurate estimates of the population skill mastery profile distribution for small sample sizes. Using both simulated data and real data from the Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods on several metrics in a wide variety of scenarios.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Although research alliances (RAs) have long been seen as mutualistic and reciprocal, RAs face numerous obstacles navigating stakeholders’ differing goals, incentives, and information. This longitudinal, comparative case study of two RAs uses principal-agent theory to analyze these interdependent challenges and their relationship to RA strategy and design. Findings suggest that while some RAs may be better designed to balance the competing interests of various stakeholders, increasingly contested definitions of RA effectiveness among those stakeholders have muddled RA identities. As a result, RA researchers are now often held to expectations that their organizations were not originally designed to meet. We argue that this has implications for how RAs are funded, designed, and, ultimately, evaluated.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper focuses on the process and theory of action-research for transformation (ART) targeting individual transformation as a required means for global change. Addressing the lack of a practical framework to organize and report transformation, we conceptualise, identify and demonstrate an approach by linking ART with Interiority and Constructive Development Theory. Interiority focuses on the individual’s sense-making as it relates to the sensed world and provides direction for data to be collected. Crucially, the individual’s capacity for sense-making impacts how data are identified, experienced, interpreted and evaluated. It is shifts in this capacity that constitute fundamental transformation required to better handle complexity and ambiguity - intrinsic to ART. We propose Constructive Developmental Interiority (CDI) that provides a lens to recognise, analyse and frame constructive developmental shifts. Two case studies are presented in which researchers engaged in applying CDI for transformation. Both cases highlight, through first-person action-research and reflexive collaboration, that although the will to address developmental transformational challenges was an espoused motivation, its misalignment with the capacities for transformative change is always a possibility. Applying CDI reveals the nature of the challenge (time, effort and support), how transitions were made, and the potential for transformational impact.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Recessions may disproportionally affect school districts, especially with established fiscal institutions and policies including balanced budget requirements, tax and expenditure limitations, and school finance reforms. Analyzing the Great Recession and school districts in the United States between 2003 and 2016, we estimated difference-in-differences models leveraging variation in state recession severity to evaluate revenue and expenditure impacts as well as to measure differential recession effects for districts exposed to and not exposed to fiscal institutions and policies. Although revenues and expenditures increased relative to pre-recession levels in all districts, increases were much larger in school districts with less severe than more severe recessions. Balanced budget requirements exacerbated recession effects for low-income districts, and local tax and expenditure limitations intensified recession effects for high-income districts. School finance reforms worsened recession effects for all districts. Our findings can aid districts in understanding potential recessionary impacts, given their prior established fiscal policies and institutions.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Co-teaching and related collaborative models of instruction are widely used in primary and secondary schools in many school systems. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of such models on students’ academic achievement and how these effects are moderated by factors of theoretical and practical relevance. Although previous research and reviews have asserted that the evidence base is scarce, we found 128 treatment and control group studies from 1984 to 2020. We excluded 52 studies due to critical risk of bias via Cochrane’s risk of bias assessment tools and conducted a meta-analysis of 76 studies. This yielded 280 short-term effect sizes, of which 82% were pretest-adjusted. We found a moderate, positive, and statistically significant mean effect of [math] = .11, 95% confidence interval [.035, .184] of collaborative instruction compared to single-taught controls, using the correlated-hierarchical effects (CHE-RVE) model. From moderator analyses, we found that collaborative instruction yields effects of mostly the same size, whether the interventions involved trained teachers or assistants with no teaching qualifications. This implies a potential for the expansion of such interventions at lower costs than otherwise expected. Moreover, factors that are highlighted in the co-teaching literature as preconditions for the effectiveness of collaborative instruction did not explain variations in effect sizes. Finally, we found no clear evidence for publication bias or small study effects. Notably, a large number of the studies that we drew upon were nonrandomized studies; and therefore, more rigorous experimental research is needed, especially on relevant co-teaching interventions.
