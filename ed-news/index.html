          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article used a rich longitudinal data set from four school districts in California to study absenteeism patterns among students classified as an English learner (EL). We looked at absence patterns overall and disaggregated by EL classification, grade level, and pre/post COVID-19. When their demographic and school-level factors are considered, ELs have fewer absences and are less likely to be chronically absent than non-EL students. This finding is evident for all EL classified groups, although the differences in absenteeism for long-term EL (LTEL) and newcomer EL students are markedly smaller than for other EL subgroups. The negative absenteeism patterns for ELs shifted after the COVID-19 pandemic. EL-classified students experienced higher absenteeism rates during the pandemic even when holding other factors constant. This rising absenteeism trend is most evident for current ELs and LTELs.

          Abstract
                  <p>Experienced P-12 teachers play a crucial role in the learning of preservice mathematics teachers, though the preparation provided them can be inconsistent or even lacking. In this paper, we share two case studies of secondary mathematics teachers serving as mentor teachers as they engage in a professional development experience designed to shift both their mentoring practice and their perceptions of their roles as mentor teachers. To this end, we simultaneously leveraged Feiman-Nemser’s vision of educative mentoring and NCTM’s effective teaching practices to create a semester-long professional development opportunity focused on practice-based educative mentoring. Drawing on written reflections and video recorded planning and debriefing discussions between two sets of mentors and preservice teachers, we developed profiles of two mentor teachers as they refined their mentoring practice. Based on our findings, we suggest a set of key elements for a professional development framework for practice-based educative mentoring.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Maternal, neonatal, and child health play crucial roles in achieving the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2030, particularly in promoting health and wellbeing. However, maternal, neonatal, and child services in Moroccan public hospitals face challenges, particularly concerning mortality rates and inefficient resource allocation, which hinder optimal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the operational effectiveness of 76 neonatal and child health services networks (MNCSN) within Moroccan public hospitals. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), we assessed technical efficiency (TE) employing both Variable Returns to Scale for inputs (VRS-I) and outputs (VRS-O) orientation. Additionally, the Tobit method (TM) was utilized to explore factors influencing inefficiency, with hospital, doctor, and paramedical staff considered as inputs, and admissions, cesarean interventions, functional capacity, and hospitalization days as outputs. Our findings revealed that VRS-I exhibited a higher average TE score of 0.76 compared to VRS-O (0.23). Notably, the Casablanca-Anfa MNCSN received the highest referrals (30) under VRS-I, followed by the Khemisset MNCSN (24). In contrast, under VRS-O, Ben Msick, Rabat, and Mediouna MNCSN each had three peers, with 71, 22, and 17 references, respectively. Moreover, the average Malmquist Index under VRS-I indicated a 7.7% increase in productivity over the 9-year study period, while under VRS-O, the average Malmquist Index decreased by 8.7%. Furthermore, doctors and functional bed capacity received the highest Tobit model score of 0.01, followed by hospitalization days and cesarean sections. This study underscores the imperative for policymakers to strategically prioritize input factors to enhance efficiency and ensure optimal maternal, neonatal, and child healthcare outcomes.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study assessed the effectiveness of a spatialized mathematics intervention on the mathematical performance and spatial visualization skills of students from an underprivileged Indonesian community. Grade 8 students (N = 407) were assigned to one of twelve experimental classes, receiving the spatial mathematics intervention, or one of seven control classes, continuing with the standard mathematics curriculum. Prior to and following the intervention, a pre-test and post-test design was administered. The data were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance to ascertain the effect of the intervention. Results revealed that the students in the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in spatial visualization skills and mathematics performance (including both spatial and non-spatial competencies), compared to the control group. Importantly, the findings provide evidence that the transfer effects of the spatialized curriculum occur differentially for students of varying ability levels. The findings highlight the importance of spatial intervention in enhancing mathematics performance and spatial visualization skills. The study suggests potential avenues for a paradigm shift in mathematics education that recognizes and embraces the profound influence of spatial thinking.</p>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reports on reflection-based monitoring tools developed and used in an action research project to improve gender equality in science and research institutions. Several of these tools were developed to facilitate individual and joint reflection from the perspective of the co-researchers involved. The aim of the article is to make the case for the integration of a systematic reflection-based monitoring approach, to describe its approach and theoretical underpinnings that link critical reflection theory with reflexive action learning theory, and to present the details of six monitoring tools so that they can be adopted in other project settings. It also highlights how these monitoring tools stimulated both individual and group reflection and how they facilitated the sharing of knowledge and experience between change agents involved in co-production. The article also shows that the process monitoring approach based on systematic reflection can contribute to successful project implementation and offers several important advantages.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study describes the effects of a small pedagogical intervention in first semester calculus at an engineering college; it is a collaboration between two lecturers: a pure mathematician and a mathematics education researcher, who wished to learn about the effects of self-work (i.e., students solving problems on their own during class) on students' exam achievements, self-efficacy, and students' written communication. Students were given mastery experiences of self-work and feedback in three out of five classes. In all five classes, students were given in-class quizzes with peer instruction. Data was collected in multiple forms: quiz results, questionnaires, exam questions, and reflections; both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods were used. The findings show self-work increases students’ engagement and self-efficacy and slightly improved students’ achievement in class and on the final exam grade. Moreover, it positively influences students' learning experience. There were nonconclusive findings for improvement in the quality of students' written communication in the final exam. Self-work can be easily incorporated, even in coordinated courses with a common syllabus and a large lecture, without requiring instructors to make big changes to their lecture style. Effects of self-work should be further studied.</p>
