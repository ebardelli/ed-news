          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 42-46, April 2023. <br>The school lives of students and educators have long been affected by technological changes, but the advent of digital technologies, from smartphones to social media, have amplified the effects on their daily lives. Unfortunately, school curricula rarely focus on critically examining our relationships with technologies. Daniel G. Krutka, Jacob Pleasants, and T. Philip Nichols offer a framework called the technology education iceberg to help educators plan and reflect on how they teach about technology. They argue that the science, social studies, and English subject areas offer opportunities to encourage a technoskeptical stance in students and educators that is needed for flourishing lives and democratic societies.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 47-53, April 2023. <br>Schools have become increasingly interested in social-emotional learning (SEL) over the past decade, and that interest has grown due to concern about student well-being resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is confusion around SEL. Christi Bergin, Christina Cipriano, Tia Barnes, Shannon B. Wanless, researchers who have studied and designed SEL for decades, respond to questions frequently asked by educators as they consider an SEL approach for their school. They discuss what SEL is, its benefits, how it aligns with other programs, how to select an SEL program, and where to learn more about SEL programs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 30-35, April 2023. <br>Online extremism is on the rise, with boys and young men being targeted by misogynistic social media influencers like Andrew Tate. When boys repeat comments they’ve heard online in the classroom, educators can play a role in preventing students from being further influenced by online extremism. Pasha Dashtgard, the director of research at American University’s Polarization &amp; Extremism Research &amp; Innovation Lab (PERIL), talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the importance of prevention, the harms of toxic masculinity, and the crucial role of teachers and other educators.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 36-41, April 2023. <br>Efforts to improve education outcomes often involve lengthening the school day or the school year in hopes that spending more time in school will boost student learning. Yet, as Frederick Hess explains, U.S. students spend as much or more total time in school as their peers in other industrialized nations. What matters more than the amount of time is how that time is used. Although research into time usage at school is limited, existing studies have shown that much time spent in school time does not involve actual learning time, either because of interruptions or other non-learning activities or because students are not engaged. Hess suggests that, before adding time to the school day or year, it’s important to understand what schools are doing with their time, rethink their routines, and seek to ensure that they are using time wisely and well.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 54-57, April 2023. <br>Despite being regarded as the great equalizer, public education’s close ties with the market economy have made it the great perpetuator. High school teacher Jonathan Lancaster writes that public education has become a structure in which students become career ready, as opposed to world ready. Therefore, educators should shift the narrative away from the how of education, and more toward the why of education.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 62-63, April 2023. <br>Title IX, the federal law that protects against sex discrimination in schools, is frequently considered a law to protect women from bias, harassment, and assault. However, in recent years, it has also been used to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ students and of men. Robert Kim describes how male victims of harassment have been able to seek justice under Title IX. At the same time, men accused of harassment have turned to the law when they believe that anti-male bias drove the decisions to punish them.

A middle school math teacher is finding that more boys than girls in her class are risk-averse when it comes to math. A high school teacher has noticed that a lot of her students are getting sick and missing class when there’s a test.

Teresa Preston, Kappan’s editor-in-chief, previews the April 2023 Kappan on “Educating Boys.” The articles in the issue describe the importance of role models for boys of color, for boys who might excel in the humanities, and for boys who are vulnerable to the influence of online misogynists and provocateurs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 6-11, April 2023. <br>Since the early 1980s, young women have outpaced men in educational outcomes. The gender gap is even more pronounced among Black and Latinx students. Moreover, these academic gaps have widened since the pandemic. Based on a five-year study of a district-wide initiative designed to improve academic outcomes for Black and Latino males, Adriana Villavicencio lays out a three-pronged approach to supporting the socioemotional well-being and academic success of young men of color through 1) culturally relevant classrooms, 2) improved school relationships, and 3) robust academic and college preparation.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 12-17, April 2023. <br>Misalignment between the mandates and structures of formal schooling and the developmental needs of boys, particularly in the humanities, is receiving increased levels of public and scholarly attention. The problems may be especially acute for low-income and minoritized children. But little guidance for identifying and implementing best and promising practices is available for educators. Tim Spitsberg and Jonathan A. Plucker outline recent work on this problem and identify some promising state- and local-level strategies for beginning the hard work of improving humanities learning for boys. They advocate pairing common-sense policy and curricular changes (improved data-sharing, curricular reviews for gender bias) with research-supported interventions (personalization, pathways programs into humanities-based learning and professions). When implemented with care, these strategies could improve the education of all students.

Carter Andrews examined data from focus groups conducted with more than 60 Black boys in midwestern high schools to learn how teachers and schools can refuse antiblackness and reimagine futures for Black boys in school. Black boys and young men want safe school environments and will create safe communal spaces when needed. They seek teachers who are culturally relevant; they want to be able to trust their teachers; and they want to be their full, authentic selves at school. Findings show how educators can work within antiblack institutions toward reducing in-school suffering while working to create better futures for Black boys in school.

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Friday, 31. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we analyse a grade 8 (age 13–14) Japanese problem-solving lesson involving angles associated with parallel lines, taught by a highly regarded, expert Japanese mathematics teacher. The focus of our observation was on how the teacher used carefully planned board work to support a rich and extensive plenary discussion (neriage) in which he shifted the focus from individual mathematical solutions to generalised properties. By comparing the teacher’s detailed prior planning of the board work (bansho) with that which he produced during the lesson, we distinguish between aspects of the lesson that he considered essential and those he treated as contingent. Our analysis reveals how the careful planning of the board work enabled the teacher to be free to explore with the students the multiple alternative solution methods that they had produced, while at the same time having a clear overall purpose relating to how angle properties can be used to find additional solution methods. We outline how these findings from within the strong tradition of the Japanese problem-solving lesson might inform research and teaching practice outside of Japan, where a deep heritage of bansho and neriage is not present. In particular, we highlight three prominent features of this teacher’s practice: the detailed lesson planning in which particular solutions were prioritised for discussion; the considerable amount of time given over to student generation and comparison of alternative solutions; and the ways in which the teacher’s use of the board was seen to support the richness of the mathematical discussions.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>In this study, hypothetical samples of students’ work on a task involving pattern generalizations were used to examine the characteristics of the ways in which 154 elementary prospective teachers (PSTs) paid attention to students’ work in mathematics. The analysis included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their suggestions for supporting students’ further learning. While the findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of mathematical learning, their analyses of students’ thinking and their ideas for supporting students’ learning lacked sophistication. Also, there was considerable divergence between the students’ thinking as evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs’ suggested support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for teacher education.</p>
