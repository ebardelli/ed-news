          Abstract
                  <p>Social institutions function not only by reproducing specific practices but also by reproducing discourses endowing such practices with meaning. The latter in turn is related to the development of the identities or subjectivities of those who live and thrive within such institutions. Meaning and subjectivity are therefore significant sociological categories involved in the functioning of complex social phenomena such as that of mathematical instruction. The present paper provides a discursive analysis centered on these categories of the influential OECD’s PISA mathematics frameworks. As we shall see, meaning as articulated by the OECD primarily stresses the utilitarian value of mathematics to individuals and to society at large. Furthermore, molding students’ subjectivities towards endorsing such articulation of meaning is emphasized as an educational objective, either explicitly or implicitly, as connected to the OECD’s definition of mathematical literacy. Therefore, the OECD’s discourses do not only serve to reproduce the type of mathematical instruction implied in the organization’s services concerning education, but also concomitantly provide a potentially most effective educational technology through which the demand of these very services may be reproduced.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Few studies have shared insights on how principals invite student voice to enact equitable leadership practice. The purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which principals demonstrated their commitment to equity via advocating for student voice using in-depth interview data from six school principals in the United States. We present three findings that contribute to the field of leadership and student voice: (a) motivation for student voice, (b) desires and concerns for student future, and (c) student voice for authentic learning. This study advances how school leaders develop student democratic agency and critical consciousness through pursuing and welcoming student voice.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>A recent study published in Educational Researcher by White (2023) examined superintendent gender gaps. This work required 4 years of internet searches to identify and match superintendent names with each of the roughly 13,000 school districts in the United States. Although this study provided important insights into the superintendent gender gaps, the study is unable to examine gaps for females of color or the long-term career pathways of superintendents. The lack of a national longitudinal superintendent dataset has meant researchers and policymakers have limited insights into superintendent racial and gender gaps, turnover rates, experience, and career pathways to the superintendency. Drawing on data from the Texas State Longitudinal Data System, we offer several findings to provide a glimpse of what could be accomplished with a longitudinal dataset. Policymakers, school boards, search firms, and communities will fail to understand the full range of challenges and opportunities to diversifying and strengthening the superintendent workforce until such a dataset exists and is accessible to researchers and other interested parties.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>With a goal of contextualizing teacher job dissatisfaction during the first full school year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we contrast teachers’ experiences with the decade and a half leading up to the pandemic. We draw on nationally representative data from the Schools and Staffing Survey and National Teacher and Principal Survey from the 2003–04 to 2020–21 school years. Through descriptive and regression analysis, we show that (1) increases in teacher dissatisfaction beginning in the 2015–16 school year persisted into the 2020–21 school year, (2) levels of dissatisfaction during the pandemic were not equal across subpopulations of teachers, and (3) positive working conditions consistently predicted lower job dissatisfaction, including in the 2020–21 school year.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The World Bank’s (WB) growing emphasis on decentralizing educational systems has sparked widespread discussion in the literature. This study examines whether WB reforms are indeed associated with decentralizing educational systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as commonly assumed. Using unique, untapped country-level panel data on 30 LMICs from 1990 to 2019, I do not find a significant association between the WB’s actions and changes observed in educational systems. Employing the institutional logics perspective, I argue that the WB’s diffusion of “homogeneous” educational reforms may clash with “heterogeneous” socioeconomic, political, and cultural contexts, thus hindering the direct translation of reforms into tangible outcomes on the ground.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Educational interpreters are not neutral mediators of messages. In education, they are policy brokers whose translations can reflect their own social identities and often align with larger social power dynamics, including deficit perspectives of racialized multilingual people. In U.S. schools, language minoritized parents have the right to make decisions about their children’s education; yet current theory does not account for their power to shape educational policies—or the political roles of interpreters who represent their negotiations. I propose a theory of interpreters as invisible policy brokers and identity mediators. I employ an approach that centers the questions and agency of newly arrived, predominantly Spanish-speaking mothers in a Midwest school district with growing demographics of language minoritized students.

          Abstract
                  <p>The importance of understanding what and how mathematics teachers notice is well documented, but more research is needed on content-specific noticing. In particular, knowing how teachers notice proportional reasoning, a vital topic spanning all grades of mathematics, could inform measures that support students’ proportional reasoning. We examined how teachers noticed when responding to two prompts (one student-focused and one teacher–student-interaction-focused) after watching a video of a middle grades proportional reasoning lesson. We analyzed the proportional reasoning reported from 13 elementary and 20 secondary prospective teachers and used cooccurrences along with noticing practices to describe how teachers noticed proportional reasoning and what aspects of proportional reasoning they noticed. Results indicate: (a) the two prompts resulted in differences in what and how participants noticed proportional reasoning, (b) participants were primarily descriptive and not interpretative when describing the proportional reasoning they noticed, and (c) the elementary and secondary prospective teachers both noticed similar aspects of proportional reasoning but showed differences in how the proportional reasoning cooccurred with the noticing practices. These findings reiterate the importance of the prompts used with teachers, the potential of using video to advance teachers’ noticing of proportional reasoning, and the methodological potential of using cooccurrences to examine teachers’ content-specific noticing.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper presents the results of a quantitative study investigating the development of teachers' attitudes and self-efficacy expectations for inclusive mathematics instruction in the context of an in-service training that was designed in a blended learning format and compared to an unsupported online offer. In the blended learning format, 101 teachers participated in an in-service training, designed as a combination of six workshops with concrete activities based on materials for inclusive mathematics teaching and intermittent practical phases with collaborative learning environments for children aged 6–12 years. The teachers' attitudes toward inclusive mathematics instruction and self-efficacy expectations are collected by using published scales (KIESEL) and scales under development. The effects of the blended learning program are analyzed by the t test for dependent samples or the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared to the effects of an online offer without further guidance and support. On the one hand, the results indicate the importance of the blended learning program in comparison with the unsupported online offer. On the other hand, they show insights into the relevance of the participants' interaction with the materials during the concrete activities as well as of their try outs in and their reflection on teaching practice during the intermittent practical phases.</p>

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Monday, 26. February 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Research on how coaches talk with teachers during coaching cycles is underdeveloped. We analyzed 1,649 discourse moves from 24 mathematics content-focused coaching cycles to determine the extent to which coaches’ discursive tendencies vary. We explored variation between coaches, between planning and debriefing conversations, and between cycles for the same coach–teacher pair. Findings indicate there existed significant variability in the coaches’ discourse moves during coaching cycles. We also found discursive differences from planning to debriefing meetings, noting that coaches were more directive and less reflective in planning conversations compared with debriefing conversations. Across multiple coaching cycles, we found variation across coaches, with one coach increasing the prevalence of directive moves across four planning conversations and another increasing the prevalence of reflective moves across four debriefing conversations. Although we focus on mathematics coaches, the findings and methodology may be applicable to other disciplines.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Exclusionary school discipline is one of the primary ways that schools address student behavior. Existing scholarship has focused on examining the implications of exclusionary school discipline for two sets of outcomes: academic achievement and future juvenile and criminal legal involvement. However, these two areas of scholarship are largely treated as separate. In this paper, we bridge these two research areas by drawing on scholarship examining the negative educational consequences of police contact for youth. Specifically, we formally test the proposition that the association between school suspension in childhood and adolescent academic achievement is mediated by police contact experienced in early adolescence. Using data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we find support for this hypothesis: Early adolescent police contact explains approximately 30% of the association between school suspension in childhood and adolescent GPA. By relying on exclusionary school discipline, our results suggest that schools are setting the stage for youth to become involved in the criminal legal system, which, in turn, hinders future academic achievement.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reports on the impacts of a nudge intervention designed to narrow the gender gap in technology education. I randomly assigned approximately 4,000 college freshmen to one of three advising interventions during new student orientation. Students in the treatment group received a brochure containing information about technology courses and were exposed to stereotypical imagery, neutral imagery, or counter-stereotypical imagery. Information provision had a positive impact on both technology course take-up and technology major selection. A stronger response by men led to an overall increase in the gender gap, but this gap is smallest among students exposed to counter-stereotypical imagery.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper presents evidence of the effects of dual language immersion (DLI) programs on the academic outcomes of students in elementary grades. Leveraging enrollment lotteries from four cohorts of DLI applicants across 10 oversubscribed programs, analyses estimate the intent-to-treat effect of access to bilingual education on reading and math test scores. On average, native English-speaking students in Grades 1 through 4 who win access to a DLI program score higher in reading and math by 0.12 and 0.14 SDs, respectively. The achievement gains in test scores are realized as early as first grade.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We use a novel linkage of school district administrative data to Internal Revenue Service records to study educators’ post-exit career outcomes. The majority of leavers remain in education and mean earnings are slightly below pre-exit earnings even 8 years later. However, these average changes conceal wide variation in outcomes. Roughly 20% of leavers are unemployed, and the bottom quartile of employed leavers earn less than $20,000 annually. At the same time, earnings among the top quartile of employed leavers are higher than those of nearly all stayers, sometimes exceeding $100,000. Post-exit employment and earnings declines are associated with the presence of children or a high-earning spouse for voluntary female leavers, suggesting a role for family-conscious policies for teacher retention.

          Abstract
                  <p>Using teaching representations is one of the common means for preparing pre-service mathematics teachers (PSTs) to learn how to teach mathematics meaningfully. However, turning PSTs’ attention to the mathematical objects that students engage with during the lesson is a challenging pursuit. This paper suggests using the Realization Tree Mediator (RTM) as a visual teaching representation for PST learning to implement cognitively demanding tasks in their classrooms. The RTM depicts the mathematical object at the core of a task and its different realizations while illustrating imaginary classroom discussions in which different realizations and the links between them are produced. By analyzing PSTs’ conversations around RTM images, we show how contrasting pairs of RTMs can be used for eliciting conversations about various aspects of cognitively demanding instruction. We discuss the affordances of the RTM as a teaching representation and how it can assist in making the mathematical content and meanings visible, public, and communicable among teachers and teacher educators.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>When individuals are released from prison, they typically enter a period of post confinement community supervision. While under community supervision, their behaviors are subject to special conditions requiring them to report to supervisors and prohibiting certain behaviors such as drug and alcohol use. Many supervisees are returned to prison because they violate those special conditions, or because they commit minor crimes that would not result in prison were they not being supervised. But others are returned to prison for serious new crimes. We distinguish the two as nuisance behaviors (the former) and pernicious behaviors (the latter). Our research applies competing events survival analysis to distinguish a structural model that accounts for nuisance behaviors from a structural model that accounts for pernicious behaviors. We demonstrate that returning offenders to prison for technical violations and minor crimes may reduce the incidence of major crimes because the occurrence of nuisance behaviors and pernicious behaviors are highly correlated. Our findings support the theory that nuisance behaviors signal the likelihood of pernicious behaviors.

                  <p>A theoretical model describing Grade 7 students’ rational number sense was formulated and validated empirically (n = 360), hypothesizing that rational number sense is a general construct consisting of three factors: basic rational number sense, arithmetic sense, and flexibility with rational numbers. Data analysis suggested that rational-number tasks can be categorized based on the validated model. The flexibility component reflects thinking about rational numbers in terms of noticing, using, and expressing relations and properties of numbers in patterns, functions, covariation, and complicated computational tasks. It includes utilizing number structure and relational understanding of operations and numbers. Analysis identified three categories of students that represent different rational-number sense profiles. Category 1 students exhibited a limited basic profile that solved mainly traditional school-based tasks. Category 2 students reflected the basic emergent arithmetic sense profile that responded adequately in operation tasks. Category 3 students represented the flexible emergent profile, as they manipulated underlying structures in a variety of situations, indicating an emergent fundamental shift from an arithmetic to an algebraic focus. A discriminant analysis showed that basic and flexible factors could discriminate students best between the three identified profiles of rational number sense.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This article aims to illustrate how the collective resolution of routine mathematical tasks can give rise to uncertainties, fostering and supporting a rich and authentic mathematical activity. While solving routine tasks may not typically be classified as problem-solving, the research presented in this paper shows that, at the collective level, their resolution can give rise to new mathematical tasks to solve in the classroom and generate authentic problem-solving activity. Grounded in the enaction theory of cognition (e.g. Maturana &amp; Varela in Shambhala, 1992), this research considers the class as a unit, as a collectivity, which brings forth a mathematical activity. In this article, examples derived from an experiment conducted in elementary-level mathematics classrooms are used to show the emergence of uncertainties, highlighting the mathematical potential resulting from the collective resolution of routine tasks. In conclusion, the article introduces the concept of collective mathematical problems.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This introduction provides an overview of the articles in the special issue. Drawing on Sylvia Wynter’s notion of disenchantment, the articles in this special issue interrogate power and inequity in education. They question the given assumptions of education policy and aim to reorient us toward justice and educational transformation, pushing back against claims of “neutrality” or educational projects that reinscribe harm.
