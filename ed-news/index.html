          Abstract
                  <p>Identifying mathematically gifted students is an important objective in mathematics education. To describe skills typical of these students, researchers pose problems in several mathematical domains whose solutions require using different mathematical capacities, such as visualization, generalization, proof, creativity, etc. This paper presents an analysis of the solutions to two problems by 75 students (aged 11–14), as part of the selection test for a workshop to stimulate mathematical talent. These problems require the use of the capacity for mathematical generalization of solution methods. We define a set of descriptors of such capacity, use them to analyze students’ solutions, and evaluate how well students with high capacity for generalization can be distinguished from average students. The results indicate that the two problems are suitable for identifying potential mathematically gifted students and several descriptors have high discriminatory power to identify students with high or low capacity for generalization.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.

          Abstract
                  <p>The development of professional digital competencies is an important condition for a meaningful integration of digital technologies in mathematics education. A widely used and empirically studied approach for the professional development of in-service teachers are teacher design teams, in which lessons are collaboratively planned, implemented and reflected. However, this approach has not yet been considered for the collaboration of pre-service and in-service teachers. Therefore, this article examines in a holistic case study mixed teacher design teams composed of pre-service and in-service teachers. A total of 23 interviews were conducted with pre-service and in-service teachers and analyzed by inductive development of categories using the method of qualitative content analysis. The case study shows among other things, that the different prerequisites of the participants can lead to a relatively clear division of roles within the collaboration, which turns out to be suitable for the professionalization of both pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this study, we examine the real-time decision-making processes of a teacher in a UK post-16 mathematics classroom focusing on the integration of student-centred teaching methods. The contribution of this study is a transdisciplinary theoretical discussion which links teachers’ actual classroom practices (often traditional and teacher centred) with their professed student-centred perspectives. Utilising Abductive Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, this research incorporates cognitive, social psychological, sociocultural theory and perspectives on affect in the context of in-the-moment decisions. Through co-construction, we identify distinct but overlapping agentic and ecological dimensions of decisions. Recognising that teachers’ spontaneous decisions in the classroom are shaped by both their agency and the social and physical ecology of the classroom, this study provides a structured approach to understanding how diverse disciplinary concepts are related, and paints a dynamic picture of the process of teacher decision-making. This is crucial for identifying both limitations and possibilities in teacher education and professional development.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to elicit middle school pre-service mathematics teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems. The study presents a portion of a larger design-based study involving teacher training sessions encompassing small-group discussions, writing realistic mathematics problems, and whole-group discussions. The audio records of the pre-service teachers’ discussions and their written artifacts were analyzed in three coding cycles. The findings indicated that the pre-service teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems comprised both in-school situations that students themselves could experience and real-life situations that mostly required occupational decisions such as optimization in engineering. Besides, pre-service teachers considered that realistic situations often involve multiple information and could be solved by multiple solution methods that might lead to multiple acceptable answers. This study highlighted the informative role of articulating pre-service mathematics teachers’ personal meanings of realistic mathematics problems in designing teacher education courses and further discussed such implications for mathematics teacher education.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Reforming instruction is challenging. In this comparative case study of 12 school districts, we investigated the dilemmas that emerged for system leaders as they engaged in system building for elementary science and the approaches leaders took in managing them. We found that system leaders’ efforts to manage their environments contributed to the preferential treatment of literacy and mathematics relative to science. Leaders managed this dilemma using three strategies: (a) integration of science with other subjects, (b) specialization of teachers, and (c) adopting curriculum materials. This study contributes to literature on dilemma management by showing that dilemmas in education system building are school-subject sensitive, emerge in relation to system building for other subjects, and are embedded in school and education systems’ structural/organizational arrangements.

          Abstract
                  <p>Despite the prominence of analogies in mathematics, little attention has been given to exploring students’ processes of analogical reasoning, and even less research exists on revealing how students might be empowered to independently and productively reason by analogy to establish new (to them) mathematics. I argue that the lack of a cohesive framework for interpreting students’ approaches to analogical reasoning in mathematics contributes to this issue. To address this, I introduce the Analogical Reasoning in Mathematics (ARM) framework. Constructed from an analysis of interviews with four abstract algebra students, ARM identifies several analogical activities that serve to analyze students’ analogical reasoning with a finer grain size than was previously possible with existing frameworks. Using this framework, I present an analysis of the students’ constructions of a ring-theoretic analogy to subgroup, thus revealing that even constructing simple analogies can elicit diverse pathways of analogical reasoning across students. Implications for further research related to analogies and analogical reasoning in mathematics education are discussed.</p>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Tuesday, 20. August 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Longitudinal processes are often associated with each other over time; therefore, it is important to investigate the associations among developmental processes and understand their joint development. The traditional latent growth curve model (LGCM) with a time-varying covariate (TVC) provides a method to estimate the TVC effect on a longitudinal outcome while modeling the outcome’s change. However, it does not allow the TVC to predict variations in the random growth coefficients. We propose decomposing the TVC into initial trait and temporal states using three methods to address this limitation. In each method, the baseline of the TVC is viewed as an initial trait, and the corresponding effects are obtained by regressing random intercepts and slopes on the baseline value. Temporal states are characterized as (a) interval-specific slopes, (b) interval-specific changes, or (c) changes from the baseline at each measurement occasion, depending on the method. We demonstrate our methods through simulations and real-world data analyses, assuming a linear–linear functional form for the longitudinal outcome. The results demonstrate that LGCMs with a decomposed TVC can provide unbiased and precise estimates with target confidence intervals. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for these methods with commonly used linear and nonlinear functions.

          Abstract
                  <p>In recent decades, there has been rapid development in digital technologies for automated assessment. Through enhanced possibilities in terms of algorithms, grading codes, adaptivity, and feedback, they are suitable for formative assessment. There is a need to develop computer-aided assessment (CAA) tasks that target higher-order mathematical skills to ensure a balanced assessment approach beyond basic procedural skills. To address this issue, research suggests the approach of asking students to generate examples. This study focuses on an example-generation task on polynomial function understanding, proposed to 205 first-year engineering students in Sweden and 111 first-year biotechnology students in Italy. Students were encouraged to collaborate in small groups, but individual elements within the tasks required each group member to provide individual answers. Students' responses kept in the CAA system were qualitatively analyzed to understand the effectiveness of the task in extending the students’ example space in diverse educational contexts. The findings indicate a difference in students’ example spaces when performing the task between the two educational contexts. The results suggest key strengths and possible improvements to the task design.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Writing-intensive and proof-based mathematics courses have a variety of unique course outcomes and challenges. As such, active learning in these courses may differ from what we traditionally expect to see in an “active” first-year calculus course: an interactive in-class activity can be replaced with an out-of-class reading and homework problem in a proof-based course. We argue that the latter is no less “active” and claim that reading and writing mathematics form the foundation of how students learn by doing in writing-intensive mathematics courses. In this commentary, we discuss our pedagogical approaches to supporting students’ learning in introductory mathematical writing courses and how we promote active engagement. We outline potential benefits and challenges of these teaching methods and assessment strategies and conclude with some questions for reflection.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Educators are in a time of change, as the emergence, availability, and growth of AI technology challenge long-standing assumptions about the purpose and pedagogies in higher education. In this commentary, I argue that service course designers and instructors have been facing similar dilemmas for over 30 years. I propose that educators can learn from the practices of service course coordinators, and that a service mindset — where we willingly place ourselves in the role of a servant to our students, colleagues, and other stakeholders — is one that we need if we are going to do big things in the face of the challenges ahead. I provide an illustration of the considerations that I made to serve multiple stakeholders as I designed one aspect of a very large, multisection calculus course, and how a service mindset helped to simplify my work.</p>

                  <p>This study investigates the impact of computational labs on students’ conceptual understanding of calculus in a one-semester Business Calculus course. The computational labs integrated Jupyter Notebook as the modeling tool. Using the Calculus Concept Inventory, quantitative analysis was performed to measure differences in conceptual knowledge between a control and experimental group based on whether the student engaged in computational labs compared to traditional classwork. Qualitative analysis was conducted to understand student perspectives about the value of participating in computational labs during the course. The qualitative data involved student reflections at the end of each lab experience. Although the quantitative analysis did not produce statistically significant results, the qualitative analysis revealed the students perceived the computational labs as beneficial regarding their understanding of the content and practical applications of the material. Notably, the students reported the labs offered a unique way to solve problems, allowed for connections to real-life mathematical situations, and helped to visualize calculus concepts. This paper describes the research project and offers practical applications of computational labs in Business Calculus courses, as well as suggestions for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The decisions that teachers make in transforming the curriculum into specific lesson plans determine the real enactment or otherwise of curricular ideals. These decisions are shaped by the resources available and by each teacher’s goals and orientations. This exploratory study employs Schoenfeld’s decision-making model to examine how resources, goals and orientations influence lesson planning for mathematics problem solving, for different profiles of primary teachers in Chile. To this purpose, a survey was conducted among 40 teachers of varying degrees of ability and experience: some were beginning teachers, others were experienced but had no further training in teaching problem solving and a third group was composed of experienced teachers with specific training in this question. Interviews with two teachers from each profile revealed important differences between the three groups. Beginning teachers relied more heavily on official resources such as the official curriculum and standard textbooks, aligning themselves with school requirements. Experienced teachers with problem solving training demonstrated a strong inclination towards teaching through a problem solving approach. While beginning teachers acknowledged the importance of promoting problem solving strategies, they did not usually adapt problems to the mathematical content or to the age/competence of their students. Interestingly, all three groups under-utilised sections of curricular resources that emphasise the present curricular focus on problem solving. Finally, the study found that experience alone is not enough to develop a problem solving approach and that focused professional development programmes are needed to equip teachers with the necessary skills. In addition, a diagnostic teaching approach should be incorporated into initial teacher training.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study contributes to Action, Process, Object, Schema (APOS) theory research by showing two approaches used by advanced mathematics students to construct relations between higher-order derivatives to solve complex problems. We show evidence of students’ ability to perform Actions on their graphing derivative Schema, that is, of its thematization. It also contributes to the literature on the learning of differential calculus by showing how advanced students use their knowledge to construct relations between concepts when facing complex situations. The work of three graduate students on transforming complex graphs and determining their properties and their relation to the domain structure is analyzed to determine their solution approaches. Their graphing derivative Schema is analyzed in depth in terms of the construction of relations among the Schema structures and assimilation and accommodation mechanisms involved in thematization in APOS theory. These findings are important in informing and developing didactic strategies to foster university students’ understanding of derivatives, which can smoothe the transition to the study of advanced mathematics courses.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Rough draft math [RDM] (Jansen, 2020a) occurs when a teacher invites students to share their in-progress thinking and provides opportunities for students to revise their thinking. RDM could be viewed as an approach to ambitious teaching because it is a practice when teachers elicit and respond to students’ thinking to support their learning, which is productive, and their positive identity development, which is powerful. The purpose of this study was to identify salient and feasible enactments of rough draft math, as described by teachers after they have learned about RDM through a book study and/or professional development. We interviewed 32 teachers in eight states in the USA, and we identified variations among the two most feasible and salient enactments of RDM: (1) inviting students to revise and (2) purposeful task selection and implementation. Variations in revising enactments included providing students with structured or unstructured revision opportunities and different ways teachers incorporated revising into their assessment practices (either test corrections or student self-assessment). Variations in task selection included modifying curricular tasks or using instructional routines intentionally. Variations in task implementation included implementing tasks to reinforce content or develop new understandings. We developed conjectures about the ways in which these variations could provide powerful or productive opportunities for students.</p>
