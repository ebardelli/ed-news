          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Over one billion people globally struggle with mental ill-health, including depression, and self-harm. Mental ill-health is prevalent in lower income nations, where lack of research in implementation and policy change is further impeded by stigma and fragmented service delivery. This British Academy funded project (ARCLIGHT) developed from a ‘pre-bid stage’ in partnership with key Guyanese stakeholders. The project was a participatory action research study (PAR) across three differing Guyanese communities. Its objective was to co-create a community-based mental health improvement programme. A key component included supporting participants recording their digital stories of successful practices using mobile phones linked to local Wi-Fi systems. The study contributed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of improving wellbeing and health, enhancing gender equality, and reducing social and economic inequalities and meeting the World Health Organisation’s strategic priorities for Guyana regarding mental health and violence. This interdisciplinary project considered the cultural, professional, and political barriers to mental health recovery, provided new conceptual understandings and policy-relevant evidence that addressed the global challenge of mental health, in multi-ethnic and resource-poor countries. Our collaborative approach, underpinned by PAR, encouraged behavioural change, economic independence, and enhanced local services provision.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Evolving or stagnant immigration laws and policies may distinctly shape the experiences of undocumented students by shifting access to rights or opportunities. I draw upon 30 interviews with college students in California to analyze how they encountered legal vulnerability. I argue that legal vulnerability can be dismissed, dormant, or deep-rooted, producing contrasting experiences. Inclusive state and institutional policies set the stage for some students to dismiss legal vulnerability and decouple vulnerability from their academic experiences. However, most encountered dormant legal vulnerability through awakened racist xenophobia following the 2016 presidential election and deep-rooted legal vulnerability via persistent uncertainty about their futures or worries over family. Distracted students lost focus, motivation, and study time, which impacted their classroom participation and overall academic performance. Yet, they attempted to improve their academic engagement with limited effectiveness. Altogether, I theorize the relationship between different types of legal vulnerability and undocumented students’ college experiences.

          Abstract
                  <p>Advancements in computing and statistical analyses have significantly transformed mathematics education, integrating it with data and computer science. As big data becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding its complexities, including its unique uncertainties, is crucial. This study explores the uncertainty that novice students can articulate during their initial engagement with big data, including both data preparation activities or data-ing as well as data analysis activities. Consistent with prior research on students’ engagement with small data, we offer a case study revealing that novices can also exhibit extreme views of uncertainty while engaging with big data. Contrary to the context of small data engagement, our analysis revealed different sources for these extreme views. The classification we used can offer means to identify students’ uncertainty views and support them in developing a more balanced, mature, perception of uncertainty. Moreover, the analysis underscores students’ inclination towards high-uncertainty articulations during their initial encounters with big data-ing activities.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>How scholars name different racial groups has powerful salience for understanding what researchers study. We explored how education researchers used racial terminology in recently published high-profile peer-reviewed studies. Our sample included 1,427 original empirical studies published in the nonreview AERA journals from 2009 to 2019. We found that two thirds of articles used at least one racial category term, with an increase from about half to almost three quarters of published studies between 2009 and 2019. Other trends include the increasing popularity of the term Black, the emergence of gender-expansive terms such as Latinx, the popularity of the term Hispanic in quantitative studies, and the paucity of studies with terms connoting missing race data or including terms describing Indigenous and multiracial peoples.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study uses experimental and nationally representative Head Start Impact Study data to document the high incidence of multidomain household instability experienced by children eligible for the federal two-generation Head Start early childhood education program for low-income households. The study finds that household instability experienced during the preschool year is associated with higher levels of children’s classroom inattentive/hyperactive, aggressive, and oppositional externalizing behavior problems at the end of kindergarten. This relationship is reduced and even eliminated by access to Head Start. Exploratory evidence suggests that Head Start’s buffering effect may operate by reducing exposure to household instability—including the incidence of high levels of multidomain household instability and the use of parental care—as well as parent–child relationship conflict.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Beginning the path to a bachelor’s degree in community college has the potential to be a more cost-effective higher education option. Previous research on transfer students has focused broadly on curriculum alignment, articulation policies, and academic advising in efforts to reduce credit loss. Credit loss can significantly impact transfer students and result in unnecessary time and costs for them. Minimal research quantifies and visualizes credit loss or explains in detail how and why it occurs throughout students’ entire education trajectories. This study visualizes credit loss for bachelor’s programs seeking engineering transfer students who began at in-state community colleges using data from the sending and receiving institutions. Findings revealed that credit loss can occur throughout the entire degree pathway, including high school dual enrollment and advanced placement credits to community college credits. This work has implications for informing degree pathways and policies that promote successful transfer and degree completion.

          Abstract
                  <p>Data-ing, understood as the verb accompanying the noun data, can describe multiple competencies related to a proficient handling of data and its representations. Previous studies highlight the importance of developing a more holistic perspective on data for young learners as well as the consideration and fruitful integration of context knowledge and statistical information in order to strengthen competences involved while data-ing. Although both topics are well-researched individually, studies that jointly consider these aspects remain scarce. This study, therefore, reports on findings from an exploratory qualitative study of data-ing processes of 31 German third-grade students (age 9–10) and investigates the lenses on distributions that the young learners adopt as well as the purposes for which they leverage their context knowledge. Additionally, the study further characterizes the integration of the young learners’ context knowledge while data-ing with regards to the sources of said context knowledge. For analysis, the interviews were videotaped, transcribed and analyzed with qualitative content analysis methods. The exploratory study showed that our young learners predominantly use a classifier view to interpret the distributions of numerical data, often rely on their context knowledge more than on provided data, use their context knowledge mostly to justify a claim and mostly integrate their context knowledge on a local, ego-centric level in data-ing processes.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Dropping out of high school creates barriers to economic self-sufficiency. Career and technical education (CTE) may help students engage with school by showing the connection between school and work. Prior research has shown that high school CTE participation promotes positive academic outcomes including high school graduation. This paper uses a quasi-experimental design to examine the association between certifications and on-time high school graduation. Our findings indicate that certifications exert a meaningful influence on the likelihood of high school graduation, and that the effect is stronger for students who are at risk for dropping out or are economically disadvantaged.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Racially segregated schools influence the distribution of educational opportunity. When students of different races enroll in separate schools, systematic differences in access to school resources and exposure to high levels of student need can emerge. Using recently available national school-level finance data, we find that typical Black and Hispanic students attend schools with higher per-pupil spending but also higher proportions of low-income students and English learners than typical White students living in the same metropolitan area. Drawing on estimates of the additional spending required to provide high-need students with equal educational opportunities, we find that cost-adjusted spending in the average Black and Hispanic students’ schools ranges from zero to 17.2% less than that in the average White students’ schools. Racial disparities in cost-adjusted spending are larger in the largest metropolitan areas and in the Northeast, indicating that many Black and Hispanic students are disadvantaged by these inequities.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rer'>Wednesday, 13. November 2024</a> | 
        
          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This preregistered meta-analysis investigated whether cultural values moderate the relations between students’ achievement orientations and their tendency to cheat. We identified 80 studies on the associations between performance/learning orientations and academic cheating in 27 countries with 40,867 participants. Performance orientation positively correlates with academic cheating (r = .09, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.13), and learning orientation negatively correlates with academic cheating (r = −.16, 95% CI = −0.20 to –0.13). Univariate meta-analysis, hierarchical meta-regression, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) revealed that cultural values at the country level significantly moderate the relations between achievement orientations and cheating. These findings suggested that cultural values play a significant role in influencing the relations between achievement orientations and academic cheating, and, thus, cheating prevention programs must consider culture to achieve optimal effects. Based on these findings, we propose a new model that integrates cultural values into the existing model of academic cheating decision-making.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Despite the growing popularity of computing bachelor’s programs, women remain vastly underrepresented in these fields. Using Social Cognitive Career Theory and intersectionality as guiding theories, this qualitative study explores how postsecondary institutions shape women’s experiences choosing and entering computing bachelor’s programs. Twenty-eight of 40 participants entered their institutions with plans to study computing, while 12 developed a new (or renewed) interest in computing as postsecondary students. Findings outline four postsecondary structures that shaped women’s entry into computing majors, including university-level admissions and participant perceptions of financial and cultural accessibility; academic college-level organization and admissions processes; institutional computing cultures, namely introductory course experiences and social environments; and major declaration policies. Findings also show how these structures differentially shaped participant experiences based on intersecting social identities. Overall, findings illustrate the precarious relationship between computing interest development, major intent, and major enrollment for undergraduate women in computing.

          Abstract
                  <p>Natural language is known to play a crucial and specific role for children’s learning in school mathematics. Not only does it carry special vocabulary, but subtle differences between natural languages may lead to surprising challenges, for instance, for learners who are not taught mathematics in their mother tongue. In this paper, the anthropological theory of didactic (ATD) is used as a main framework, and we analyse some praxeological anomalies from the teaching of fractions at Japanese schools abroad, while learners attend, at the same time, a regular school in some other language (in this case, the local language, Swedish). Our findings indicate that these praxeological anomalies arise not only from linguistic disparities related to specialised vocabulary and syntax for elementary mathematics but also from institutional and curricular differences. This study gives new insights on these language challenges related to mathematics as taught at expatriate schools, particularly in the case of Japanese.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Objective: This study tested a ‘wise’ intervention (quick prompt of a specific psychological mec) in acute care hospital units to improve nurses’ hand hygiene compliance (HHC). Design: A multiple baseline design in two medical-surgical teaching hospitals in the United States. Measurements: Hand hygiene data was collected using an electronic compliance monitoring system with sensors placed in doorways and on corresponding soap and alcohol-based hand rub dispensers. The outcome measure was the proportion of opportunities in which HH was undertaken by staff per week in each unit. Intervention: A quick-and-easy psychological prime to reinvigorate professional identity. Methods: Interrupted time series analysis using a quasi-Poisson regression model with statistical process control charts for each unit. Results: A statistically significant increase in HHC rates that was sustained for months post-intervention. However, the patterns by unit were not statistically significant once temporal trends were considered. Other factors, such as the unit type and the use of incentives could have impacted the results. Conclusions: These analyses suggest that the aggregate impact should not be taken as evidence of intervention effectiveness. This study therefore cannot be considered to have provided a strong foundation for use of a ‘wise’ intervention, despite its relatively small financial, logistical and psychological cost.
