          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are widely used, yet concerns have arisen about whether the evidence for these programs extends to students of color (SOC). The data in this study include published articles (n = 158) of trials (n = 97) of SEL interventions (n = 32) from the CASEL SELect list of evidence-based SEL programs. Using racial frames common in intervention research, we examined the extent of SOC representation in SEL intervention trials, how authors attend to race/ethnicity in their analyses, and whether and how these analyses show evidence that these programs benefit specific racial/ethnic groups. While doing so, we discuss the complex nature of race and racism in SEL research. Eight interventions provided some evidence that they benefit Black students and four showed some evidence that they benefit Hispanic/Latiné students. No trials provided evidence of benefit to any other groups of SOC. Findings suggest that while representation of SOC in SEL trials has improved, additional research is needed to understand to whom the evidence for SEL program effectiveness applies.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Social innovation (SI) is gaining attention to explore how multistakeholder initiatives create new social practices for local food system development. Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) is a group-based certification scheme for sustainable farming, comprising new social practices that require changes in relationships and roles. Research highlights potentials of PGS to produce SI; however, without providing insights into the innovation process, needed to learn how relationship and role building occur and how SI can be facilitated through action research. We addressed these gaps in a four-year action research that co-developed a PGS in Argentina. The overall aim of studying relationship and role building required to establish PGS was operationalized by i) analysing ambitions for change of relationships of involved groups; ii) examining how relationship building evolved and how it was facilitated; and iii) exploring changes in role understanding and performance. Therein, we reflected on how action research can enhance SI and transformation in local food system development. The processual analysis showed that SI was facilitated when narratives of change were shared across stakeholder environments and a socially constructed facilitation mandate was created. Critical role reflection was stimulated, while performance was constrained when individual benefits were uncertain, underscoring the need to elaborate on role expectations in the initiation phase.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research on teachers’ noticing of student mathematical thinking has typically focused on how a teacher attends to, interprets, and determines a response to an individual student contribution in isolation from the broader mathematical classroom context. This research focus is not nuanced enough, however, to fully account for the complex noticing required of a teacher engaged in responsive teaching. To support teachers in enacting responsive teaching, it is important to have a way to distinguish high-leverage student contributions from among the many contributions available to a teacher. We draw on a previously developed framework to help teachers identify such contributions, those referred to as a mathematically significant pedagogical opportunity to build on student thinking (MOST) (Leatham in Journal for Research in Mathematics Education 46:88–124, 2015). We conceptualized a productive response to a MOST—what we call building on a MOST—that involves the teacher using a coordinated combination of moves to engage the class in collaboratively developing a sense-making argument about the significant mathematics inherent in the MOST. Rather than a single act of noticing, building requires the teacher to engage in an iterative, dynamic, and relational noticing process as students contribute their ideas to the sense-making discussion. It is this ongoing noticing that allows the teacher to keep the discussion focused on making sense of the MOST. In this article, we use this responsive teaching practice and the iterative noticing it entails to unpack a nuance of teacher noticing—what we call noticing with respect to.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this theoretical article, we propose a conceptualisation of noticing, drawing on our enactivist perspective, which takes account of what is now known about human cognition, and from which we draw out implications for how noticing develops. We review past work on mathematics teacher noticing and note the dominance of a paradigm of taking noticing to comprise: attending, interpreting, and deciding. We argue this framework draws from a computing model of mind, which is outdated. We use a vignette, from a lesson and stimulated recall interview, to elaborate an alternative. We suggest that noticing is: embodied; layered; mutual; and meta. We then further exemplify these characteristics by showing how they can be used to analyse a vignette from a teacher discussion of a video recording (of the first vignette). From these ideas, we then consider how it is possible to educate teacher noticing, and how it can develop through a focus on critical events.</p>

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>To effectively teach modeling, instructors need to select tasks that allow students to learn which mathematical operations are appropriate for modeling different scenarios. Naturally, instructors might select tasks using a priori task classification systems—ones that group real-world problems for a given operation based on mathematical formalisms (e.g., as reported by Vergnaud (in: Hiebert (ed) Number concepts and operations in the middle grades, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1988). In this paper, we critique the robustness of a priori task classifications systems for guiding the selection of modeling tasks. We investigated the meanings undergraduate STEM majors attributed to multiplication while modeling a predator–prey system using differential equations. Through analysis of task-based clinical interviews with 23 participants, six distinct justifications for why multiplication was an appropriate operation for modeling the scenario were identified. These six justifications confirm that learners’ assimilation of scenarios to operations may differ from how educators classify problems using a priori classification schemes. Our findings challenge the use of a priori task classification systems for guiding the pedagogical selection of real-world scenarios to model because classifying real-world scenarios using a priori systems can overlook nuances in modelers’ structuring and validating. We highlight the importance of these nuances for generating task trajectories that would leverage learners existing meanings for mathematical operations to build new associations between mathematical operations and novel problems. We end by suggesting a shift towards reasoning-based classification systems for selecting real-world scenarios to model—ones that are based on students reasoning about and within a scenario.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Traditionally, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been introduced and socialized to a cartoon of three children attempting to watch a baseball game as the prevailing definition of equity. Yet, in our sociopolitical context where Black, Brown, and LGBTQ+ children are continuously marginalized, we critique whether this simple construction of equity is sufficient. Rather, we build upon these understandings by outlining tenets of critical humanism and exploring the degree to which PSTs fluctuate between technical and humanist conceptualizations in their definitions of equal and equitable instruction. In this large-scale qualitative study using data collected between 2022 and 2024, we analyzed 1,528 PST responses about their conceptualizations of equity and equality. We found that PSTs harbor various conceptualizations of equity that are robust around resource-based teaching attributes such as materials, instruction, and accommodations. However, PSTs presented paradoxical understandings of equity related to treatment and opportunities, revealing tensions between technical and humanizing approaches to education.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>College policies may support intentional cross-cultural interactions among peers. This study examines the impact of having an international roommate on the college outcomes of domestic U.S. students. Using institutional data on more than 6,600 U.S. students from a selective liberal arts college that serves low-income individuals, our analysis demonstrates the positive effects of being paired with an international roommate on U.S. students’ first-year GPA, subsequent GPAs, and second-year retention. However, our findings show no significant effects on graduation rates or retention rates beyond the second year. These findings point to the potential benefits of deliberate organizational and institutional policies to facilitate interactions among individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Education has long been an area of political debate in the United States, with politicians and policymakers advocating for distinct societal and/or individual purposes of K–12 education. In this article, we examine the public opinion on the purpose of education, and we explore whether this political divide on the purpose of education is also represented in the broad public opinion. For a sample 19,032 U.S. respondents, we test whether citizens’ partisanship corresponds with their opinions on seven educational purposes. We observe that the public opinion represents a multifunctional view on education and that some but rather small differences relate to partisanship. We frame these findings in the existing literature and postulate avenues for further research.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>We know surprisingly little about returns to experience among new teachers working with very young children, ages 2 to 5 years. This study begins to fill that gap using data on early care and education teachers working in all publicly funded, center-based settings in one state to document the relationship between teacher experience and an observational measure of teacher–child interaction quality. We used both cross-sectional data—similar to the data used in prior small studies—and longitudinal data that allowed us to track the improvement trajectories of individual teachers over a 3-year period. Our findings show considerable improvements over a 3-year period, particularly among new teachers (0.67 SD). Our longitudinal analysis also showed that, although teachers in childcare centers and Head Start began their careers with lower scores than teachers working in school-based pre-K programs, they demonstrated steeper growth trajectories.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Since 2020, legislators across the country have introduced bills aimed at banning instruction of Critical Race Theory in universities. This qualitative study examined 53 bills, most of which contained lists of “divisive concepts” that professors were prohibited from discussing in their classrooms. In addition, I analyzed 26 statements made by supporters of the bills that provided justification for the anti-CRT bans. The data exposed four Discourse Models upheld by these bills and their supporting statements using critical discourse analysis, tools developed by Gee, and legal analysis. The Discourse Models included Neoliberalism, Extreme Nationalism, Colorblindness, and Law as Morality.

          Abstract
                  <p>Examples play a variety of roles in proving and disproving. Buchbinder and Zaslavsky (2019) have produced an a priori mathematical framework for assessing students’ understanding of the role of examples when proving and disproving universal and existential statements. In this paper, I highlight three important aspects that suggest an extension of Buchbinder and Zaslavsky’s framework. These aspects arose a posteriori from research that had a focus on developing mathematically aligned assumptions related to proof and proving. To better approach students’ understanding of the role of examples in proving and disproving, these three aspects need to be explicitly included in the framework: (1) the size of the domain where universal and existential statements are defined, (2) the different forms of expression in which universal and existential statements can be presented, and (3) the quality of universal and existential statements. Illustrations of the development of in-service primary school teachers’ assumptions are given to show the emergence of these aspects and to support the extension of the existing framework.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Functional thinking has long been recognized as a crucial entry point into algebraic thinking in elementary school. This mixed-method study investigates the learning progression for elementary students’ functional thinking within the context of routine classroom instruction. Drawing on the existing research, a theoretical framework was constructed to assess the functional thinking of 649 students across grades 3 to 6. The framework includes three modes of functional thinking: recursive patterning, covariational thinking, and correspondence relations, each with particular and general layers of algebraic generality. Psychometric analysis was conducted to validate the assessment instrument. The study identifies a five-level learning progression of functional thinking: Pre-Structure, Pre-Functional Thinking, Emergent Functional Thinking, Specific Functional Thinking, and Condensed Functional Thinking. The distinctive characteristics of each level are identified and illustrated. Furthermore, the developmental sequence of different functional thinking modes within this learning progression is analyzed. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are examined.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we are interested in a dynamic vision of diagrams, focusing on their evocative power, their force in mathematical activity and their potential for interaction with mathematical objects. We are inspired by the work of C. S. Pierce to see diagrams as inscriptions that organise space and articulate relations and that of the philosopher of mathematics G. Châtelet that emphasises diagrams as the very means of ontogenesis. In particular, diagrams are sophisticated mathematical devices for thinking about and communicating mathematics. They have stories and purposes. Focus is on the use of diagrams in the mathematics classroom to tell stories in order to trigger narrative modes of thinking (a là Bruner) as part of the mathematical work. Through some examples from the written productions of students at different ages, we examine how the task of telling a story about a given diagram gives rise to multiple views of the diagram. We use this analysis to begin characterising ways in which the mathematical relationships embedded in a diagram acquire a character that is both affective and aesthetic and to suggest implications of such use of diagrams in and for mathematics education.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We study the impact of a bonus policy in Hawai‘i Public Schools that raised the salaries of all special education teachers by $10,000. We estimate that this policy reduced the proportion of vacant special education teaching positions relative to general education positions by 32% and the proportion of special education positions that were vacant or filled by an unlicensed teacher by 35%. These impacts were largest in historically hard-to-staff schools in which all teachers received additional bonuses. The policy did not have significant effects on special education teacher retention; instead, the impacts of the policy were driven almost entirely by an increase in the number of general education teachers in the state who moved into open special education teaching positions.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective df as proposed by Satterthwaite, specifically addressing scenarios where component df are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large df, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite’s framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson and Rust, as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants. Finally, the proposed adjustment also provides a correction to the estimate of the total variance in cases missing data have been replaced by multiple imputations such as in the case of plausible values in national and international large scale assessments.
