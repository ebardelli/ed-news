          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The frequency and richness of the theories developed, tested, and used by researchers in an academic discipline exemplify several pertinent factors, namely, the growth, the maturity, the independence, the legitimacy, and the influence of the discipline. Although organizations have been working on projects for centuries, Project Management (PM) is a considerably new academic discipline with emerging research themes, models, methodologies, frameworks, and paradigms. These PM concepts are anchored on or reinforced by new or existing theories. This exploratory study aims to add to the existing PM body of knowledge by investigating the prevalence of theory use in PM research. A systematic content analysis of 9200 PM research articles published from 2000 to 2019 (20 years) in the leading PM journals identified 248 unique theories. These results reveal that the PM discipline is increasingly embracing the use of theories with game theory, fuzzy theory, agency theory, contingency theory, and stakeholder theory emerging as the most dominant theories in the reviewed research articles. Also, although PM is developing its theories, the results revealed that PM researchers continue to heavily use theories borrowed from other academic disciplines such as psychology, sociology, mathematics, and economics.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research on Mathematics Teacher Educators (MTEs) is crucial for enhancing the professional development of prospective mathematics teachers. However, there is a dearth of recent studies focusing on MTEs’ preparedness for technology integration, particularly within the Zambian educational context, and the wider Sub-Saharan African region. This study assessed the readiness of MTEs in Zambia to effectively integrate digital technology into mathematics education, examining their perceived technological proficiency and familiarity, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. Using a predominantly quantitative cross sectional research design, responses were gathered from 104 MTEs across 16 colleges of education and 12 universities in Zambia through an online semi-structured questionnaire. The findings revealed that, on average, MTEs exhibited low to moderate familiarity with various mathematics-related software applications, e-learning management systems, and web-based video conferencing tools. Although technological proficiency and perceived ease of use were somewhat lacking, MTEs demonstrated awareness of the value of digital technology and expressed willingness to ensure that preservice mathematics teachers acquire the necessary information and skills for technology integration in mathematics teaching and learning. Furthermore, willingness to use technology in the classroom was significantly predicted by perceived usefulness of, and proficiency with, various digital tools. The study also revealed that individuals tend to perceive technology as easier to use as they become more technologically proficient. In light of these findings, it is suggested that access to technological support not only enhances MTEs’ perception of technology’s ease of use but also positively influences their inclination to incorporate it into instructional strategies.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Special tasks for pre-service teachers (PSTs) in university mathematics courses (“interface tasks”) are a common innovation in recent years to overcome the second discontinuity. By this, we mean tasks that are situated by typical everyday challenges of mathematics teaching and in which PSTs must use their mathematical knowledge and skills in a professionally relevant way. In this paper, we analyze answers that PSTs have created to an interface task on symmetry. The PSTs were asked to clarify a student’s question from a mathematical perspective and then give a suitable elementarized answer. We situate these two steps theoretically and reconstruct the mathematical reasoning in PSTs' answers. Through qualitative content analysis, we examined how PSTs justify figures' symmetries from a university mathematics perspective and when responding to the fictitious student. The scenario of a student questioning the existence of 100° rotationally symmetrical figures elicited rich and varied responses, proving suitable for an interface task. We compared PSTs' reasoning related to mathematical clarification with the reasoning related to elementarization. In many cases, this revealed a productive use of course content. An interesting result is that there is no uniform picture as to whether the arguments are more detailed in the mathematical clarification or in the elementarization.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this study, a research team made up of Métis artists and knowledge keepers, Anishinaabe and non-Indigenous educators, and a non-Indigenous university mathematics education researcher co-designed and delivered an Indigenous cultural mathematical inquiry in a Grade 5 classroom. We explored the connections between loom bead designs and computational thinking of students using the LYNX coding platform to create and refine bracelet designs. Results indicate this investigation supported the development of (1) incremental and iterative approaches to coding, (2) testing and debugging, (3) reusing and remixing code, and (4) abstracting and modularizing. More importantly, students gained an appreciation of Métis culture and the importance of experiencing multiple cultural perspectives when learning mathematics.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study examines the impact of an online math learning program on third through fifth grade math achievement in Louisiana. Employing Zearn Math usage metrics and administrative data from the Louisiana Department of Education, the results indicate that grade levels that programmatically used Zearn Math scored, on average, about .03 standard deviation units higher on Louisiana’s statewide math assessment. A placebo test using English-language arts scores and several robustness checks suggests that this may be an underestimate of the true effect. These findings come at a crucial time because pandemic-related school closures have led to a 20-fold increase in public school spending on Zearn-related materials between July 2019 and July 2021, and its presence continues to expand across the nation.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 8-14, September 2024. <br>Adults’ beliefs and knowledge about the state of the U.S. education system drive decisions about policy, funding, program adoption, student participation in programs, and the selection of decision makers to elected positions. Amie Rapaport and Anna Rosefsky Saavedra share national survey data showing that U.S. adults have little knowledge about what is being taught in schools, express neutrality about belief systems undergirding education policy, and report experiences misaligned with hard-data trends on student academic progress in recent years. With adults reporting they learn about issues crucial to our education system mainly from “personal experience,” better information has the potential to improve U.S. education.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 52-53, September 2024. <br>The current culture wars have been showing up in schools and districts, making local school board races increasingly partisan. The 2024 presidential race is placing even more attention on the partisan divide in local education policies and decisions. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins writes that education advocates can leverage this focus and help put aside partisan politics and meet the post-pandemic challenges students face.

As such, the WIDA Consortium has evolved its guidelines to deepen teachers’ conceptual understanding of language in their content areas, and thus, enable them to provide more effective instruction to multilingual learners. Karen L. Terrell explores one of the primary “key language uses” in mathematics — the narrative genre. She also considers how visuals can be powerful scaffolds and means of expression for multilingual learners and discusses how visuals can be used for students to both receive and express knowledge. The use of narrative and visuals can make mathematics more accessible to all students.
