          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>As a high-energy-consuming sector, China’s light sector should have received more attention for its carbon emissions (CO2e). However, the literature on energy-related CO2e in China’s light sector is limited at present. This paper aims to assess the impact of China’s light sector on CO2e. This paper applies the energy consumption technique, input-output analysis technique, and structural decomposition model to analyze China’s light sector energy-related CO2e and emission reduction from the input-output perspective. The results show that the energy structure effect, energy intensity effect, and input structure effect are the main restraining factors for the growth of the light sector energy-related CO2e, which are caused by the expansion of the energy utilization structure on the supply side of the light sector. The final demand effect is the factor promoting the growth of the light sector energy-related CO2e. It reveals that the final demand products in the light sector still have high environmental degradation features. Policymakers should actively enhance and rationally adjust the demand for the light sector in numerous industries to avoid the resource waste caused by the excessive expansion of the light sector.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Texas reduced new teacher preparation requirements in 2001 to allow more alternate paths to licensure. Within 5 years, this policy change resulted in more than half of the state’s new teachers being alternatively licensed. Using a series of first difference models, this study examines the relationship between the increased supply of new teachers in Texas and new teacher salaries prior to the policy change and in the 15 years thereafter. We find that the policy change did increase the supply of new teachers via alternative licensing, but pay for new EC-6 teachers declined by 2%–13% with differential effects based on the rate at which districts hired alternatively licensed teachers.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Climbing the ladder of institutional prestige is often promoted by leaders and policymakers in higher education, but there may be trade-offs associated with striving for status. This study examines the impact of Texas’s National Research University Fund (NRUF), which uses financial incentives to support institutions’ pursuit of prestige, on the salaries and employment of faculty. For full professors, the NRUF had a positive effect on the salaries of both men and women, but the policy also contributed to widening the gender gap in salary. In regard to employment, the NRUF had a negative impact on the share of women among full professors. The findings suggest that organizational pursuit of prestige may have unintended consequences for faculty gender equity.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This comparative case study explores how 18 state education agencies (SEAs) support school districts in advancing standards-based elementary science reform. We identify how SEAs understand their work in advancing elementary science reform and describe how SEAs sought to engage districts in bridging from standards to classroom practice. Based on our analysis, we argue that the school subject is a critical explanatory variable in understanding SEA efforts to support standards implementation and SEAs lean on a resource-based approach for instructional policy implementation. This study contributes to the growing research base on the role of state policy in supporting standards implementation.

      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Friday, 24. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Given that a national superintendent dataset has never existed, claims about superintendent turnover and gender gaps have traditionally been based on conjecture or data from a single year and small sample of superintendents. Utilizing a new dataset of all K–12 public school district superintendents in the United States across four school years, this study explores how the superintendent gender gap and turnover have changed over time and across states and district types. Analyses reveal that superintendent turnover has increased, particularly among men, and the superintendent gender gap has marginally narrowed. Although men are increasingly turning over, women are seldom filling those positions—a necessity if the superintendent gender gap is to narrow. State and district analyses are presented, as well as discussion of the implications of the findings and the power of a longitudinal superintendent dataset.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>These remarks, which were given as the 2022 Recipient of the Peter H. Rossi Award for Contributions to the Theory or Practice of Program Evaluation, emphasize ways to increase the impact of program evaluation. First, is the importance of asking good questions, including ones that challenge the assumptions and models that dominate the field. Relatedly, we need to question the assumption that “one size fits all” and recognize the variation that exists—across contexts, time, and individuals. The key question is what works for whom under what conditions, and this also pushes us to think about why effects differ and what is driving those differences, that is, the underlying mechanisms. It is also important to incorporate new perspectives to improve our questions, models, research design, and interpretation, thus helping to address the aforementioned points. We should both welcome diverse perspectives into the research community and listen carefully to the communities we seek to study and incorporating their insights. Although the examples focus on a career in education research, the implications of the points are relevant for any aspect of social policy.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Thursday, 23. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical modelling emphasizes the connection between mathematics and reality — still, tasks are often exclusively introduced inside the classroom. The paper examines the potential of different task settings for mathematical modelling with real objects: outdoors at the real object itself, with photographs and with a 3D model representation. It is the aim of the study to analyze how far the mathematical modelling steps of students solving the tasks differ in comparison to the settings and representations. In a qualitative study, 19 lower secondary school students worked on tasks of all three settings in a Latin square design. Their working processes in the settings are compared with a special focus on the modelling steps Simplifying and Structuring, as well as Mathematizing. The analysis by means of activity diagrams and a qualitative content analysis shows that both steps are particularly relevant when students work with real objects — independent from the three settings. Still, differences in the actual activities could be observed in the students’ discussion on the appropriateness of a model and in dealing with inaccuracies at the real object. In addition, the process of data collection shows different procedures depending on the setting which presents each of them as an enrichment for the acquisition of modelling skills.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Thursday, 23. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Fermi problems are real-context estimation tasks that are suitable for introducing open-ended problems in primary school education. To ensure their effective introduction in the classroom, teachers must have adequate proficiency to deal with them. One of the key aspects of problem-solving proficiency is flexibility, but there are few studies on flexibility in solving real-context problems. This study, based on an analysis of the errors made by 224 prospective teachers when solving a Fermi problem sequence, establishes performance levels. In addition, we define levels of flexibility in using multiple solutions across the sequence, which allows us to address the main objective: to study the relationship between performance and flexibility. We found that there are significant relationships between flexibility levels and the number and severity of errors made. Encouraging flexibility in prospective teachers may be an efficient way to improve their performance in solving real-context problems.</p>

        <a href='https://www.springer.com/education+%26+language/mathematics+education/journal/40753'>Thursday, 23. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>
      This paper presents methodology aimed at developing a rich understanding of the interplay of mathematical progress in the different social settings in which learning in inquiry-oriented classrooms occurs: individually; in small groups; and as a whole class. For this purpose, we enhance a theoretical-methodological approach of coordinating Documenting Collective Activity and the Recognizing-Building-Constructing model of Abstraction in Context that have been developed in earlier studies. We do this using an intact lesson on the area and perimeter of the Sierpiński triangle in a mathematics education master’s level course on Chaos and Fractals. The enhancement of the methodology allows integrating Collective and Individual Mathematical Progress (CIMP) by Layering the Explanations (LE) provided by the two approaches, and thus exhibits the complexity of learning processes in inquiry-oriented classrooms.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Although writing is often used for personal reflection in teacher education, it is less commonly leveraged to imagine educational futures (Gilligan, 2020)—particularly those centered on collective liberation. Amid intersecting social crises, however, imagining futures is critically important (Ladson-Billings, 2021), and writing is a crucial step toward bringing them into the present. In this participatory case study (Reilly, 2010), we explored the future-oriented writing practices of five early childhood teachers in an inquiry group. Drawing on critical literacy (Vasquez et al., 2019) and prolepsis (Cole, 1993), we describe how collaborative, creative, and pedagogical writing supported them in envisioning, enacting, and leading liberatory literacy pedagogies within and beyond their schools. Findings contribute to literature in teacher education, early childhood education, and literacy.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: California Proposition 56 increased the state tobacco tax by $2 per cigarette pack effective April 1, 2017. Between 2015-2020 San Francisco (SF) and some cities in Alameda County enacted local flavored tobacco sales restrictions. SF also increased its Cigarette Litter Abatement Fee, from $0.20/pack in 2015 to $1.00 in 2020.Objectives: Compare the change in tobacco prices before (2015) and after (2019/20) the implementation of a $2 increase in tobacco excise tax and local flavored tobacco policies in SF and Alameda Counties.Research Design: Descriptive study of the pre-to-post policy analysis design. We drew a proportional random sample of retailers (N=463) in SF and Alameda Counties, by city. Using multivariable, single- and multiple-level linear regressions, we compared inflation-adjusted average tobacco prices in 2015 vs. 2019/20 by county and by flavor policy, accounting for socio-demographics.Measures: Change in inflation-adjusted average tobacco prices in 2015 vs. 2019/20 by county and flavor policy, accounting for socio-demographics.Results: Between 2015-2019/20, the increase in cigarette prices was higher than the $2 tax increase, and higher in SF than Alameda County (+$4.6 vs +$2.5). SF retailers stopped selling Newport menthol cigarettes and Blu brand menthol e-cigarettes in 2019/20. Adjusted average cigarette prices increased significantly more in SF and Alameda County cities with comprehensive or partial flavor policies versus cities without flavor policies (by $3.23 and $2.11).Conclusions: Local flavor policies affected menthol product availability and may have had positive spillover effects and indirectly increased pack prices.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The ascendance of White Christian nationalism has profound implications for democracy and public institutions in the United States, including public education. This article explains the core beliefs and features of White Christian nationalism as a contemporary religiopolitical movement that seeks to fuse Christianity with civic life; delineates how and why it matters for educational research; and identifies how education scholars might begin to address White Christian nationalism, particularly by investigating how it can be unlearned. We argue that learning about White Christian nationalism can help educational stakeholders better understand current educational battles, such as banning books and discussion of critical race theory, and contextualize a wide range of pressing problems facing US education, especially problems involving educational justice and equity.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>To address the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress authorized the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF I) in March 2020 with over $6 billion allocated for emergency financial aid. In this paper, we utilize the administrative burden framework to analyze HEERF I implementation for a stratified random sample of colleges, focusing on the implications for equity. We find that disbursement policies varied along two dimensions: (1) whether they imposed burdens on students by requiring applications and proof of hardship and (2) whether they targeted needy students and varied the amount of aid according to need. When we examine sectoral differences, we find that private for-profit colleges were more likely to place higher burden on students, whereas public and minority-serving institutions were more likely to reduce burden.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Need for cognition is conceptualized as an individual’s intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activities. Over the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in how need for cognition impacts and correlates with learning performance. This meta-analysis summarized 136 independent effect sizes (N = 53,258) for the association between need for cognition and academic achievement and investigated the moderating effects of variables related to research context, methodology, and instrumentation. The overall effect size weighted by inverse variance and using a random effects model was found to be small, r = .20, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from .18 to .22. The association between need for cognition and learning performance was moderated by grade level, geographic region, exposure to intervention, and outcome measurement tool. The implications of these findings for practice and future research are discussed.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purposes of this study included conducting a meta-analysis and reviewing the study reporting quality of math interventions implemented in informal learning environments (e.g., the home) by children’s caregivers. This meta-analysis included 25 preschool to third-grade math interventions with 83 effect sizes that yielded a statistically significant summary effect (g = 0.26, 95% CI [0.07, 0.45) on children’s math achievement. Significant moderators of the treatment effect included the intensity of caregiver training and type of outcome measure. There were larger average effects for interventions with caregiver training that included follow-up support and for outcomes that were comprehensive early numeracy measures. Studies met 58.0% of reporting quality indicators, and analyses revealed that quality of reporting has improved in recent years. The results of this study offer several recommendations for researchers and practitioners, particularly given the growing evidence base of math interventions conducted in informal learning environments.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article I describe and reflect on my evolving undestandings of the study of mentoring since the publication of the 2005 article in the Journal of Teacher Education. My reflective journey suggests stressing two assertions to the study of mentoring. One, that there is a need to develop a more multidimensional and integrated conception of mentoring which draws on integrated models of mentoring and focuses on mentor-mentee/s dyadic and collaborative interactions as units of analyis and interpretation. Two, that we should go deeper into how mentors’ sense-making of being ‘lost or found in translation’ as agents of change operates within complex fields of interaction, at multiple policy, personal and interpersonal levels. Thus. a curriculum for learning to mentor should also include contents related to policy learning. I elaborate on these undestandings throughout the paper.
