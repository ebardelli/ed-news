          Abstract
                  <p>As increasing numbers of Black immigrant students attend schools in Chile, we examine classroom practices to consider the limits of the mathematics education equity promise for this student population. We focus on the practices of a third-grade teacher who participated in professional development for enhancing reform-based mathematics teaching in a racially diverse classroom. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s approach to race, our analysis shows how two technologies of race-power fabricate the Black immigrant child as an uneducable and impossible mathematics learner. We contend that rather than enhancing the inclusion of Black immigrant students, reform-based mathematics teaching might maintain and reinforce racial hierarchies of mathematics ability.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In-service primary school teachers’ professional development and, more specifically, their teacher agency, are analyzed regarding the integration of mathematical education and sustainability. To achieve this, based on semi-structured interviews, several questions involving Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and links between mathematics education and sustainability are considered, which yielded 44 answers. The analysis of these answers is based on four sub-aspects: knowledge of sustainability and its connection to the SDGs; sustainability practices; links between mathematics education and sustainability; and obstacles and challenges. The results show that teachers exhibit a significant lack of knowledge about sustainability and its connection to the SDGs, making a single association with issues related to the environmental crisis, which is the main focus of the sustainability practices carried out in schools. As pertains to the links between mathematics education and sustainability, most accept the importance of this connection, but point out various obstacles and challenges, such as the lack of knowledge and time, the curriculum itself, and others. It is concluded that it is necessary to design training programs focused on these aspects, in order to contribute to the development of teacher agency, i.e. the appropriation and reconstruction of new resources to face the challenges that mathematics education for sustainability implies in teaching practice.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Student absenteeism in the earliest years of elementary school has been linked to a range of negative outcomes. Though the literature has examined numerous factors that are associated with children missing school, the role of teachers—especially at the early elementary level—has not been well understood. Given that students spend the majority of their time in elementary school with one teacher in a single classroom, a large component of early elementary school is underexplored, and our understanding of absenteeism remains incomplete. In this vein, we looked into whether having novice versus more experienced teachers was linked to the frequency of student absenteeism in the earliest years of school. Using a national dataset including repeated observations of students in grades K-2, we found that novice teachers have students with fewer absences and a lower probability of being chronically absent. There were no differences in the outcomes of novice teachers as a function of child nor classroom characteristics. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Accountability efforts under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has brought greater attention to school-level processes and practices and their impact on student outcomes. This has pushed states to report more school-level inputs, including per-pupil expenditures. Grounded in an open systems theory (OST) framework, we identify the association between school-level per-pupil spending and academic growth on statewide assessments for seventh graders in Michigan. Overall, our findings suggest an overall positive association between school-level per-pupil expenditure and student growth.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Randomized experiments involving education interventions are typically implemented as cluster randomized trials, with schools serving as clusters. To design such a study, it is critical to understand the degree to which learning outcomes vary between versus within clusters (schools), specifically the intraclass correlation coefficient. It is also helpful to anticipate the benefits, in terms of statistical power, of collecting household data, testing students at baseline, or relying on administrative data on previous cohorts from the same school. We use data from multiple cluster-randomized trials in four Latin American countries to provide information on the intraclass correlations in early grade literacy outcomes. We also describe the proportion of variance explained by different types of covariates. These parameters will help future researchers conduct statistical power analysis, estimate the required sample size, and determine the necessity of collecting different types of baseline data such as child assessments, administrative data at the school level, or household surveys.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State-level postsecondary education governance has experienced a lull in successful reform efforts since the turn of the century. However, in 2020, the Utah System of Higher Education and Utah System of Technical Colleges were formally merged following a multi-year effort by state legislators and higher education officials. Framed by the theory of social construction and policy design, this study considers underlying institutional considerations and statewide goals that led to Utah’s governance merger and how these changes impacted the public higher education sectors in the state, offering insights for research examining higher education governance and reform efforts.

          Abstract  
                  <p>Recent literature underlines the increasing use of online platforms in learning undergraduate mathematics, where students refer to these as supplementary resources to develop their mathematical understanding. Through an intrinsic case study, we focus on a highly viewed YouTube learning resource for learning derivative. The selected case is from 3Blue1Brown, a YouTube channel whose founder has received an award from the American Mathematical Society. The video has garnered more than 3.3 million views in the past couple of years. Reflecting on the relevant literature, a realization tree for derivative is developed and then used as an analytical tool to analyze this resource to explore what realizations have been used in it to facilitate students’ understanding of derivative. The findings indicate that the analyzed YouTube resource discusses various realizations of derivative, including all its five main realizations, and effectively utilizes new digital technology for discussing these realizations. Such an exceptional resource for learning mathematics leads us to suggest that mathematics lecturers raise their awareness about such online free resources and incorporate them into their teaching packages when appropriate to facilitate student learning.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In university mathematics education, students do not simply learn mathematics but are shaped and shape themselves into someone new—mathematicians. In this study, we focus on the becoming of disabled mathematical subjects. We explore the importance of abilities in the processes of being and becoming in university mathematics. Our interest lies in how teaching and assessment practices provide students with ways to understand themselves as both able and disabled, as disabilities are only understood with respect to the norm. We analyse narratives of nine university students diagnosed with learning disabilities or mental health issues to investigate how their subjectivity is constituted in discourse. Our analysis shows how the students are shaped and shape themselves as disabled mathematicians in relation to speed in mathematical activities, disaffection in mathematics, individualism in performing mathematics, and measurability of performance. These findings cast light on the ableist underpinnings of the teaching and assessment practices in university mathematics education. We contend that mathematical ableism forms a watershed for belonging in mathematics learning practices, constituting rather narrow, “normal” ways of being “mathematically able”. We also discuss how our participants challenge and widen the idea of an “able” mathematics student. We pave the way for more inclusive futures of mathematics education by suggesting that rather than understanding the “dis” in disability negatively, the university mathematics education communities may use dis by disrupting order. Perhaps, we ask, if university mathematics fails to enable accessible learning experiences for students who care about mathematics, these practices should indeed be disrupted.</p>

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 7, Page 44-47, April 2024. <br>As educators have pushed for inclusion of all marginalized students of different identities, we’ve seen a backlash of political and parental indignation. Andy Hargreaves and Dennis Shirley suggest that while it’s sometimes clear who is right and who is wrong in these disputes, some issues aren’t so clear, and people’s multiple identities can come in conflict. They suggest that better representation, drawing upon our capacity for sympathy, not giving up on the power of learning, seeking out what serves the common good, and conducting disagreements with consideration for each other’s rights, are some of the best ways to define and defend the inclusive school and get through the storms of outrage and indignation.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 7, Page 48-51, April 2024. <br>Richard Allington reviews the nature of the reading achievement gap between students from low-income and high-income families, concluding that the limited access to children’s books experienced by children from low-income families lies at the base of the problem. The fact that children from low-income families lose reading achievement every summer largely explains summer reading loss. Allington and his colleagues completed two large-scale studies assessing the impact of giving free books of their choice to students from low-income families for them to read over the summer. After three years of summer books, the children gained almost a year in reading achievement compared to the students who did not receive books. The summer books project cost far less than a summer school program and produced greater achievement gains than having low-income children attend summer school programs.

As a principal, Kim Marshall found that mini-observations — short, frequent, unannounced classroom visits, each followed by a face-to-face coaching conversation and brief narrative summary — actually improved teaching and learning. With the benefit of hindsight, he shares ways mini-observations could be even more effective and shares some common observation practices he believes leaders should rethink.

Gloria McDaniel-Hall and Nina F.
