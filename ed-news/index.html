          Abstract
                  <p>This systematic review aims to provide a complementary to existing synopses of the state-of-the-art of mathematics education research on proof and proving in both school and university mathematics. As an organizing framework, we used Cohen et al.’s triadic conceptualization of instruction, which draws attention not only to the main actors of the didactical process (i.e., the Teacher and Students) and the Content around which the actors’ work is organized (herein, content related to proof and proving), but also to the relationships among the actors and the content. Out of the 103 papers we reviewed, almost half fell in the Student-Content category, which is consistent with the existence of a substantial number of frameworks, methods, and research findings related to students’ engagement with proof and proving. About a quarter of the papers fell in the Student–Teacher-Content category, which reflects an emphasis on viewing instructional practice in proof and proving in a holistic, systemic way. Only few papers fell in the categories that did not include Content in them, namely, the categories of Student, Teacher, and Student–Teacher; this suggests mathematics education research on proof and proving has a strong disciplinary identity, which potentially differentiates it from other mathematics education research strands. About a fifth of the papers were oriented towards ‘breaking ground’ through making an explicit theoretical and/or methodological contribution (Student–Teacher-Content and Content were the main categories where such contributions appeared), whilst the majority of the papers were focused on ‘building ground’ through elaborating or employing existing methodological and/or theoretical approaches.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper investigates how mathematics instructors' recognition of the professional obligations of mathematics teaching varies based on their institutional environment, specifically whether they teach high school or college mathematics. Using an instrument that measures instructors’ recognition of four hypothesized professional obligations, we surveyed 471 US high school mathematics teachers and 239 university mathematics instructors to measure the extent to which they recognized professional obligations when evaluating the appropriateness of certain instructional actions. After testing measurement invariance of four item sets, each of which measures one of the four hypothesized professional obligations—disciplinary, institutional, interpersonal, and individual obligations-, we compared the instructors’ recognition of each of the four obligations between the two groups. We found that university instructors recognized the institutional obligation more than high school teachers, while recognizing the individual and interpersonal obligations significantly less. This investigation provides insight into the variation in the nature of mathematics teaching practice across different levels of schooling.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Effective teaching and learning of Nature of Science (NOS) has been a curriculum goal for decades and its inclusion into the science education from K-12 is becoming commonplace worldwide, regardless of the differences in the adapted science curricula. However, less attention, if any, has been paid to the holistic representation of NOS at kindergarten schooling level. This study utilizes the Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) on NOS to investigate how NOS is represented in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) science curriculum documents for the kindergarten school years, and the extent of its alignment with the international benchmarks and educational research evidence. Findings from the FRA-based curriculum analysis have demonstrated that the standards include “the nature of science” as one of the key domains of science education in the kindergarten stage. However, the cognitive-epistemic dimensions of NOS appeared to be more dominant than the social-institutional system dimensions. Specifically, the majority of the standards and learning outcomes emphasize learning of scientific methods, scientific practices, and scientific knowledge, alongside very few NOS aspects related to scientific ethos, social values, professional practices, and social organization. Pedagogical and practical implications of these results for science education are presented, along with recommendations to help structure NOS account into the UAE science standards that is more progressive, holistic, and interactive, all which can be of interest to a broader audience for purposes of curriculum policy reform both locally and internationally.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Research alliances, like other research-practice partnerships (RPPs), aim to bridge the historic divide between educational research and practice and improve education in particular local contexts. Yet, although these demands reflect multiple and contested field-level logics, little prior research has examined the ways these logics impact the work of RPPs. This longitudinal, qualitative study explores the field-level logics that dominated the local contexts of two research alliances; how these logics shifted over time; and how research alliances responded to these shifts. Results show that field-level logics of research, practice, and community contended in both local contexts, and that alliance design, resources, and local contexts shaped research alliances’ efforts to respond to and manage shifting demands.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 40-45, September 2023. <br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, have ushered in a new digital era that presents formidable challenges related to cheating and plagiarism in the classroom. Although many school systems have reacted by banning AI language models and related applications, these technologies present opportunities to leverage formative assessment practices to enable students to demonstrate more complex and valued learning outcomes. Using the ICE (Ideas, Connections, Extensions) model, Louis Volante, Christopher DeLuca, and Don A. Klinger offer educators a research-informed pathway, based on best practices and policy, to promote critical, creative, and higher order thinking in secondary schools.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 46-50, September 2023. <br>In recent research with classroom teachers on their personal pedagogical trajectories, Jeremy Glazer found teachers expressing concerns that their teaching practice was getting worse and they were not able to do the best teaching they knew how to do. The accounts of these teachers suggest that, when thinking about strategies for improving teachers’ practice, education leaders need to expand their focus beyond the knowledge, skills, and experience of teachers themselves and begin to look at the contexts in which teachers do their jobs. Specifically, teacher development initiatives need to include advocacy for sustainable workloads and teacher autonomy.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 51-55, September 2023. <br>With all the talk of turnover and shortages, it would be easy to think that many teachers have simply given up on education. Yet, despite the myriad challenges teachers have faced recently, this is not the case: Teachers care about their work as much as ever. Andrew Pendola, David Marshall, Tim Pressley, and Deja Trammell present a new narrative suggesting that there is no shortage of teacher dedication, even if some are leaving. They provide strategic, school-level changes that can not only help keep our best teachers, but also enrich their core purpose and dedication.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 24-28, September 2023. <br>Pentucket Regional School District serves three small suburban communities north of Boston. Historically, its student performance had been quite high, but had been declining steadily for about a decade. The district had started reversing those losses, but the pandemic set it back. Now, however, the district has emerged even stronger; in most cases, student achievement already exceeds pre-pandemic levels. The reasons: new, high-quality curricula in multiple areas; a strong system of implementation supports; and a data-driven approach to help teachers address the specific needs of individual students. Assistant Superintendent Brent Conway explains how they did it.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 29-33, September 2023. <br>Integrating STEAM with human-centered design is one way to transform the teaching of high school mathematics. Susanna Kemp described how this was done at Evanston Township High School in Illinois through a project-based learning class called STEAM Design Thinking &amp; Innovation. The course equips students with real-world skills like critical thinking, creativity, communication, curiosity, collaboration, and empathy. Kemp describes the creation of the course as well as the design thinking process, shares how the course addresses critiques of design thinking, and encourages educators to develop curricula that focus on process over outcome and that de-emphasize competition.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 34-39, September 2023. <br>The 55th Annual PDK Poll finds that a wide majority (66%) of adults say teachers should have a substantial say in what’s taught in public schools, more than say so about school boards, local residents, or lawmakers. Support for teachers also is apparent in another result from the 2023 PDK Poll: 67% of respondents support increasing local teacher salaries by raising property taxes. That result reflects the public’s broad sense that public school teachers are undervalued, underpaid, and overworked. At the same time, more than half of Americans support shifting to a four-day school week in their community, nearly twice as many as said so two decades ago. And structurally, beyond a four-day week, the poll finds that about six in 10 adults support other changes in how schools operate — longer school days and/or a longer school year — as ways to try to improve student learning outcomes. On another topic, results show widespread support for schools conducting mental health assessments of students. The survey was produced by Langer Research Associates for PDK International, with data collected June 16-25, 2023, in English and Spanish, among a representative, random national sample of 1,002 adults.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 8-12, September 2023. <br>The 2023 National Teacher of the Year Rebecka Peterson is a high school math teacher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Union High School serves more than 3,000 students, 72% of whom qualify for free and reduced-price lunch, and 62 languages are represented. Peterson, an immigrant to the U.S. whose parents were medical missionaries, builds trust in her classroom through stories—her stories and those of her students. During her first year of teaching, she discovered the “One Good Thing” blog founded by math teachers. It encouraged teachers to post their own stories of good things that happened during the day. The practice of scanning her day for one good thing that had occurred changed her mindset, allowing her to see more good things and finally persuading her to be the “one good thing” for her students each day.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 1, Page 18-23, September 2023. <br>The Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards were adopted in the early 2010s in most U.S. states with high hopes of improving educational achievement and equity. Almost a decade later, there is little evidence of the hoped-for improvements at the state and national level. However, state and national averages obscure gains that occurred in particular schools and districts. Elaine Allensworth, Laura M. Desimone, and Latrice Marianno share findings from studies of successes in multiple states and in Chicago. Their research shows that improvement was most likely when teachers engage in professional learning that is both flexible and specific, incorporates collaboration, focuses on practice, and offers guidance in using resources.

Rose Sebastian shares the stories of two change-making teachers who taught at high schools where integration within the school stopped at the classroom doors. With perseverance, a strong sales pitch, and a willingness to compromise, both teachers were able to create new, more integrated courses at their schools. By looking closely at their paths to change, we can gain new insights into how bottom-up reforms are created and into how we can support more teachers in becoming change-makers.
