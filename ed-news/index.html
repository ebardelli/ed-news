          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Drawing on annual, nationally representative survey data from 2007–2022, I demonstrate that partisan gaps—the average differences in public opinion between Democrats and Republicans—have widened on many education issues. This pattern consistently exceeds what would be expected due to the changing demographic compositions of the parties alone. Widening partisan gaps are primarily attributable to sorting (alignment of one's party affiliation and one's issue positions) rather than polarization (increasing support for more extreme positions relative to more moderate positions). However, polarization is also increasing on some of the most divisive issues. Among those who are sorting, individuals are overwhelmingly switching their issue positions to align with their party affiliations rather than switching their party affiliations to align with their issue positions.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This longitudinal multi-case study explored four early career teachers’ attempts to differentiate instruction in schools that varied in their level of support for this pedagogical approach. It offered an in-depth examination of the experiences of novices who learned about the pedagogical tools of differentiation with depth and fidelity through the same preservice instruction, developed similar commitments to implementing them, and attempted to implement them in contrasting inservice settings. A large and rich data corpus collected across 4 years included participant interviews, observations of participants’ teaching practices, classroom artifacts, and interviews with participants’ mentors. Findings illustrated novices’ contrasting multi-year learning trajectories related to differentiation embedded within varied school settings. They also revealed the substantive role novices’ shifting visions of the enactment of practice played in appropriating differentiation’s pedagogical tools during their early careers. Recommendations for teacher educators who prepare teacher candidates to differentiate are provided.

          Abstract
                  <p>This article aims to connect two research areas by using positioning theory to review the literature on talk moves, teacher interactions, and discourse patterns in mathematics education. First, a conceptual review identified 44 articles with 94 concepts describing interactions and discourse patterns. Similar concepts were grouped in a process that developed five categories, each describing one teacher position (a teacher who tells, a teacher who supports, a teacher who uses students’ ideas to create learning, a teacher who orchestrates, and a teacher who participates). Related to each position, we describe rights, duties, and communication acts. We suggest that these five teacher positions represent three transcendent storylines (teachers are providers of insight, teachers are facilitators of learning, and teachers are participants in learning). Using positioning theory enables us to understand the underlying powers that shape the classroom in relation to transcendent storylines, rights, and duties. We use this to explore what the implications are of these storylines and positions for equity and access to important mathematical ideas. This article contributes to our understanding of the complexity of classroom interactions and how transcendent storylines might play a role in subverting or promoting particular classroom communication patterns.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This manuscript describes our effort to apply a novel approach to understanding student outcomes associated with a schoolwide antiracist intervention. We report a multimethod quantitative approach to evaluate a 10-week antiracist intervention designed and implemented by school staff by examining patterns of student intervention engagement and measures of key constructs that connect to antiracism, psychological well-being, and school connectedness. Our novel approach combines schoolwide surveys with smaller samples of daily diary participants, documenting variation in intervention engagement and examining postintervention outcomes. Our findings are limited by high attrition rates, small sample size, and data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, our methods offer a promising transferable approach to evaluate school-based antiracist interventions by examining patterns and predictors of intervention engagement, as well as daily fluctuations in student experience throughout the intervention period.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The out-of-school time (OST) field in the United States has a complex history. The push to offer programming reflects a legacy rooted in moral panics about racially minoritized youth. However, this field is populated by community spaces that act as multipurpose sites of culturally sustaining educational practices supporting positive youth development. We report findings from interviews with OST leaders, youth workers, policy influencers, and youth about how to create, sustain, and protect more liberatory and humanizing practices, demonstrating that racism and deficit-based thinking continue to inform programmatic practices and youth experiences. Furthermore, this study reveals that programs with expansive ideas of youth voice, healing justice, and whole-child approaches to youth development create better opportunities for connection and belonging.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Monday, 19. February 2024</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Education research commonly uses racial terminology but with little understanding of racial classification patterns across the field. In this study, we surface the use of racial terminology using a census of original research published in American Educational Research Association journals between 2009 and 2019. We do so as an ethical quantification exercise, seeking to further social justice goals by encouraging scholarship on racial terminology in education research. Using latent class analysis, we identify six classes of research ranging from about a third of articles that use almost no racial terminology to an eighth of articles that use terminology extensively. More recently published articles are more likely to be part of classes with extensive or narrow racial terminology usage and less likely to be in classes that are absent racial terminology. Qualitative research is more likely to use extensive racial terminology, and quantitative research is more likely to be absent of or narrowly use racial terminology. We conclude with recommendations for how future research can build off of these findings to address questions on how to authentically and purposefully use racial terminology in ways that reflect the complex ways people identify themselves to better situate education research to address racial inequality.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Public preschool boosts academic skills in kindergarten, but little is known about whether that boost lasts to third grade because many studies stop directly assessing children after kindergarten. The current study tests for sustained associations between preschool attendance and an array of repeatedly measured, directly assessed language and math skills; we do this separately for public pre-K and Head Start, the two major publicly funded preschool programs. We draw on a large, racially diverse sample of children from families with low incomes in Tulsa, OK (N = 689, Mage at 3rd = 8.5 years). Using propensity score weighting, we compare children who attended school-based pre-K or Head Start to those who did not attend preschool. Both school-based pre-K and Head Start attenders outperformed preschool nonattenders on numeracy in third grade. There was weaker evidence of a sustained preschool advantage on language and literacy skills, and no evidence that associations differed by preschool program.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Theories of reading comprehension have widely predicted a role for syntactic skills, or the ability to understand and manipulate the structure of a sentence. Yet, these theories are based primarily on English, leaving open the question of whether this remains true across typologically different languages such as English versus Chinese. There are substantial differences in the sentence structures of Chinese versus English, making the comparison of the two particularly interesting. We conducted a meta-analysis contrasting the relation between syntactic skills and reading comprehension in first language readers of English versus Chinese. We test the influence of languages as well as the influence of the grade and the metrics on the magnitude of this relation. We identified 59 studies published between 1986 and 2021, generating 234 effect sizes involving 15,212 participants from kindergarten to high school and above. The magnitude of effects was remarkably similar for studies of English (r = .54) and Chinese (r = .54) readers, with similarities at key developmental points and syntactic tasks. There was also some evidence of modulation by grade levels and the nature of syntactic tasks. These findings confirm theory-based predictions of the importance of syntactic skills to reading comprehension. Extending these predictions, demonstrating these effects for both English and Chinese suggests a universal influence of syntactic skills on reading comprehension.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Effective teaching pedagogies and curriculum frameworks in school physical education have been regularly changing and widely debated. However, teachers have predominately used technical and sport-based approaches, but tactical game-centered approaches (TGAs) are becoming more common when teaching games in physical education. This review systematically described the content and the quality of research that compared TGAs with other teaching approaches within school physical education. All 24 studies that were found compared a technical approach (TA) or control group with a TGA, and most originated from Western Europe. Studies were conducted equally in primary and secondary schools, most research was mixed-gender, and the majority incorporated a single sport to compare teaching approaches. The quality of reporting was mostly low with a moderate to serious risk of bias. Studies commonly showed that TGAs improved student outcomes in tactical skill; skill execution; affective, procedural knowledge and/or physical activity; and TAs improved skill execution and technical skill.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The linking of school choice and charter schools to the legacy of Black alternative education and civil rights initiatives is a central discursive galvanizing and organizing tool for charter proponents, as it aims to provide legitimacy to the charter movement, while simultaneously coopting Black critiques of the institution of education as a means to further neoliberal restructurings of the state. In this paper, I posit there exists a conceptual and political distinction between school choice and efforts of Black educational self-determination, an approach to challenge white dominance and supremacy. The paper engages in a historical analysis exploring the history of school choice and Black educational self-determination.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Using critical race theory (CRT) as both our theory and analytical framework, we interrogated vocational, career, and technical education (VCTE) policy as a racial instrument. We applied key CRT themes to examine both primary sources; including historical and contemporary VCTE Acts (e.g., Perkins I-V) and Congressional reports; and secondary sources, including academic analyses of VCTE, its history, and related legislation. Findings demonstrate that VCTE policy upholds race-neutrality, which we argue is problematic because without being designated a special population, racially oppressed students stand to miss out on important funding opportunities that could dramatically alter and improve their lives.

          Abstract
                  <p>Students’ mathematics self-efficacy (MSE) is strongly associated with learning behaviours and performance, and students’ future career choices. In our scoping review, we screened what substantive foci (conceptualization, directionality and role of MSE, change in MSE, and situational specificity of MSE) have been posed and which methodological approaches (participants, analytical methods, data sources, and congruence of measures) have been used in recent (2018–2022) studies of MSE. Studies of MSE were clearly in the mathematics domain with 21 of 49 included studies exploring specific mathematics areas. The key focus was on strength of MSE. International databases (i.e., PISA) have enabled broad generalization, while in-depth qualitative studies enable minute situation-specificity. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using hierarchically nested designs (i.e., students in classrooms) enable us to draw conclusions at both individual, classroom, and school levels. The current state-of-the-art indicates methodological advancement is rapid and we are likely to see further methodological-substantive synergies in the field of MSE in future studies. We see the potential and need for future mixed-methods studies that continue the focus on MSE as a multidimensional and dynamic concept. Careful consideration of the theoretical background of the construct of MSE continues to be important to bring the field forward.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>PhD students’ experiences in graduate school and associated outcomes vary by field of study, learning environment conditions, and support structures. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic specifically, PhD students’ individual educational trajectories were potentially rendered more uncertain, as disruptive conditions for learning and research have continued over the past several years. We compared the reports of 422 PhD students at 12 U.S. institutions in terms of their experiences of support or marginalization and educational plans from the summer of 2020 with follow-up data gathered during the summer of 2021. We then examined factors related to PhD students’ changes in their estimated times to degree. We found lower, but still on average moderate, levels of depression symptoms compared to the previous year and continued experiences of emotional, financial, educational, and career stressors. Findings point to the importance of institutional material and psychological structural supports over time.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this research, our objective is to characterize the problem-solving procedures of primary and lower secondary students when they solve problems in real class conditions. To do so, we rely first on the concept of heuristics. As this term is very polysemic, we exploit the definition proposed by Rott (2014) to develop a coding manual and thus analyze students’ procedures. Then, we interpret the results of these analyses in a qualitative way by mobilizing the concept of semantic space (Poitrenaud, 1998). This detailed analysis of students’ procedures is made possible by collecting audiovisual data as close as possible to the students’ work using an action camera mounted on the students’ heads. We thus succeed in highlighting three different investigation profiles that we have named explorer, butterfly, and prospector. Our first results tend to show a correlation with these profiles and the success in problem-solving, yet this would need more investigation.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Using a mixed methods approach, we explore a relationship between students’ graph reasoning and graph selection via a fully online assessment. Our population includes 673 students enrolled in college algebra, an introductory undergraduate mathematics course, across four U.S. postsecondary institutions. The assessment is accessible on computers, tablets, and mobile phones. There are six items; for each, students are to view a video animation of a dynamic situation (e.g., a toy car moving along a square track), declare their understanding of the situation, select a Cartesian graph to represent a relationship between given attributes in the situation, and enter text to explain their graph choice. To theorize students’ graph reasoning, we draw on Thompson’s theory of quantitative reasoning, which explains students’ conceptions of attributes as being possible to measure. To code students’ written responses, we appeal to Johnson and colleagues’ graph reasoning framework, which distinguishes students’ quantitative reasoning about one or more attributes capable of varying (Covariation, Variation) from students’ reasoning about observable elements in a situation (Motion, Iconic). Quantitizing those qualitative codes, we examine connections between the latent variables of students’ graph reasoning and graph selection. Using structural equation modeling, we report a significant finding: Students’ graph reasoning explains 40% of the variance in their graph selection (standardized regression weight is 0.64, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that students’ quantitative forms of graph reasoning (i.e., variational and covariational reasoning) influence the accuracy of their graph selection.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Although research has shown that numeration units are essential for learning whole numbers, students in France still face challenges in understanding units, since learning is often limited to designating the position of digits in the writing of numbers. This article investigates a study conducted among 4th and 5th graders, comprised of a baseline scenario and variations, which examines a quantity comparison problem that aims to strengthen the understanding of numeration units as a system of units organized according to the decimal principle. Using teaching design methodology, we describe the design choices (a priori analysis) and examine in-class implementation as well as discussions with students (a posteriori analysis). The results illustrate a variety of teaching methods, some of the difficulties that students face, and opportunities to further an understanding of numeration units.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article establishes a framework for teaching and learning for mutual respect. I define mutual respect as intervening on power asymmetries typically found in classrooms by way of according students increased equality, autonomy, and equity. In highlighting how equality, autonomy, and equity interact in ongoing and unpredictable ways in classrooms, this framework permits greater awareness of the many dilemmas with which educators are faced. Furthermore, by attending to the different ways mutual respect can be operationalized (i.e., instruction, organization, social relations), this framework can assist school leaders when determining how school-level decisions may interact with mutual respect in classrooms. This framework is thus a tool for researchers and educators when considering how to transform teaching and learning to promote social justice.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This study investigated the underexplored topic of teacher preparation program admissions processes by interviewing faculty and analyzing program documents. We investigated how 31 K-12 mathematics and science teacher preparation programs (MSTPPs) and faculty attend to diversity, equity, inclusion, and social and racial justice (DEIJ). Specific foci included applicant recruitment and selection, components of applications (e.g., forms, essays, and interviews), and how applicants’ DEIJ-related information and orientations factor into admissions. We found that all MSTPPs participating in the study collected information related to DEIJ (e.g., applicants’ ethnoracial backgrounds, citizenship), and all interviewed faculty expressed an interest in increasing the diversity of applicants and admitted students. Faculty expressed preferences for applicants who evidenced positive DEIJ orientations, such as recognizing social and ethnoracial injustices, but at the same time, differences were evident in how MSTPPs and faculty attended to DEIJ. Considerations, implications, and dilemmas for teacher preparation programs and faculty are discussed.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Corporal punishment (CP), or inflicting pain through spanking, hitting, and paddling, is still legally sanctioned and exercised in U.S. schools. We use critical discourse analysis and draw on state policy documents and data from the Office of Civil Rights to investigate which discourses pervade policy texts and how CP is practiced. These sources reveal discourses relating to morality, delinquency, and authority that draw on ideas associated with power, punishment, and control. Across all these discourses, we find color-evasive and deficit language to justify CP practices that are disproportionally applied to minoritized students. We conclude with policy implications for CP and school discipline more broadly.
