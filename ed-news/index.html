          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ beliefs influence their teaching practices. Given the U.S. Secretary of Education’s push to increase multilingualism, this systematic literature review examines teachers’ beliefs about language diversity and multilingual learners in relation to teacher experiences, teaching practices, and external factors. Using 17 search terms, we searched seven databases for empirical, peer-reviewed studies that examined K–12 teachers’ language beliefs. We analyzed 63 studies that met our criteria using a framework of teacher beliefs. Our findings indicate that researchers use myriad terms to capture the participating teachers’ beliefs. These terms could be grouped into dominant language, subtractive, additive, and pluralist beliefs. We also found connections between teachers’ beliefs on one side and their life experiences, instructional practices, and external factors, such as high-stakes tests and school contexts, on the other side. We added teachers’ beliefs about families, content and knowledge, and diversity to the framework, as well as external factors.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Dual enrollment (DE)—where students earn college credits during high school—is expanding rapidly. To facilitate DE, institutional actors across K-12 schools and colleges must build or repurpose structures across separate organizations to determine course offerings, assignments, modality, and composition. Yet the organization and implications of those structures remain a black box. Using statewide administrative data from Texas, we describe DE coursetaking and course characteristics for traditional Texas public high school students and examine how DE course characteristics predict students’ course performance and subsequent college enrollment. Our descriptive analyses illuminate striking differences between academic and career and technical education DE, both in students’ backgrounds and course structures. Our regression analyses illustrate how several malleable DE course characteristics predict student outcomes.

          Abstract
                  <p>Students’ mathematical learning is bolstered when they have caring relationships with their teachers, yet there is little research on how learning environments may constrain or facilitate teacher care. In this study, I investigate how secondary mathematics teachers understood their care for students online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through analysis of interview and focus group transcripts, I theorize the role of the learning environment in how teachers care for students and their dispositions toward that work. Findings show how an online learning environment both constrained and facilitated teacher care. An obscuration of student thinking online made it difficult for teachers to care for students’ mathematical thinking. The online learning environment contributed to a curtailment of collaborative problem-solving, which in person had supported teacher care for student–student relationships. Teachers described greater privacy with some students online but difficulty getting to know most students. Teachers also reported their care to be conditional on students’ relational initiation or reciprocity. This study highlights the need for professional development for teachers when learning environments shift and future research about learning environments and relational power.</p>

      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Saturday, 27. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Functions are an essential concept in mathematics. The studies that have examined functions in advanced contexts have primarily focused on students’ reasoning about specific types of functions (such as binary operations and isomorphisms) but not on the core characteristics of well-definedness and everywhere-definedness. Here, we report on a study in which we conducted task-based clinical interviews to gain insight into students’ techniques for addressing “is the given relation a function?” tasks. We found that the techniques students employed necessarily extended far beyond those reported in the literature (such as the vertical line test) and relied on the previously undocumented notions of sameness, convention, and ambiguity (for well-defined) and notions of containment, existence, and set operations (for everywhere-defined). These techniques coordinated the domain, codomain, and rule, which previous research has highlighted the importance of but stopped short of directly investigating. Two contributions of this work include identifying successful techniques (as the landscape of functions literature predominantly focuses on challenges and difficulties) and identifying techniques for everywhere-definedness (which had not previously received any direct attention in the literature).</p>

        <a href='https://www.springer.com/education+%26+language/mathematics+education/journal/40753'>Saturday, 27. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Given the challenge of visualizing the main constructs of two-variable functions and their differential and integral calculus, it is essential to consider instructional resources’ use and perceived potential to contribute to students’ understanding. This case study considers how four instructors selected and used digital and physical resources in multivariable calculus and their motivations for doing so. We use the teaching triad of sensitivity to students, mathematical challenge, and management of learning to consider the reasons for resource adoption, studying how these instructors think about the resources they use. We also consider how instructors, students, and resources are reported to interact in multivariable calculus. Findings suggest that the instructors’ concern for students’ learning and their conviction that visualization is crucial in multivariable calculus moved them to explore and adopt different resources, especially ones that were free and easy to use. However, visualization was not the only spatial literacy aspect considered. As the instructors gained more experience with the instructional resources they were using, they reported adopting more student-centered use of these resources that allowed them to do more than facilitate visualization during a lecture. The resources began serving as referents for students as they communicated and reasoned about tasks with the instructor as well as among themselves.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the rapid transition to online quantitative education, leading to unique challenges and opportunities in assessments for both students and instructors. Focusing on undergraduate students and teaching staff at a Canadian university, this study investigates and compares their experiences and perspectives regarding assessment in online mathematics and statistics courses during the pandemic. Framed by the theory of community of inquiry, our analysis highlights how assessment affected the cognitive, social, and teaching aspects of their learning and teaching experiences. The analysis was based on interview data from the focal student and teaching staff participants. Findings indicated that students and teaching staff had complex experiences with the assessments designed and administered in the online courses during the pandemic. Such complexity was attributed to varied factors, such as technology integration, uncertainty during the pandemic, assessment structure, alignment with course content, and connection with real-life applications. Implications for transforming the assessment practices to meet the demands of students and instructors in online mathematics and statistics education were also provided.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper explores the policy, pedagogy, and practice affordances and constraints of teacher education as an environment to develop pre-service teachers’ antiracism commitments. Through critical analysis of interviews with pre-service teachers and teacher educators at three social justice-oriented teacher preparation programs, research findings indicate that the material consequences of passing the edTPA can lead pre-service teachers to deprioritize the antiracist or equitable frameworks that were emphasized in their program. The edTPA’s inattention to racism and antiracist practice signals an irrelevance to some pre-service teachers. These findings have implications for how teacher educators may approach the edTPA in social justice-oriented programs.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This interview-based study examines how justice-oriented K-12 administrators and teachers in Iowa make sense of the recent state-level education policy, H.F. 802. Synthesizing literature on Critical Policy Analysis and epistemic justice, we introduce Critical Epistemic Policy Analysis to understand the micro-level impact of divisive education legislation on efforts to create just and inclusive schools. Findings highlight a sociopolitical terrain with ambivalent and shallow equity commitments, deteriorating support for equity work in schools, and a need to grapple with questions of divisiveness and solidarity in justice-oriented educational activism.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Continuous bounded responses in psychometrics usually come from the visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is a rating scale measurement tool that requires respondents to report their agreement with items by tracing a mark somewhere on a fixed-length continuous horizontal segment with ends that are generally labeled “0% disagreement” to “100% agreement” (or other possible labeling) using continuous data. In recent years, the VAS has gradually appeared in medical, educational, and psychological research, such as research on pain, worry, rumination, anxiety, risk perception, and even personality trait measurement. However, there are very few cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) in cognitive diagnostic assessment that can analyze such continuous bounded data from VAS-type scale. In this study, we propose a family of CDMs for the continuous bounded data in VAS-type scale and provide model selection methods for practice. Three simulation studies were used to examine parameter recovery, the impact of model misspecification on parameter recovery, and the effectiveness of the model selection method. Moreover, real data are used as an illustration to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed models.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A key element in the education of youths is their sensitization to historical and artistic heritage. We analyze a field experiment conducted in Florence (Italy) to assess how appropriate incentives assigned to high-school classes may induce teens to visit museums in their free time. Noncompliance and spillover effects make the impact evaluation of this clustered encouragement design challenging. We propose to blend principal stratification and causal mediation by defining subpopulations of units according to their compliance behavior and using the information on their friendship networks as mediator. We formally define principal natural direct and indirect effects and principal controlled direct and spillover effects, and use them to disentangle spillovers from other causal channels. We adopt a Bayesian approach for inference.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The aim of this systematic review is to provide insight into the conceptual and methodological credibility of experimental research designs on the effectiveness of team teaching—a promising instructional strategy wherein two or more professionals collaboratively provide education for a group of students. A total of 31 studies were included. These studies were conceptually and methodologically examined according to two actualized quality-appraisal frameworks. The findings reveal that it remains a challenge to design rigorous experimental studies with clear conceptualizations of key variables related to team teaching. To make convincing claims on the effectiveness of team teaching, there is an urgent need for better-defined quality experimental research. Therefore, we conclude with recommendations for future research, specifically how experimental studies on the effectiveness of team teaching should be conceptually and methodologically implemented to provide policymakers and stakeholders with information for evidence-informed decision-making on educational practices.

We employ propensity score matching (PSM) to generate matched samples using child and family factors known to be associated with children’s early literacy: child sex, immigrant status, unhoused status, special education status, child met Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) benchmark at start of first grade, as well as family income and parental language (DLI &amp; ESL, n = 380; DLI &amp; SEI, n = 380; SEI &amp; ESL, n = 550). Regression models comparing early literacy outcomes for each matched group indicate small trends, based on effect sizes, in favor of DLI programs when compared to other program types, although differences were not statistically significant. Implications for policy and practice related bilingual education are addressed.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='aera open'>Friday, 26. July 2024</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Despite the common title of “coach,” definitions of high-quality coaching vary tremendously across models and programs. Yet few studies make comparisons between different models to understand what is most helpful, for whom, and under what circumstances. As a result, practitioners are left with many options and little evidence-based direction. This is exacerbated by the literature’s focus on more abstract features of coaching practice (e.g., building trust), leaving practitioners to figure out what concrete discourse strategies support these goals. This article begins to address these challenges by introducing a taxonomy of coaching “moves,” parsing the concrete details of coach discourse. While the taxonomy is informed by the literature, it highlights conceptual possibilities rather than providing a list of empirically grounded or “evidence-based” strategies. In doing so, this taxonomy may serve as a common language to guide future work exploring how coach discourse shapes teacher development, synthesizing across studies, and supporting coach practice.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>In this study, researchers used a longitudinal multisite qualitative cross-case study to examine the beliefs and practices of five beginning teachers related to critical historical inquiry. They collected interview, observation, and classroom artifact data over a 5-year period, from teacher preparation through the teachers’ 4th year in the classroom. Using critical theory as the frame, the researchers found that the beginning history teachers tended to move along two pedagogical continuums: one related to the criticality of content and the other related to didactic- or inquiry- based instruction. Teachers were more successful in engaging in critical historical inquiry practices if they had well-developed conceptual and practice tools and had opportunities to teach within school contexts that supported the use of critical historical inquiry.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Across the United States, current curricular reforms are centering high-quality instructional material (HQIM) as a lever for improving classroom instruction and student achievement. While multiple legislative definitions of HQIM attend primarily to the degree of standards alignment, we expand quality to encompass rigor and cultural responsiveness. As teachers make decisions about curriculum materials, they demonstrate curriculum literacy. We conceptualize curriculum literacy as the capacity to navigate teacher identities, learner and community assets, and instructional materials. We survey the literature related to curriculum, curriculum literacy, and teacher education. We then present a framework for curriculum literacy in initial teacher preparation and describe three instructional tools for developing preservice teachers’ curriculum literacy. These tools support teachers’ practices of critically reflecting on their identities in relation to curriculum, contextualizing curricular decisions, and evaluating existing instructional materials. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this contribution, we address the gap that has appeared in mathematics education research and practice with the emergence of dynamic geometry environments and build on the opportunities these environments offer to school geometry. In our qualitative empirical study, we investigate how to elaborate on the general model of conceptual knowledge to make it applicable to dynamic geometry tasks, specifically to tasks including dynamic geometric constructions. We present a design of dynamic constructions of quadrilaterals that comply with Euclidean constructions, derive an assessment instrument based on them, and study what information the instrument can provide about the quality of students’ conceptual knowledge. We present the results in the form of an assessment framework consisting of an example of the assessment instrument and an ordered system of qualitative categories serving as an assessment codebook for interpreting students’ responses in terms of the quality of conceptual knowledge. To clarify the relations between the assessment framework and the general model of conceptual knowledge, we establish a system of subdimensions of conceptual knowledge that indicates how conceptual knowledge can be understood in the context of dynamic geometric constructions and identifies the conceptual knowledge needed to achieve individual categories of the assessment framework.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Many teacher educators seek to implement culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in their courses. However, enactment is often mediated by our socialization into whiteness and niceness. This study investigates how our self-study community of practice (SSCoP) of eight White female literacy teacher educators at different institutions collaborated to narrow the gap between our aspirations for implementing CRP and enacted practice. Through analysis of collaborative journal entries, we interpret tensions between what niceness and whiteness demand of us and what enactment of CRP requires: (a) between centering equity in our courses and addressing equity on the margins, (b) between enactment of critical pedagogy and maintaining status as “nice” educators, and (c) between the expectation of expertise and the necessity of a learning stance. We argue that teacher educators might use SSCoP spaces to navigate the complex interplay between their identities and the sociopolitical context of teacher education to more fully enact CRP.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The narrative woven throughout this article elevates the persistence, perseverance, resilience, and resolve of a neighborhood anchored in faith, and fiercely devoted to its children. Contextualized through its rich history of mobilization for social justice, this story uplifts and defends the cultural wealth of a historically marginalized community as an imperative element of children’s education and as a critical cognizance for those aspiring to become teachers. An exemplar in self-determinism, the narrative, elevates how neighbors’ voice and vision propel innovation in the dynamics of university/community collaboration. Ultimately, the article challenges traditional power structures, offering a compelling and justifiable direction for the field of educator preparation.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>The inclusion of students with disabilities in general education versus more restrictive settings has steadily increased since the 1990s. Yet little is known about inclusion’s effectiveness for these students or their nondisabled peers. I examine the impacts of a district-wide inclusion policy, leveraging the staggered, school-level implementation to estimate the policy’s causal effects on academic and behavioral outcomes. Elementary and middle school test scores and attendance rates were unaffected by the policy. High school graduation and ninth grade promotion rates increased by two and six percentage points, respectively, in the years following implementation. Findings suggest that inclusive education does not come at the expense of students’ academic progress in the short term and may improve academic outcomes in the longer term.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines the relationship between subject specialization in high school and university undergraduate degree program choices. Focusing on a reform in England that encouraged students to opt for studying mathematics in the last 2 years of high school, the study analyzes its effect on undergraduate enrollment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The findings indicate that the reform increased the likelihood of students pursuing and completing STEM undergraduate degrees. Thus, encouraging mathematics specialization during high school enhances the number of STEM graduates. However, despite the reform’s implementation, gender and socioeconomic disparities in STEM participation remained unchanged, suggesting that interventions during adolescence might not effectively address the underrepresentation of specific groups, such as females, in STEM programs.
