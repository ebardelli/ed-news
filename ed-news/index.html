          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Breathlessness support services have demonstrated benefits for breathlessness mastery, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes for people living with breathlessness. However, these services have predominantly been implemented in hospital and home care contexts. This study aims to evaluate the adaptation and implementation of a hospice-based outpatient Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service (MBSS) in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided this study. People with chronic breathlessness participated in longitudinal questionnaires (n = 10), medical record audit (n = 14) and a post-discharge interview (n = 8). Caregivers (n = 1) and healthcare professionals involved in referral to (n = 2) and delivery of (n = 3) the MBSS participated in a cross-sectional interview. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated deductively via the pillar integration process, guided by the RE-AIM framework. Integration of mixed methods data enhanced understanding of factors influencing the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the MBSS, and the potential outcomes that were most meaningful for service users. Potential threats to the sustainability of the MBSS related to potential preconceptions of hospice care, the lack of standardized discharge pathways from the service and access to primary care services to sustain pharmacological interventions. This study suggests that an adapted multidisciplinary breathlessness support intervention is feasible and acceptable in a hospice context. However, to ensure optimal reach and maintenance of the intervention, activities are required to ensure that misconceptions about the setting do not influence willingness to accept referral to MBSS services and integration of services is needed to enable consistency in referral and discharge processes.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 151-156, March/April 2023. <br>Despite longstanding criticisms of teacher education, the weight of substantial evidence indicates that teachers who have had more preparation for teaching are more confident and successful with students than those who have had little or none. Recent evidence also indicates that reforms of teacher education creating more tightly integrated programs with extended clinical preparation interwoven with coursework on learning and teaching produce teachers who are both more effective and more likely to enter and stay in teaching. An important contribution of teacher education is its development of teachers’ abilities to examine teaching from the perspective of learners who bring diverse experiences and frames of reference to the classroom.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 131-139, March/April 2023. <br>Situated in the context of Israeli in-service education, this article explores the development of the author’s understanding of the process of learning to mentor from the acquisition of communicative competencies (as identified in an initial study), toward a more discursive view of the process as “participation in competing discourses of practice” (as identified in subsequent studies). Recent work has revealed the intricacies and complexities entailed in translating from one language (teaching) to another (mentoring), often positioning mentors as “lost in translation.” Specifically, studies shed light on issues of morality, expertise, context, and conditions for learning to mentor. To discuss the author’s evolving understandings, she attends to three interrelated themes: Mentoring as connected to teaching, mentoring as distinct from teaching, and conditions for learning to mentor. Finally, the author addresses the question, So what? to consolidate her emergent understandings of the metaphor, framed as assertions for thinking about the practice of mentoring.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 160-166, March/April 2023. <br>This paper describes the work of a nine-college consortium that aimed to address the minority teacher shortage. First, the consortium's beginnings, aims, and activities are presented. Then the collaborative process is analyzed in terms of nine factors that have been identified in the literature as contributors to effective collaboration: (a) commitment of institutional officials, (b) mutual needs and interests, (c) clarity about goals, roles, and control, (d) sufficient time, (e) energy, (f) effective communication, (g) resources, (h) leadership, and (i) ongoing evaluation. The analysis resulted in the identification of three additional factors that support successful collaboration: (a) levels of collaboration, (b) continual redefinition, and (c) avoidance of interinstitutional conflicts.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 171-177, March/April 2023. <br>Current work to identify the core teaching practices that should be included in teacher education curriculum is a part of a long-standing tradition of reform in American teacher education. This article situates the proposals of Hiebert and Morris and the contemporary work to which it is linked within this historical tradition and identifies several issues that need to be addressed by this current work. These include the task of developing a system that unlike performance-based systems in the past is evidence-based, manageable, and sustainable, and that does not ignore important aspects of good teaching.

The article first describes two remarkable teachers in California to illustrate what strong teaching of diverse students looks like. It then discusses what the diverse students of this nation need of teachers, including teachers with high expectations for student learning regardless of students’ current performance, teachers who can engage students academically by building on what they know and what interests them, teachers who can relate to their families and communities and read students in culturally accurate ways, and teachers who can envision diverse students as constructive participants in a multicultural democracy. The article concludes by outlining three ways in which the president can support excellent teaching by recognizing the value of teacher professional development and by strengthening funding for teacher education in various areas.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In the migrant journey across the Mediterranean Sea, thousands have perished and many more have gone missing. Behind every missing migrant is a community awaiting closure and demanding answers. This paper draws from a US- and Tunisia-based Participatory Action Research project of visual-digital storytelling to suggest how visual and spatial questions may inform and contribute to action and social justice work, aiming to scale down the Mediterranean Sea to the personal. We highlight conceptual and procedural facets of our work, including an exhibition and an online platform, to illustrate the triple concerns of visuality, spatiality and social justice.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 42-46, April 2023. <br>The school lives of students and educators have long been affected by technological changes, but the advent of digital technologies, from smartphones to social media, have amplified the effects on their daily lives. Unfortunately, school curricula rarely focus on critically examining our relationships with technologies. Daniel G. Krutka, Jacob Pleasants, and T. Philip Nichols offer a framework called the technology education iceberg to help educators plan and reflect on how they teach about technology. They argue that the science, social studies, and English subject areas offer opportunities to encourage a technoskeptical stance in students and educators that is needed for flourishing lives and democratic societies.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 47-53, April 2023. <br>Schools have become increasingly interested in social-emotional learning (SEL) over the past decade, and that interest has grown due to concern about student well-being resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is confusion around SEL. Christi Bergin, Christina Cipriano, Tia Barnes, Shannon B. Wanless, researchers who have studied and designed SEL for decades, respond to questions frequently asked by educators as they consider an SEL approach for their school. They discuss what SEL is, its benefits, how it aligns with other programs, how to select an SEL program, and where to learn more about SEL programs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 30-35, April 2023. <br>Online extremism is on the rise, with boys and young men being targeted by misogynistic social media influencers like Andrew Tate. When boys repeat comments they’ve heard online in the classroom, educators can play a role in preventing students from being further influenced by online extremism. Pasha Dashtgard, the director of research at American University’s Polarization &amp; Extremism Research &amp; Innovation Lab (PERIL), talks to Phi Delta Kappan about the importance of prevention, the harms of toxic masculinity, and the crucial role of teachers and other educators.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 36-41, April 2023. <br>Efforts to improve education outcomes often involve lengthening the school day or the school year in hopes that spending more time in school will boost student learning. Yet, as Frederick Hess explains, U.S. students spend as much or more total time in school as their peers in other industrialized nations. What matters more than the amount of time is how that time is used. Although research into time usage at school is limited, existing studies have shown that much time spent in school time does not involve actual learning time, either because of interruptions or other non-learning activities or because students are not engaged. Hess suggests that, before adding time to the school day or year, it’s important to understand what schools are doing with their time, rethink their routines, and seek to ensure that they are using time wisely and well.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 54-57, April 2023. <br>Despite being regarded as the great equalizer, public education’s close ties with the market economy have made it the great perpetuator. High school teacher Jonathan Lancaster writes that public education has become a structure in which students become career ready, as opposed to world ready. Therefore, educators should shift the narrative away from the how of education, and more toward the why of education.

However, in recent years, it has also been used to protect the rights of LGBTQ+ students and of men. Robert Kim describes how male victims of harassment have been able to seek justice under Title IX. At the same time, men accused of harassment have turned to the law when they believe that anti-male bias drove the decisions to punish them.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 7, Page 64-65, April 2023. <br>Phyllis Fagell advises teachers and a principal who are dealing with their students’ and their own anxiety. A middle school math teacher is finding that more boys than girls in her class are risk-averse when it comes to math. A high school teacher has noticed that a lot of her students are getting sick and missing class when there’s a test. And a principal who’s made some hard calls and gotten blowback wonders if he’s in the right job.
