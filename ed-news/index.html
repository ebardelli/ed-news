          Abstract
                    <p>Learners of mathematics who are linguistically disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, including impoverished socioeconomic status, continue to be educationally disadvantaged and at considerable risk of school failure and early dropout. This is the case in many parts of the world. While much has been researched on linguistically disadvantaged learners in the fields of sociology and general pedagogy, little is known about the classroom teaching of mathematical content in language-responsive ways for all learners in school. Experienced mathematics teachers draw on a wealth of knowledge of content teaching in language-responsive ways developed through their practices working with linguistically disadvantaged learners in their classrooms. In this paper we report on interviews with some of these experienced mathematics teachers from seven educational contexts focusing on teaching probability in language-responsive ways. We focus on what we can learn from these teachers that could inform our practice as mathematics teacher educators and our research. We identify three challenges and three practices that add nuance and depth to theoretical research findings and recommendations on language in mathematics teaching, which can potentially develop these findings in more practical and accurate ways.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics education research tends to center on what Mathematics Teacher Educators-Researchers (MTERs) work on or the people (teachers and students) they work with. Rarely, research in mathematics education focuses on MTERs working with one another. This article decenters from these traditional foci and instead examines a heterogeneous group of MTERs describing their research collaborations for professional development efforts on social justice issues in mathematics education. The MTERs’ paired conversations focused on their retrospective stories of their collaborations were analyzed using an Anzaldúan framework to name the different spaces of collaboration that MTERs identified. Results provide insight into how MTERs’ identified binarized spaces linked to their identities and compounded by issues of power. Nevertheless, MTERs also identified spaces where boundaries were blurred promoting a nos/otras space of collaboration. We discuss how collaboration reaches beyond doing the same research work and sharing talent but also understanding the work of one another.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics teacher education is often described in terms of the mathematical content and pedagogy that teachers need. However, recent calls for equity in mathematics education demand a broadening of this view. In this article, we articulate a theoretical description of what the role of being an advocate in language-diverse classrooms could involve and some of the practical challenges that mathematics teacher educators may have when introducing it, using empirical examples from our teacher education courses for teachers of Grades 1–7 in Norway. In the theoretical description of the role of being an advocate into mathematics teacher education, we distinguish between in-class advocacy and advocacy beyond the classroom and what these different kinds of advocacy might entail in language-diverse classrooms. The practical issues that we identified in raising different aspects of the role indicate the need for further research into how to raise preservice teachers’ awareness about the role of being an advocate, in and outside of the classroom, in different cultural settings and how this knowledge could be used in teacher education to challenge preservice teachers’ language ideologies and raise non-trivial issues.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>The sanctioned language around “mathematics teacher knowledge” in the US centers pedagogy, content (mathematical knowledge), and students. Yet, this teacher learning approach often promotes (explicitly or implicitly) teaching and learning of mathematics that operationalizes mathematics as rigid, as a gatekeeper, and only useful for global competition in STEM-related fields. These tacit capitalist goals result in teachers being expected to convey “clear and useful” mathematical information to students, not question why mathematics is being taught, who benefits, and/or how to intervene if the learning environment is harmful for students who are Black, Indigenous, students of Color, multilingual, dis/abled, queer, nonbinary, and/or of immigrant backgrounds. In this article, we build upon a form of relational knowing that intertwines mathematics, pedagogies, students, and politics called Political Conocimiento in Teaching Mathematics. Focusing on political knowledge brings the margins to the center by recognizing political issues cannot be separated from other dimensions or added on, as if politics are not already present in mathematics teaching and learning. As three women of Color, we present empirical results from three teacher education programs in the USA with teacher candidates (n = 55) who range in intersectional identities. Using scenario-based activities that support their development of political knowledge, we apply the lens of “The Mirror Test” to highlight how teacher candidates’ intersectional identities influenced the ethical identities they enacted. Some candidates focused more on “accountability” while others focused on “performativity.” We offer implications for future research on ethical identities in mathematics education with teachers and teacher candidates of various intersectional identities.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>In this paper we investigate the issue of representation within the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education (JMTE) and the broader academic publishing landscape, particularly focusing on the underrepresentation of authors from various world regions. A questionnaire, distributed globally, aimed to amplify the voices of the underrepresented, exploring the constraints and affordances of publishing in English-medium mathematics education research journals. The question that guided our investigation was: What do voices from the mathematics education community raise in their responses to questions about publishing in English-medium research journals like JMTE? We used qualitative methods to review the responses and identify common themes. The findings revealed significant barriers and challenges related to language, research location, and institutional support, highlighting the complexities of navigating the global academic community and the academic publishing culture. We propose actionable suggestions to foster a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive publishing environment.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Previous studies in higher education have found that a considerable number of students do not access feedback. Here, we use assessment system data on nearly 300,000 assignment submissions to statistically analyze demographic and timing factors leading to lower likelihood of feedback collection. The most significant factors were student performance, gender, course level, assignment number, and timeliness relative to the next assessment date. Deprivation was not found to be significant once other factors were accounted for. The insights gained from this study suggest dedicated time for reviewing feedback in course design and consideration of demographics in engagement interventions are needed.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Systematic reviews have witnessed significant growth across many fields, including education. In this article, we outline the background of this growth, highlight the tendency to focus on methodological considerations, and propose a framework to support education researchers in preparing systematic reviews with broad impact. We draw on our experience working with education stakeholders in Singapore and on international scholarship to propose a framework that supports education researchers in clarifying and specifying their aims and audiences and crafting syntheses of appropriate types. Our aim is that this framework, which includes examples illustrating four categories of reviews, acts as a reflective tool which researchers can use to maximize the utility, value, and potential impact of education research.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>As ecological globalization intensifies, rural waste recycling and management has become a global concern. China’s proactive efforts are significant for revitalizing domestic rural ecosystems, offering valuable insights into global environmental governance. The rampant dumping and informal processing of hazardous waste in rural China pose severe threats to local ecological balance and public safety. Thus, efficiently recycling hazardous rural and agricultural waste is pivotal for China’s rural ecological and environmental governance. This study adopts a participatory governance perspective and establishes a theoretical framework for dual principal-agent relationships. This framework examined 22 cases of rural governance spanning Eastern, Central, and Western China. This study evaluated governance mechanisms in four dimensions: policy, material, human, and social capital, using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method. The key findings include: (1) The adverse orientation and behavior of hazardous waste recycling governance in rural areas stem from the combined impacts of multiple complex factors. (2) The synergistic interplay between policy, human, and social capital is crucial for advancing hazardous waste recycling governance in rural settings. (3) Three pathway mechanisms––socially driven, market-oriented, and system participation––facilitate the effective governance of hazardous waste recycling. Innovative practices in hazardous waste recycling and management within rural China yielded positive domestic impacts and profoundly influenced global environmental governance. China’s experiences and approaches motivate other nations and regions, showcasing responsibility and dedication to international environmental governance and bolstering Chinese contributions to creating a cleaner, beautiful world.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Indigenous research methodologies have been theorized by prominent Indigenous scholars over the past few decades and advocated for in research focused on Indigenous communities for their emancipatory power to reestablish Indigenous peoples’ expertise and self-determining and sovereignty rights over education and research. Western intrusion in Indigenous education and community focused research through colonial schools and Western research methodologies has negatively impacted the schooling experiences of Indigenous children, their families and communities, as well as the ways they are studied and depicted in research. Responding to calls for Indigenous methodologies in research focused on Indigenous communities, this literature review introduces an Indigenist Methodological Framework, developed from canonical scholarship on Indigenous methodologies, that we use to explore the applications (and potential misapplications) of Indigenous methodologies in 20 international studies about Indigenous family and community engagement. We aimed to determine if adherence to the elements of an Indigenist Methodological Framework served to disrupt extractive, exploitative, and damage-centered practices in and portrayals of Indigenous communities (common in Western research methodologies). Further, we critically analyzed the findings of these studies to see if they offered more culturally responsive and strength-based conceptualizations of Indigenous families and communities. We uncovered applications and misapplications of Indigenous methodologies that impacted researchers’ commitments to and actions towards establishing and maintaining relational accountability throughout and beyond the research while also influencing findings that, in most cases, challenged narrow and deficit-based perceptions and portrayals of Indigenous students, families, and community members.

          Abstract
                  <p>We offer a new angle to explain the comprehension of mathematical infinity. We use Action—Process—Object—Schema (APOS) theory to explore the construction of different aspects of the cognitive Object related to this notion. We focus our attention on different ways of interacting with infinity, and how to act on infinite entities. Our aim is to shed light on the nature of mental constructions that take place when individuals deal with mathematical infinity. An infinite union of finite subsets of 
                    
                    \({\mathbb{N}}\)
                    
                   provides the context for our theoretical analysis and the design of interviews conducted with graduate students and instructors. In this study we identify three types of Actions with different complexity levels. When these Actions are performed, they lead to the construction of different facets of the associated Object. We question the construction of an Object conception in infinity-related situations and offer an explanation that might change the way we think about the learning of certain mathematical concepts. We discuss the implications of our research for the advancement of APOS theory. We also offer pedagogical suggestions related to the comprehension of mathematical infinity.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Across multiple age groups and academic disciplines, research has shown that incorporating multimodal signs into instruction can enhance student learning. For instance, gesture might be synchronized with speech or written signs. The present study reports on the semiotic resources used by a teacher-researcher to support kindergarten students’ developing understanding of the equal sign. An analysis of seven classroom lessons designed to advance students’ understanding of the equal sign and equations in various forms revealed four categories of language and two categories of gesture used by the teacher-researcher that were specifically related to mathematical equivalence. Our findings contribute to understanding the role of multimodal signs in supporting instruction on mathematical equivalence.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Utilizing a lottery-based natural experiment, this study assessed the longer-term impact of early colleges on postsecondary degree attainment. It found that early colleges significantly increased the overall degree completion and associate degree completion rates within 10 years of expected high school graduation. While the impact on bachelor’s degree or advanced degree attainment was no longer significant 10 years after high school, results from earlier years suggest that early college students attained these degrees at a higher rate and faster pace than control students. This study also found that the early college impact on bachelor’s degree attainment was significantly stronger for underrepresented minorities and that the impact on associate degree attainment was significantly stronger for students with higher prior achievement.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>We use longitudinal data across public postsecondary institutions in Tennessee to examine the stages at which potential Black educators disproportionately exit the teacher pipeline. Black and White bachelor’s graduates declare and complete teaching-related majors at similar rates, suggesting comparable levels of initial interest in teaching careers; moreover, newly certified Black college graduates are more likely than their White peers to gain employment in the state. However, in between those points, Black undergraduate program completers are substantially less likely to become licensed. Additionally, Black graduate students are less likely to complete master’s degrees in teaching-related majors and receive teaching licenses, though newly certified Black master’s graduates are again more likely to gain employment than their White peers. These results suggest that the largest loss of potential Black teachers occurs at the end of teacher preparation, which can be explained partially but not fully by inequities in certification exam passage rates.

          Abstract
                  <p>Example-generation tasks have been suggested as an effective way to both promote students’ learning of mathematics and assess students’ understanding of concepts. E-assessment offers the potential to use example-generation tasks with large groups of students, but there has been little research on this approach so far. Across two studies, we investigate students’ responses to a particular sequence of example-generation tasks, posed either on paper or through e-assessment. We identify a striking difference in students’ example-generation strategies and success, for e-assessment and paper-based versions of the same tasks. This suggests the use of example-generation tasks in e-assessment may not be straightforward, and we conclude by discussing the implications for teaching and research.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Project-based learning (PBL) grounds instruction in authentic learning experiences where students engage in real-world explorations that culminate in a final product or performance. We report on a mixed methods study with 43 ninth-grade English language arts (ELA) teachers (22 PBL and 21 comparison) and 1,671 students exploring the feasibility of enacting PBL in ELA classrooms and examining how teachers and students perceived this approach to learning. PBL teachers enacted PBL design principles significantly more than comparison teachers. The majority of PBL teachers perceived positive instructional shifts including more student-centered and authentic learning, more student choice, and greater student engagement. Many teachers also expressed a sense of renewal and passion. Students in PBL classrooms reported more meaningful learning experiences, opportunities for collaboration, and other aspects of social and emotional learning. We discuss tensions, including the challenge of covering required content and skills within a PBL-focused classroom.
