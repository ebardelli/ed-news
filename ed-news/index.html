          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 8-14, September 2024. <br>Adults’ beliefs and knowledge about the state of the U.S. education system drive decisions about policy, funding, program adoption, student participation in programs, and the selection of decision makers to elected positions. Amie Rapaport and Anna Rosefsky Saavedra share national survey data showing that U.S. adults have little knowledge about what is being taught in schools, express neutrality about belief systems undergirding education policy, and report experiences misaligned with hard-data trends on student academic progress in recent years. With adults reporting they learn about issues crucial to our education system mainly from “personal experience,” better information has the potential to improve U.S. education.

The 2024 presidential race is placing even more attention on the partisan divide in local education policies and decisions. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins writes that education advocates can leverage this focus and help put aside partisan politics and meet the post-pandemic challenges students face.

As such, the WIDA Consortium has evolved its guidelines to deepen teachers’ conceptual understanding of language in their content areas, and thus, enable them to provide more effective instruction to multilingual learners. Karen L. Terrell explores one of the primary “key language uses” in mathematics — the narrative genre. She also considers how visuals can be powerful scaffolds and means of expression for multilingual learners and discusses how visuals can be used for students to both receive and express knowledge. The use of narrative and visuals can make mathematics more accessible to all students.

While eight in 10 or more Americans pick those two items as priorities, other policy priorities also win broad support. Seven in 10 — or more — favor an increased focus on addressing student mental health, helping students who have fallen behind academically, and college affordability. The survey was produced by Langer Research Associates for PDK International, with data collected June 21 to July 1, 2024, in English and Spanish, among a representative, random national sample of 1,009 adults.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 44-48, September 2024. <br>In response to the growing awareness of trauma and its impact on student learning, schools across the country are implementing trauma-sensitive practices. Authors Maia Cucchiara and Mary Beth Hays describe an approach to trauma sensitivity in schools: the creation of restoration rooms, spaces designed to help students (and adults) return to a state of regulation. Restoration rooms are not for disciplining students. Instead, they are spaces equipped with fidget toys, soft carpets and cushions, flexible seating, and other materials to promote regulation. Schools can use these spaces as part of larger efforts to respond to student and staff trauma and promote overall wellness.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 15-18, September 2024. <br>PDK polls consistently show that parents give their children’s schools high marks but are dissatisfied with the performance of public schools nationally. This paradox may be explained by the persistent narrative of failing public schools that has dominated media coverage in the past 50 years. Authors Mark Hlavacik and Jack Schneider tracked the prevalence of the failing-schools narrative in print publications, books, and other media. They found connections between national coverage of education and local education reporting. This national narrative of failing schools uses public schools as a scapegoat, which absolves us of our collective responsibility to each other. A more nuanced and multifaceted narrative of public schools is needed.

          Abstract
                  <p>Different types of reasoning, such as intuitive, inductive, and deductive, are used in the generalization of figural patterns, as an important part of patterns in school mathematics. It is difficult to demarcate the constructive patterns where the regularity observed in the first few sentences is generalizable to the other sentences and each reasoning can lead to the correct answer. To examine the types of reasoning used by students and related factors, this study focuses on the deconstructive figural patterns through the design of three targeted tasks. The participants were 33 female students randomly selected from three 10th grade classes in one school. The data collected showed that a consistent reasoning is not used in tasks by the same participant and various factors, such as the appearance of the figures and the concepts used in the tasks, are involved in employing a reasoning. Moreover, the intuitive reasoning under the influence of a salient irrelevant variable was more prevalent than the others in the incorrect answers.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Sunday, 01. September 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>The present study examines secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension based on Duval’s theoretical framework regarding perceptual, operative, and discursive apprehension. The aim is to explore the cognitive structure of the geometrical figure apprehension dimensions (operative, discursive, and perceptual) in three grades of secondary school students. The tasks in the present study were completed by a sample of 881 students attending public secondary education in Cyprus. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the stability of the structure of the model concerning secondary school students’ geometrical figure apprehension. However, differences were found in the interrelations among the three main aspects of the model in the examined grades (9, 10, and 11). Moreover, it was observed that students find it easier to solve tasks involving perceptual apprehension compared to discursive apprehension tasks, indicating a possible hierarchical structure of figure apprehension. The present study acts as a pilot study of the constructed instrument. Finally, the results are interpreted in relation to the type of geometrical paradigm in which students work at each hierarchical level.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Sunday, 01. September 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ordinality skills in early numerical development. Here, we investigate individual differences in ordering sets of items and suggest that children might also differ in their tendency to spontaneously recognize and use numerical order in everyday situations. This study investigated the individual differences in 3- to 4-year-old children’s tendency to spontaneously focus on numerical order (SFONO), and their association with early numerical skills. One hundred fifty children were presented with three SFONO tasks designed as play-like activities, where numerical order was one aspect that could be focused on. In addition, the children were administered tasks addressing spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON), numerical ordering, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production. Our results showed that children had substantial individual differences in all measures, including SFONO tendency. Children’s SFONO tendency was associated with their early numerical skills. To further investigate the association between SFONO tendency and numerical ordering skills, a hierarchical regression was conducted for a group of children who could successfully order sets from one to three at a minimum and were regarded as likely having the requisite skills to spontaneously focus on numerical order. The findings reveal that SFONO tendency had a unique contribution to children’s numerical ordering skills, even after controlling for age, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production.

          Abstract
                    <p>This study argues that the works of philosopher Jürgen Habermas can provide useful directions for mathematics education research on statistical literacy. Recent studies on the critical demands posed by statistical information in media highlight the importance of the communicative component of statistical literacy, which involves students’ ability to react to statistical information. By adapting Habermas’ construct of communicative rationality into a framework for statistical literacy, a novel analytical tool is presented that can provide theoretical insights as well as in-depth empirical insights into students’ communication about statistical information. Central to the framework are the four validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness, and rightness which interlocutors need to address to engage in statistical communication. The empirical usefulness of the framework is shown by presenting the results of a study that examined Grade 5 students’ responses to fictional arguments about the decline of Arctic sea ice. The Habermas-based framework not only reveals that complex evaluations of statistical arguments can take place even in Grade 5 but also shows that students’ evaluations vary greatly. Empirical results include a content-specific differentiation of validity claims through inductively identified sub-categories as well as a description of differences in the students’ uses of validity claims.</p>
