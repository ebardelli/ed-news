          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This mixed-method study examines Michigan’s Partnership policy for school turnaround, which positions the district and superintendents as key policy implementation actors. We first interviewed 21 of 35 Partnership superintendents/leaders across Michigan and surveyed teachers to understand the initial response to the turnaround policy and the strategic planning process. We then used our understanding of these leaders’ responses to conduct a purposively sampled embedded multiple comparative case study of three varied districts. These case studies helped us more deeply understand and compare how districts engaged in the process of crafting coherence and school-level stakeholders’ perceptions of activities related to coherence and implementation of the reform. Based on these two levels of data collection and analysis, we found that many leaders used the opportunity to create new changes, roles, and partnerships, but the majority also symbolically adopted policy demands by aligning their turnaround plans with pre-existing efforts. Using cross-case comparisons of our three districts, we argue that some degree of strategic buffering from policy demands may be warranted, especially when districts have low capacity and face significant challenges recruiting and retaining teachers.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this study, we examine “what went wrong” in our professional development program for encouraging cognitively demanding instruction, focusing on the difficulties we encountered in using an observational tool for evaluating this type of instruction and reaching inter-rater reliability. We do so through the lens of a discursive theory of teaching and learning. Data consisted of 10 coders’ coding sheets while learning to apply the Coding Rubric for Video Observations tool on a set of recorded mathematics lessons. We show that some discrepancies between novice coders and experts were found in narratives about valued actions relating to social aspects of teaching, such as teacher explanations and students’ struggle and discussion. These were relatively easy to detect from the written evaluations in the coding sheets. More problematic to pinpoint were places where discrepancies were found between novice and experts’ stories about the mathematical objects discussed. These required re-observing the recorded lessons. The analysis revealed that novice coders referred to objects about which the observed teacher mainly explained calculations, whereas the experts searched for (often, signaling the absence of) mathematical objects that invited exploration. We discuss these findings based on a theory of different Pedagogical Discourses that form the background for expert and novice coders’ interpretations of the coding manual. We conclude with practical implications for the process of achieving inter-rater reliability on observation tools for cognitively demanding instruction.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In multisite trials, learning about treatment effect variation across sites is critical for understanding where and for whom a program works. Unadjusted comparisons, however, capture “compositional” differences in the distributions of unit-level features as well as “contextual” differences in site-level features, including possible differences in program implementation. Our goal in this article is to adjust site-level estimates for differences in the distribution of observed unit-level features: If we can reweight (or “transport”) each site to have a common distribution of observed unit-level covariates, the remaining treatment effect variation captures contextual and unobserved compositional differences across sites. This allows us to make apples-to-apples comparisons across sites, parceling out the amount of cross-site effect variation explained by systematic differences in populations served. In this article, we develop a framework for transporting effects using approximate balancing weights, where the weights are chosen to directly optimize unit-level covariate balance between each site and the common target distribution. We first develop our approach for the general setting of transporting the effect of a single-site trial. We then extend our method to multisite trials, assess its performance via simulation, and use it to analyze a series of multisite trials of adult education and vocational training programs. In our application, we find that distributional differences are potentially masking cross-site variation. Our method is available in the balancer R package.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are the statistical framework for cognitive diagnostic assessment in education and psychology. They generally assume that subjects’ latent attributes are dichotomous—mastery or nonmastery, which seems quite deterministic. As an alternative to dichotomous attribute mastery, attention is drawn to the use of a continuous attribute mastery format in recent literature. To obtain subjects’ finer-grained attribute mastery for more precise diagnosis and guidance, an equivalent but more explicit form of the partial-mastery-deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate (DINA) model (termed continuous attribute profile [CAP]-DINA form) is proposed in this article. Its parameters estimation algorithm based on this form using Bayesian techniques with Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is also presented. Two simulation studies are conducted then to explore its parameter recovery and model misspecification, and the results demonstrate that the CAP-DINA form performs robustly with satisfactory efficiency in these two aspects. A real data study of the English test also indicates it has a better model fit than DINA.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Preservice teacher performance assessments, such as the edTPA, are one of the accountability policies from states and local authorities designed to ensure the quality of beginning teachers and standardize teacher education. We studied experiences of 65 preservice teachers regarding the effect of the edTPA on their learning in field-placement classrooms. These cases revealed that the edTPA created “protected teaching spaces” for participants to experiment with student-centered instructional practices supported in university courses and codified in edTPA rubrics. This was especially impactful for novices who previously had limited opportunities to try out equitable reform-oriented instruction in their placements. In these cases, the edTPA also helped mitigate inequities in learning to teach, an unintended outcome that is important for policymakers to consider when deciding on credentialing requirements.

          Abstract
                  <p>Digital technologies for mathematics education are continuously developing. Still, much remains unknown about how students use these tools and how this affects learning. For example, tablets nowadays come with multi-touch options that allow for a more embodied approach to geometry education, compared to mouse interactions. However, little is known about how students use these opportunities to develop bodily-based conceptualizations of geometric concepts in a touch-based dynamic geometry environment (DGE). The aim of this study was to investigate students’ dragging schemes from an embodied instrumentation perspective and to identify the types of embodied-dragging schemes that the students use, while transforming one type of parallelogram into another. Fifty-seven 11-year-old students worked on a task on transforming a given parallelogram into a rectangle and next into a square, using a tablet-enabled DGE. Results showed that students used three types of embodied dragging schemes: (a) action-perception dragging guided by perceived prototypical images of shapes, (b) sequentially-coordinated dragging based on initial perception and then utilizing the affordances of the artefacts, and (c) adaptive dragging, effectively integrating action-perception loops and geometrical properties. In schemes of types (b) and (c), geometric properties of the constructed shapes emerged and guided students’ action-perception loops. As a conclusion, this description informs teachers, textbook authors, and designers of digital assessment on how to design student activities. From a theoretical perspective, the embodied instrumentation lens provided a fruitful approach to study student–tool interactions in geometry that does justice to the bodily foundations of mathematical cognition.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>There is a need for a more robust conceptualization of engagement in mathematics education research. Investigating how teachers describe engagement can provide insight into relationships between purposes of engagement and dimensions of engagement. In this exploratory study, we examined how 28 secondary mathematics teachers in two states in the USA talked about their students’ engagement. During interviews, we asked teachers to provide their definitions for engagement, describe their teaching strategies for engaging students, and describe their observations of engagement during a video clip from their own classroom. We interpreted teachers’ talk to identify how they described the nature of mathematics engagement (dimensions such as behavioral, cognitive, affective, and/or social engagement) and purposes of engagement (engagement in learning or in schooling [Harris, 2011]). When teachers described the purpose of engagement as engagement in learning, they also tended to describe the nature of engagement with cognitive and social dimensions and with multiple dimensions of engagement.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates what mathematicians, who teach academic mathematics courses to secondary school mathematics teachers, want to teach them about the discipline of mathematics. Data sources included interviews with five research mathematicians. The data analysis revealed that expanding teachers’ knowledge about the discipline of mathematics was one of the interviewees’ main objectives. The mathematicians referred to nine characteristics that can be grouped into three key aspects: (1) essence of mathematics, (2) doing mathematics, and (3) worth of mathematics. The characteristics of the discipline of mathematics generated in our study are in line with ideas and practices widely advocated in the last decades for the teaching and learning of mathematics, and with contemporary philosophical approaches regarding mathematics. The potential of the characteristics to serve as a conceptual framework in studies that focus on teacher knowledge about the discipline of mathematics is discussed.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Technology innovation is the key driving force in achieving economic transformation and development. Financial development and the expansion of higher education can promote technological progress primarily by easing financing constraints and improving the level of human capital. This study examines the impact of financial development and higher education expansion on green technology innovation. It conducts an empirical analysis by constructing a linear panel model and a nonlinear threshold model. The present study sample is based on the urban panel data of China from 2003–2019. (1) Financial development can significantly promote the expansion of higher education. (2) The expansion of higher education can improve energy and environment-based technological progress. (3) Financial development can both directly and indirectly promote green technology evolution by expanding higher education. The joint financial development and higher education expansion can significantly empower green technology innovation. (4) In the process of promoting green technology innovation, financial development has a non-linear influence on it, with higher education as the threshold. The effect of financial development on green technology innovation varies according to the degree of higher education. Based on these findings, we put forward policy proposals for green technology innovation to promote economic transformation and development in China.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Sleep, activity, and nutrition (SAN) are key components in overall health, and an individual’s knowledge about and self-confidence to engage in healthy SAN behaviors can have an impact on their actions. Objectives: This evaluation examined SAN knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors among U.S. Army Soldiers prior to participating in a health promotion program. Research Design: Baseline surveys from participating Soldiers provide evidence in this evaluation. Subjects: U.S. Army Soldiers (N = 11,485) participating in a health promotion program completed surveys. Measures: Participants completed an online survey assessing SAN knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors (among other constructs). Results: We examined the common patterns of SAN behaviors, the associations between them, and the differences based on gender and rank. Knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors were correlated within each of the three SAN domains. Men reported more aerobic exercise (d = .48) and more resistance training (d = .34) per week than women. Officers reported greater self-confidence in their ability to consume a post-exercise snack (i.e., refuel; d = .38), greater refueling behaviors (d = .43), greater activity knowledge (d = .33), and greater self-confidence in their ability to achieve activity goals (d ranging from .33 to .39), compared to enlisted Soldiers. Finally, greater confidence in one’s ability to achieve healthy sleep correlated with getting more sleep, both during workweek (r = .56, p &lt; .001) and weekend (r = .25, p &lt; .001). Conclusions: These baseline data support the need for health promotion of SAN behaviors among these Soldiers.

          Abstract
                  <p>Teacher educators globally have argued that developing coherent programs can combat the fragmentation that often characterizes teacher education and better support teacher learning. Yet, there is little research on coherence in mathematics teacher education, especially from the perspectives of preservice teachers. To that end, in this article, we report how 13 secondary mathematics preservice teachers (PSTs) from one teacher education program perceived their program as coherent, specifically attending to the ideas and practices PSTs engaged with and the settings in which they engaged with those ideas/practices. Based on participatory diagramming interviews and network analysis, we found that PSTs experienced two main sources of incoherence. First, although PSTs had opportunities to learn about equity from multiple settings, they did not perceive that equity and other aspects of mathematics instruction together were coherently organized. Second, PSTs reported learning about two opposing instructional approaches—direct instruction and inquiry-based instruction. PSTs reported that opportunities to learn about inquiry-based instruction were primarily isolated to courses taught by the mathematics education program and were contradicted by learning and experiencing direct instruction in their special education courses, mathematics courses, and field and student teaching experiences. Findings highlight a need to attend to issues of equity, as well as connections among university coursework and between coursework and field. Based on our findings, we conclude with implications for how teacher education programs might respond to and engage with incoherence to support PST learning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>It is estimated that one-third of students completing their doctoral study in the United States are international. This is notable because the higher education socialization processes for international students are uniquely challenging, yet little scholarship has addressed how these challenges influence doctoral students’ pursuits of faculty careers. Employing multi-institutional data from the U.S. research-intensive universities, this study examined how interpersonal socialization difficulties (based in linguistic challenges, cultural differences, and identity-based bias/discrimination) with peers, faculty, and staff were associated with declined interest in pursuing faculty positions at research-oriented universities and teaching-oriented universities. The results indicated that international doctoral students who experienced interpersonal challenges due to cultural conflicts were more likely to lose interest in faculty positions. U.S. higher education is recommended to help both international doctoral students and people around them to minimize communication difficulties of cultural differences to retain international talents who can be future international faculty.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A tree model for diagnostic educational testing is described along with Monte Carlo simulations designed to evaluate measurement accuracy based on the model. The model is implemented in an assessment of inferential reading comprehension, the Multiple-Choice Online Causal Comprehension Assessment (MOCCA), through a sequential, multidimensional, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategy. Assessment of the first dimension, reading comprehension (RC), is based on the three-parameter logistic model. For diagnostic and intervention purposes, the second dimension, called process propensity (PP), is used to classify struggling students based on their pattern of incorrect responses. In the simulation studies, CAT item selection rules and stopping rules were varied to evaluate their effect on measurement accuracy along dimension RC and classification accuracy along dimension PP. For dimension RC, methods that improved accuracy tended to increase test length. For dimension PP, however, item selection and stopping rules increased classification accuracy without materially increasing test length. A small live-testing pilot study confirmed some of the findings of the simulation studies. Development of the assessment has been guided by psychometric theory, Monte Carlo simulation results, and a theory of instruction and diagnosis.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 24-52, March 2023. <br>We describe the command artbin, which offers various new facilities for the calculation of sample size for binary outcome variables that are not otherwise available in Stata. While artbin has been available since 2004, it has not been previously described in the Stata Journal. artbin has been recently updated to include new options for different statistical tests, methods and study designs, improved syntax, and better handling of noninferiority trials. In this article, we describe the updated version of artbin and detail the various formulas used within artbin in different settings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 53-85, March 2023. <br>Researchers use finite mixture models to analyze linked survey and administrative data on labor earnings, while also accounting for various types of measurement error in each data source. Different combinations of error-ridden and error-free observations characterize latent classes. Latent class probabilities depend on the probabilities of the different types of error. We introduce a suite of commands to fit finite mixture models to linked survey-administrative data: there is a general model and seven simpler variants. We also provide postestimation commands for assessment of reliability, marginal effects, data simulation, and prediction of hybrid variables that combine information from both data sources about the outcome of interest. Our commands can also be used to study measurement errors in other variables besides labor earnings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 86-96, March 2023. <br>We introduce a new command, robustpf, to estimate parameters of Cobb–Douglas production functions. The command is robust against two potential problems. First, it is robust against optimization errors in firms’ input choice, unobserved idiosyncratic cost shocks, and measurement errors in proxy variables. In particular, the command relaxes the conventional assumption of scalar unobservables. Second, it is also robust against the functional dependence problem of static input choice, which is known today as a cause of identification failure. The main method is proposed by Hu, Huang, and Sasaki (2020, Journal of Econometrics 215: 375–398).
