          Abstract
                    <p>When teaching fractions, teachers make instructional decisions about if, when, and how to use the many different types of fraction models and manipulatives. In this study, we sought insights into their pedagogical reasoning with fraction representations via their preferences, both for solving tasks themselves and for teaching (in general and for specific fraction concepts and operations). Nearly 200 practising Australian primary teachers participated in an online survey and we drew on a Fraction Schemes theorisation to analyse quantitative and qualitative data. A majority of teachers indicated a personal preference for the set model for four out of five schemes; for one scheme most teachers preferred the circle model. Their reasons suggested that the nature of each task in a scheme and the specific fractions involved, played a role in influencing their preferences. With respect to teaching fractions, the teachers also indicated a high level of preference for teaching with the set model in general, and secondly for the rectangle model. Their preferences, except for number lines, were not found to be associated with the teachers’ nominated year level. We found that a high personal preference for a set model was associated with a preference for teaching with the same model in general, but not for teaching with the matching manipulative (counters or chips). The teachers indicated a high level of preference for teaching with the fraction bars manipulative for several fraction concepts, but this was not associated with a personal preference for linear models. Implications for further research are discussed.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper presents the process of conducting a community-wide needs assessment that initially focused on soliciting information about childcare needs of families with school-aged children. The researchers were interested in understanding whether the method designed to conduct the needs assessment helped to foster collaboration, trust, and increased participation amongst multiple levels of stakeholders and subcommunities. Utilizing community-based participatory research principles, the authors will present a 3-phase approach to gaining community support through multiple levels of stakeholder engagement. While initially the needs assessment was focused on childcare, the scope broadened to learning about other needs that families with school-aged children faced. The strategic use of Survey Ambassadors throughout the community who could access families that were typically underrepresented and could provide feedback to the researchers in real time regarding modifications to the process was vital. Lessons learned included the need for further investigation into strategic methods for gaining family voices in underrepresented populations.

      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Wednesday, 01. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>In many schools across the world, students experience mathematical concepts as ideas empty of wisdom and possibility. In this paper the authors analyze a philosophical conversation in which fifth-grade students were caught up in the animacy of the concept of space. Challenging the common view of mathematics as dealing with absolute truths and certainty, these students, the materials, and the concept itself formed dynamic assemblages that, through movement and the senses reanimated philosophical considerations regarding the concept of space. Over the course of an hour, students emerged as young philosophers whose ideas about space converged with those of philosophers from diverse fields, including physics, indigenous education, feminist theory, and dance. Using a philosophical analysis, the paper focuses on the vibrancy of a space filled with forces—images, movement, ideas, and materials—that shaped students’ relationships with mathematics and language. Based on this analysis, the paper provides insights for reimagining the teaching and learning of mathematical concepts as philosophical topics that can support a renewed understanding of the relationship between learner, language, and mathematics.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Wednesday, 01. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>Previous research on bilingual mathematics education has proposed that as children “language mathematics” they use multiple sources of meaning. In this paper, we focus on lexical inventions—bilingual children’s made up words that are not formally defined or used but follow the phonology and morphology of a language—as a source of meaning. Consistent with tenets from translanguaging, we recognize lexical inventions as a creative language practice defying idealized language norms. A raciolinguistic theoretical perspective informs our interpretation of children, teachers, and researchers as listening subjects. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mathematical lexical inventions can prompt a translanguaging space where children, teachers, and researchers resist listening subject positions that predispose them to listen for predetermined language practices. Drawing on two lesson transcripts, one from a fourth-grade English-immersion classroom in Colombia and one from a third-grade Spanish-immersion classroom in the United States, we used moment analysis in translanguaging spaces to identify spontaneous and critical moments where lexical inventions prompted mathematical explorations. We argue for adopting listening subject positions as learners of transgressive language practices that are part of interactions between children and mathematics.</p>

      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Wednesday, 01. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism, cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we present insights from a scoping review of research in language education and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical research on language in mathematics education that left interplay between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>This paper provides on-the-ground accounts of epistemic violence against Black immigrant children in mathematics classrooms. From a critical feminist perspective, we introduce Dotson’s notion of silencing as an enactment of epistemic violence. According to Dotson, one way to enact epistemic violence is to damage a particular group’s ability to speak and be heard. A successful act of communication depends on the audience’s willingness and ability to “hear” the speaker. Therefore, denying this reciprocity in communication is a form of epistemic violence. Using this conceptualization, we conducted a secondary data analysis from a larger study aimed at enhancing teachers’ knowledge and abilities to implement problem-solving teaching. We identify and characterize three practices of silencing Black immigrant students in Chilean mathematics classrooms that damage their agency as knowers and doers of mathematics. Beyond language issues, we show that silencing is a form of anti-Black onto-epistemic violence that prevents Black immigrant students from being recognized as legitimate subjects of knowledge in mathematics classrooms.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>This work studies mathematics word problems’ use in a classroom of recent immigrants, or newcomers, to a United States public elementary school. I study how word problems foster the recontextualization of mathematical concepts in a lived reality experienced by newcomer students in their new cultural and educational setting. In this study’s setting language plays a significant role in the process of meaning-making. I describe how language use in word problems remains intertwined with mathematics instruction. This opens a space for questioning word problems’ purpose and role in multilingual classrooms, and I highlight how the creative process of co-constructing problems’ meaning in this context can expand notions of genre applied to word problems. Throughout I adopt a theorization of translanguaging as a language practice and apply it in problem discussion. This helps probe how language use impacts students’ ways of understanding and utilizing mathematical concepts.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics education in India is offered in one of the 22 officially recognized state languages or in English even though there are at least 270 languages with more than 10,000 speakers each. Caste, a deep-rooted structure that stratifies Indian society, is integrally linked to shaping state languages. There is minimal research from India that looks at language and mathematics education and practically none that factors in caste. Focusing on Tamil Nadu, a state with a history of anti-caste movement on the one hand and pure Tamil movement (a movement that sought to create a Tamil language with no words from other languages) on the other, this conceptual paper seeks to explore this dimension. More specifically, by using caste as an analytical framework, and by drawing on examples from the mathematics textbooks published by the Tamil Nadu State Board of Education and the experience of a few teachers and learners, the paper seeks to make a theoretical argument that the use of pure Tamil in mathematics textbooks has negative implication for socio-culturally and economically marginalized students who are solely dependent on textbooks as the only source for learning mathematics. There is a strong need for carrying out empirical work that would highlight the nuances and complexities involved in realizing ‘mother tongue’ education in mathematics, particularly for those who belong to marginalized caste-class backgrounds, and we hope that such work would emerge in the future.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>In this literature synthesis, the three authors bring their embodied voices to collectively retrace the political-cultural-racialized-gendered topographies where key conceptualizations of language, mathematics, and the learner have emerged. Recognizing that they themselves have never been outside these landscapes as mere objective observers, the authors project their situated voices to critically consider—always with a sense of ownership and responsibility—what the field of language and mathematics research has done with/to these conceptualizations. These critical considerations are intended as a collective reminder that the field of language and mathematics education research can move forward by (re)engaging a dialogue between “what is” and “what could be” In this sense, the purpose of this literature synthesis is not to report yet another state of the art in the field, but rather to pierce through ongoing discourses to re-engage the field in reimagining possibilities for reopening, revising, and reimagining the concepts, methodologies, and philosophies that inform research in language and mathematics education. The synthesis concludes with a discussion of how and why our multivocal literature synthesis matters in the field of mathematics education research.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Research on language in mathematics education is largely dominated by a ‘normalcy’ of spoken languages. This modal hegemony does not only affect a whole group of learners in failing to provide access that is epistemologically equitable—those using sign language as their preferred mode for mathematical discourse—it also obscures our view on the roles language can play in mathematical thinking and learning. As a field, we can only win from seeking to understand Deaf learners of mathematics beyond a disability, as learners of mathematics with a specific linguistic background that influences mathematical thinking and learning in peculiar ways. In this contribution, I suggest a shift in mindset towards a more inclusive view on language in mathematics education research and practice. I propose basic principles to inform a perspective for reconsidering the role of language in mathematics thinking and learning, inspired by work of philosopher Francois Jullien. This perspective counters a perspective that merely integrates sign language into existing research and instead searches for dialogue between linguistic modalities in learning mathematics, looking beyond language as spoken or written. This approach will be illustrated by the case of the modal affordance of iconicity foregrounded in signed mathematical discourse, its role in Deaf students’ mathematics thinking and learning, and how this can inform existing research and practice dealing with language in mathematics education.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Numbers and languages are present around the world. While mathematics is deemed as universal, communities around the world have developed mathematical practices that align with their specific context and needs. Rooted in an Indigenous epistemological framework, this manuscript presents a dialogue among four co-researchers and teachers retelling their experiences teaching and learning Mesoamerican numbers in both monolingual (Spanish) and bilingual (Ixil and Spanish) contexts. With a strong desire to learn about and reconnect with the forces of Indigenous mathematical thought and language that move within the teaching and learning of these numbers, the authors collectively reflected on their “tellings” of prior work. It is worthy of note that these reflections on teaching and learning processes of naming Mesoamerican numbers, their symbols, and numerical values help realize that these concepts are more fully animated when presented in contexts that are onto-epistemologically relevant.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>This paper is an examination of the way mathematics, and STEM, arises through stories of teaching and learning on, with, and alongside Land. It emerges from research, undertaken in different Nations (Cree, Dene, Métis, Mi’kmaw, Naskapi, Canada), that considers what locally meaningful K-12 STEM teaching and learning might look like in Indigenous contexts. The paper reflects our research process. Each story is followed by a conversation that surfaces elements of how mathematics, language, learning, and different ways of knowing, being, and doing circulate together and emerge in relation to Land and all relations living within it. We frame the work in ethical relationality to open a space where Indigenous and Western knowledges might co-exist, attending to ongoing tensions in the work between ways of knowing, being, and doing of different people and peoples/nations, between perspectives and experiences of indigenous and non-indigenous participants, between languages, while still creating spaces where we might move closer together through iterative processes of collective learning. This exploration provides insight into how and when we might remember that mathematics has spirit, how quantity and pattern live in various contexts, when numbers might be inadequate for a context, and how all these ideas can meaningfully inform mathematics teaching and learning via relationships between language, mathematics and learners. We seek a mathematics that resists abstraction as extraction and instead lives and enspirits teaching and learning through relationships.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Dehumanized and globalized mathematics education in the last centuries has led to established learning processes disconnected from indigenous knowledge. The effect of cognitive imperialism, given the systematic negation of the language and the culture, has as a disastrous consequence of the gradual and systematic loss of knowledge and indigenous reasoning. Thus, recognizing, appreciating and updating it turns into a task and challenge for the teaching and learning of math in the intercultural classroom. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to focus on analyzing the mathematical reasoning of the indigenous student while encoding and decoding an historic numeric registry artifact called püron (knot in the Mapuche language). The study was conducted in three schools on Mapuche territory of Araucanía Region in Chile, using the Participatory Action Research method. The results show that encoding/decoding quantities helps indigenous students to recognize structures and to establish a numeration system close to the historically reported cultural practices of the Mapuche people. Moreover, it extends the mathematical quantitative structure and reasoning to an arithmetic one seen in the present day cultural practices such as the measurement of fields for planting. Thus, the experience contributes to the students’ linguistic awareness of Mapudungun (Mapuche language) in a numeration system framework.</p>
