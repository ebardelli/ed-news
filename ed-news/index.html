          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 1, Page 72-92, March 2024. <br>Given an exogenous treatment d and covariates x, an ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator is often applied with a noncontinuous outcome y to find the effect of d, despite the fact that the OLS linear model is invalid. Also, when d is endogenous with an instrument z, an instrumental-variables estimator (IVE) is often applied, again despite the invalid linear model. Furthermore, the treatment effect is likely to be heterogeneous, say, µ1(x), not a constant as assumed in most linear models. Given these problems, the question is then what kind of effect the OLS and IVE actually estimate. Under some restrictive conditions such as a “saturated model”, the estimated effect is known to be a weighted average, say, E{ω(x)µ1(x)}, but in general, OLS and the IVE applied to linear models with a noncontinuous outcome or heterogeneous effect fail to yield a weighted average of heterogeneous treatment effects. Recently, however, it has been found that E{ω(x)µ1(x)} can be estimated by OLS and the IVE without those restrictive conditions if the “propensity-score residual” d − E(d| x) or the “instrument-score residual” z−E(z| x) is used. In this article, we review this recent development and provide a command for OLS and the IVE with the propensity- and instrument-score residuals, which are applicable to any outcome and any heterogeneous effect.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 1, Page 93-112, March 2024. <br>Stata’s two-stage least-squares (2SLS) computation procedures are sensitive to near collinearity among regressors, allowing situations in which reported results depend upon factors as irrelevant as the order of the data and variables. This article illustrates this claim with the public-use data of Oreopoulos (2006, American Economic Review 96: 152–175), where the instrumented coefficient estimate can be made to vary between 0.012 and 30.0 in one specification by permuting the order of the variables. Different methods for improving the accuracy of 2SLS estimates are reviewed, and a Stata command for collinearity-robust 2SLS estimation is provided.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 1, Page 3-45, March 2024. <br>In this article, we introduce a package, ddml, for double/debiased machine learning in Stata. Estimators of causal parameters for five different econometric models are supported, allowing for flexible estimation of causal effects of endogenous variables in settings with unknown functional forms or many exogenous variables. ddml is compatible with many existing supervised machine learning programs in Stata. We recommend using double/debiased machine learning in combination with stacking estimation, which combines multiple machine learners into a final predictor. We provide Monte Carlo evidence to support our recommendation.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 1, Page 46-71, March 2024. <br>In this article, we introduce a new command, classifylasso, that implements the classifier-lasso method (Su, Shi, and Phillips, 2016, Econometrica 84: 2215–2264) to simultaneously identify and estimate unobserved parameter heterogeneity in panel-data models using penalized techniques. We document the functionality of this command, including 1) penalized least-squares estimation of group-specific coefficients and classification of unknown group membership under a certain number of groups; 2) two lasso-type estimators with robust standard errors, namely, classifier-lasso and postlasso; and 3) determination of the number of groups based on an information criterion. We further develop some postestimation commands to display and visualize the estimation results.

Researchers can use this package to perform several email tasks, such as contacting students or colleagues with standardized messages. Additionally, researchers can perform more complex tasks that entail sending randomized messages with multiple attachments from multiple accounts; these tasks are often necessary to conduct correspondence audit tests. This article introduces the sendemails command and illustrates multiple examples of its application. The online appendix discusses an application of this package to correspondence audits.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Middle school transitions are increasingly required, despite documented negative effects on general education students (GENs). We explore if and how the move to middle school differentially affects students with disabilities (SWDs), a large and low-performing group. Using an instrumental variables strategy and New York City (NYC) data on nine student cohorts, we find the middle school transition causes a 0.29 SD decline in SWD math performance, a 0.16 SD decline in English language-arts (ELA) performance, and a one percentage point increase in grade retention. Accounting for potential mediators (e.g., peer cohort stability) does not substantially explain estimated effects on SWD performance. However, the middle school transition has similarly large negative effects on GENs, suggesting the need to ease this transition for all students.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Saturday, 16. March 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ assessment of student thinking is both difficult to attain and essential for responsive teaching in ongoing interaction during science lessons. Principles of practice-based learning provide a basis for the design of learning environments which may equip prospective teachers for this challenging task. In an experimental study (N = 104), we examined the extent that the use of different media types as representations of practice (video and written cases), the number of rehearsals, and the complexity of student thinking contribute to preservice teachers’ acquisition of assessment skills. Our findings indicated that participants benefited equally well from video and written cases. The number of necessary rehearsals depended on the complexity of student thinking to be assessed. This finding implies that specifics of the content to be assessed need to be taken into consideration when designing learning environments for practicing assessment skills.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The importance of leadership for key educational outcomes is well documented, yet leaders’ working conditions and well-being have received considerably less attention, particularly in the early care and education (ECE) sector. Job-Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory was used to develop a holistic conceptualization of leader well-being for the purpose of examining the associations among various job demands, resources, and well-being (i.e., physical, psychological, and professional well-being) for leaders of birth to 12th grade (B–12). We tested our conceptual model via structural equation modeling (SEM) with over 2,000 ECE and K–12 building leaders across the United States. We found substantially stronger effects between job demands and well-being relative to job resources and well-being, though resources were found to be directly associated with professional well-being. Further, our tested model was similar for both ECE and K–12 leaders. Overall findings suggest that a reduction in demands—not just increased resources—is needed to ensure improved leader well-being.

          Abstract
                  <p>Assessing students’ (mis)conceptions is a challenging task for teachers as well as for researchers. While individual assessment, for example through interviews, can provide deep insights into students’ thinking, this is very time-consuming and therefore not feasible for whole classes or even larger settings. For those settings, automatically evaluated multiple-choice (MC) items could be a solution. However, it is a challenge to design those items and to adapt them for other countries in a way that they adequately reveal students’ (mis)conceptions. In this article, we investigate the question whether it is valid to use a German adaption of a multiple-choice test developed in Australia for formative assessment of the letter-as-object misconception in Germany. For this, first semi-structured interviews with five German Year 8 students were conducted, and second, 616 students were asked for short written explanations. These data were analysed with regards to the students’ (mis)conceptions and compared with their automatic online diagnosis. In general, a high concordance between online SMART test results and students’ explanations was observed, confirming that useful diagnoses of student misconceptions can be obtained from such a short well-designed MC test.</p>
