          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The narrative woven throughout this article elevates the persistence, perseverance, resilience, and resolve of a neighborhood anchored in faith, and fiercely devoted to its children. Contextualized through its rich history of mobilization for social justice, this story uplifts and defends the cultural wealth of a historically marginalized community as an imperative element of children’s education and as a critical cognizance for those aspiring to become teachers. An exemplar in self-determinism, the narrative, elevates how neighbors’ voice and vision propel innovation in the dynamics of university/community collaboration. Ultimately, the article challenges traditional power structures, offering a compelling and justifiable direction for the field of educator preparation.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines the relationship between subject specialization in high school and university undergraduate degree program choices. Focusing on a reform in England that encouraged students to opt for studying mathematics in the last 2 years of high school, the study analyzes its effect on undergraduate enrollment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The findings indicate that the reform increased the likelihood of students pursuing and completing STEM undergraduate degrees. Thus, encouraging mathematics specialization during high school enhances the number of STEM graduates. However, despite the reform’s implementation, gender and socioeconomic disparities in STEM participation remained unchanged, suggesting that interventions during adolescence might not effectively address the underrepresentation of specific groups, such as females, in STEM programs.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article used a rich longitudinal data set from four school districts in California to study absenteeism patterns among students classified as an English learner (EL). We looked at absence patterns overall and disaggregated by EL classification, grade level, and pre/post COVID-19. When their demographic and school-level factors are considered, ELs have fewer absences and are less likely to be chronically absent than non-EL students. This finding is evident for all EL classified groups, although the differences in absenteeism for long-term EL (LTEL) and newcomer EL students are markedly smaller than for other EL subgroups. The negative absenteeism patterns for ELs shifted after the COVID-19 pandemic. EL-classified students experienced higher absenteeism rates during the pandemic even when holding other factors constant. This rising absenteeism trend is most evident for current ELs and LTELs.

        <a href='https://www.springer.com/journal/42330'>Wednesday, 24. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The old canard that Indigenous and First Nations peoples had, or have, only rudimentary mathematical skills has been curiously persistent, against widespread published evidence over the past century and a half. In Australia, attempts to include Indigenous mathematical knowledge in curriculums have encountered strong resistance. After more than 12 years of advocacy and development by expert Indigenous advisers, content elaborations on Indigenous mathematics were included in the 2022 release of the Australian school curriculum. This hard-won achievement is welcomed widely, but experience also tells us to expect some resistance from sectors of the education communities who maintain and gatekeep an exclusively British-European or Western provenance of mathematics. In this article, we employ an exemplary approach to counter such narratives by summarising and replying to five published critiques of Indigenous mathematics, which typify widely held and propagated misconceptions. We seek to forestall potential pushback constructively, and address concerns regarding the legitimacy and pedagogical value of Indigenous mathematics, by countering with evidence claims in these critiques that Australian First Nations peoples historically had no autonomously developed mathematical knowledge. In doing so, we seek to stimulate more diverse and inclusive discussions of the underlying questions of ‘What is mathematics?’ and ‘Who can do mathematics?’. Although our research originated in a particular national context, the foundational importance of mathematics within and between all societies entails a global response to address these and similar pervasive misconceptions.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Experienced P-12 teachers play a crucial role in the learning of preservice mathematics teachers, though the preparation provided them can be inconsistent or even lacking. In this paper, we share two case studies of secondary mathematics teachers serving as mentor teachers as they engage in a professional development experience designed to shift both their mentoring practice and their perceptions of their roles as mentor teachers. To this end, we simultaneously leveraged Feiman-Nemser’s vision of educative mentoring and NCTM’s effective teaching practices to create a semester-long professional development opportunity focused on practice-based educative mentoring. Drawing on written reflections and video recorded planning and debriefing discussions between two sets of mentors and preservice teachers, we developed profiles of two mentor teachers as they refined their mentoring practice. Based on our findings, we suggest a set of key elements for a professional development framework for practice-based educative mentoring.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Maternal, neonatal, and child health play crucial roles in achieving the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2030, particularly in promoting health and wellbeing. However, maternal, neonatal, and child services in Moroccan public hospitals face challenges, particularly concerning mortality rates and inefficient resource allocation, which hinder optimal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the operational effectiveness of 76 neonatal and child health services networks (MNCSN) within Moroccan public hospitals. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), we assessed technical efficiency (TE) employing both Variable Returns to Scale for inputs (VRS-I) and outputs (VRS-O) orientation. Additionally, the Tobit method (TM) was utilized to explore factors influencing inefficiency, with hospital, doctor, and paramedical staff considered as inputs, and admissions, cesarean interventions, functional capacity, and hospitalization days as outputs. Our findings revealed that VRS-I exhibited a higher average TE score of 0.76 compared to VRS-O (0.23). Notably, the Casablanca-Anfa MNCSN received the highest referrals (30) under VRS-I, followed by the Khemisset MNCSN (24). In contrast, under VRS-O, Ben Msick, Rabat, and Mediouna MNCSN each had three peers, with 71, 22, and 17 references, respectively. Moreover, the average Malmquist Index under VRS-I indicated a 7.7% increase in productivity over the 9-year study period, while under VRS-O, the average Malmquist Index decreased by 8.7%. Furthermore, doctors and functional bed capacity received the highest Tobit model score of 0.01, followed by hospitalization days and cesarean sections. This study underscores the imperative for policymakers to strategically prioritize input factors to enhance efficiency and ensure optimal maternal, neonatal, and child healthcare outcomes.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study assessed the effectiveness of a spatialized mathematics intervention on the mathematical performance and spatial visualization skills of students from an underprivileged Indonesian community. Grade 8 students (N = 407) were assigned to one of twelve experimental classes, receiving the spatial mathematics intervention, or one of seven control classes, continuing with the standard mathematics curriculum. Prior to and following the intervention, a pre-test and post-test design was administered. The data were analyzed using Analysis of Covariance to ascertain the effect of the intervention. Results revealed that the students in the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in spatial visualization skills and mathematics performance (including both spatial and non-spatial competencies), compared to the control group. Importantly, the findings provide evidence that the transfer effects of the spatialized curriculum occur differentially for students of varying ability levels. The findings highlight the importance of spatial intervention in enhancing mathematics performance and spatial visualization skills. The study suggests potential avenues for a paradigm shift in mathematics education that recognizes and embraces the profound influence of spatial thinking.</p>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reports on reflection-based monitoring tools developed and used in an action research project to improve gender equality in science and research institutions. Several of these tools were developed to facilitate individual and joint reflection from the perspective of the co-researchers involved. The aim of the article is to make the case for the integration of a systematic reflection-based monitoring approach, to describe its approach and theoretical underpinnings that link critical reflection theory with reflexive action learning theory, and to present the details of six monitoring tools so that they can be adopted in other project settings. It also highlights how these monitoring tools stimulated both individual and group reflection and how they facilitated the sharing of knowledge and experience between change agents involved in co-production. The article also shows that the process monitoring approach based on systematic reflection can contribute to successful project implementation and offers several important advantages.
