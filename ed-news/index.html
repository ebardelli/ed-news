      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/epx'>Tuesday, 30. January 2024</a> | 
        
          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Departing from mainstream accounts of the post-Katrina New Orleans state takeover and the more recent “unification” of schools under local governance, this case study utilizes the plantation (Hartman, 1997; Woods, 1998, McKittrick, 2011) as a theoretical device and the silenced archive (Trouillot, 2015) as a method of inquiry to better understand why and how a Black public high school was obliterated. Data analysis indicates that despite the takeover and the damning of John McDonogh Senior High, this school was a lynchpin of struggle for democratic public schooling. Additionally, findings suggest that the charter school movement deployed community engagement, an evolving technology, to obliterate a collective vision that fell beyond the parameters of “choice.” In closing, the article points to an absence of empirical evidence on the all-charter structure, the ever-present use of the city as a laboratory for restructuring efforts elsewhere, and a pressing need for building and sustaining researchers who are accountable to African American communities in New Orleans.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 62-64, February 2024. <br>Until recently, few states offered vouchers to help families pay for private schools. But over the last two years, more states have begun enacting “universal” voucher laws, which permit any school-age child in the state to attend private schools using taxpayer funds that would or could otherwise support public education. Robert Kim and Jessica Levin discuss the legal and political trends undergirding the voucher movement and why the growth of vouchers will negatively affect public schools without offering help to the students who most need it.

Nearly as many, 47%, call it either not a serious problem (31%) or not a problem at all (16%).

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 42-45, February 2024. <br>The lessons Angela Maiers has learned from her students prompted her to explore the importance of mattering. She discovered that being valued is not a socioemotional or mental health issue. It is rooted in biology. Maiers has written four books on the concept of mattering and unleashing individual genius in students, including Genius Matters and Classroom Habitudes. She spoke with Phi Delta Kappan about what schools get wrong about student motivation, how mattering interventions take little time but yield big results, and what gives her hope.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 46-53, February 2024. <br>Learning is iterative. It takes time and effort. Real progress in any subject requires we engage, motivate, and support learners as they take next steps to improve their work. Brent Duckor and Carrie Holmberg show how teachers can use progress guides as a formative feedback tool to re-engage and support students where they are, while keeping the focus on concrete steps they can take to move forward in the learning cycle. Drawing from research and case study evidence, they highlight how students and teachers can move conversations forward in safe and respectful ways. Without relying on graded judgments, the progress guide approach preserves the goals of continuous improvement and recenters learning for all students.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 60-61, February 2024. <br>Education technology companies make millions of dollars from their education products and services. Ed tech companies could reinvest in school customers. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins suggests they could do this by incorporating teachers, especially teachers of color and teachers serving vulnerable subgroups of students, into their corporate board apparatus. They should start rotating teachers onto their corporate boards or develop advisory boards made up of current teachers.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 26-31, February 2024. <br>Project-based learning (PBL) is gaining momentum as a rich and multifaceted instructional approach that is motivating and engaging. Miranda S. Fitzgerald and Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar argue that PBL provides a particularly rich context for fostering students’ literacy motivation and engagement. One reason for this is that characteristic features of PBL closely align with research-supported instructional practices for fostering literacy motivation and engagement, such as peer collaboration, communicating with real audiences, and solving meaningful problems. They describe supporting research and share how educators can use the SMILE concept — sharing, me, importance, liking, engagement — to design and implement PBL to foster literacy motivation and engagement in K-12 classrooms.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 54-57, February 2024. <br>New teachers benefit from mentoring from more experienced colleagues, and the Wyoming Teacher Mentor Corps (WTMC) provides high-quality training for master teachers to provide this mentoring support. As part of the program, mentors learn about assessment, communication, feedback, and work-life balance. Colby Gull and Leslie Rush describe how, as part of the training, mentors identified and prioritized critical principles for maintaining work-life balance. Strategies include shutting down and disconnecting from work, acknowledging one’s own humanity when making mistakes, and prioritizing and saying no when needed. The authors discuss these and other suggestions and how they might be used in school settings.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 19-25, February 2024. <br>For many students, project-based learning (PBL) can be more engaging than more traditional instructional approaches. Over the past 15 years, Anna Saavedra and Amie Rapaport studied seven inquiry-based approaches. Their research shows that PBL has a positive effect on students’ achievement and development of important soft skills. Schools can maximize chances of success by providing expert-created, high-quality, adaptable materials; aligned professional learning opportunities; and a supportive schoolwide culture. Some of the challenges of PBL implementation include the tension between breadth and depth of content, keeping projects central to the curriculum, misalignment of standardized assessments with PBL, and financial requirements.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 37-41, February 2024. <br>Motivating today’s adolescents to read is a challenge. Martha Abele Mac Iver, Marcia H. Davis, and Douglas J. Mac Iver discuss the kinds of literacy instructional practices that address what we know about adolescent motivation. They also review several evidence-based literacy interventions designed to engage and motivate adolescent readers that can potentially lead to improvements in student reading motivation and academic outcomes.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 32-36, February 2024. <br>Recently, the science of reading has garnered much attention in elementary schools across the U.S. The science of reading is a body of research on learning to read that has been accumulated through systematic inquiry. Seth A. Parsons and Joy Dangora Erickson argue that the way the science of reading is being implemented is missing a key ingredient: motivation. There is an expansive research base on the importance of motivation for learning. Using practical guidelines, they advocate infusing the science of reading with research on reading motivation to design instruction that optimally supports young learners.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 8-12, February 2024. <br>Students’ valuing of academic content impacts their engagement in learning and plays a pivotal role in shaping their future academic and career choices. Fortunately, practicing educators can integrate many readily applicable strategies into teaching to enhance students’ valuing of academic content. Drawing from expectancy-value theory, Eric M. Anderman, Yue Sheng, and Wonjoon Cha present five evidence-based instructional strategies with concrete examples that aim to enhance students’ valuing of academic content. These strategies can be implemented with minimal additional work for teachers and at little or no additional financial cost to schools.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 5, Page 66-67, February 2024. <br>Beneath the turmoil over book bans, Advanced Placement courses, and teaching about race and slavery lurks a sobering fact about historical knowledge: History is not only about what happened in the past but also about how we know it. Understanding history means grasping both substance and method. If students are asked simply to memorize information about the past, rather than investigate it, then they have learned no way to distinguish historical claims from myths, legends, and lies. The work of history teachers is to build students’ historical reasoning skills so they can determine what is true.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Recent evidence suggests that only about 1 in 5 U.S. adults has a friend on the political “other side” (Dunn, 2020). Although these interpartisan friendships are uncommon, they play a critical role in catalyzing empathy, reducing prejudice, furthering justice, and even restoring democracy, as suggested by the theory of civic friendship (Goering, 2003; Kahane, 1999; Rawlins, 2009). In the present study, we drew on national data from the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS) to examine the personal and contextual factors that predict interpartisan friendship formation among 5,762 college students attending 118 higher education institutions in the United States. The findings revealed the constellation of individual, social, and institutional contributors to students’ capacities to reach across political differences in their friendships. We offer guidance for how college educators can support the development of these relationships that may open a path toward empathy and healing in our polarized society.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>A high level of teacher self-efficacy is considered to be important for a successful and healthy teaching career. This preregistered meta-analysis focuses on whether and to what degree interventions can promote teacher self-efficacy. We included 115 studies representing 11,284 pre-service and in-service teachers in our meta-analysis. Interventions had a significant, positive effect on the promotion of teachers’ self-efficacy (g = 0.47, RVE SE = 0.04, 95% CI = [0.40, 0.54]) with no significant differences between pre- and in-service teachers. A fine-grained coding and systematic review of the targeted sources of self-efficacy according to Bandura’s sociocognitive theory revealed that overall interventions including mastery experiences did not significantly differ from those without. However, interventions targeting only mastery experiences were the most successful for pre-service teachers (g = 0.62, RVE SE = 0.11, CI = [0.35, 0.88]). Based on further moderator analyses, we recommend interventions to integrate reflective elements. Finally, future research should apply stricter study designs and more detailed intervention descriptions.
