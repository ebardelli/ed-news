          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 48-52, March 2024. <br>The annual budgeting process is a valuable opportunity for districts to systematically examine both resource use and programming. They can then use the findings to optimize resource use and improve program efficacy in ways that will lead to increased student achievement. Bo Yan and Thomas Aberli discuss three root causes for districts’ inability to accomplish the goals (reliance on problem-driven needs as the dominant factor of budgetary decisions, disconnect between financial management and performance management, as well as human nature). They propose a cycle-based approach to district budgeting that rests on differentiating investment from operation expenditures.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 38-41, March 2024. <br>Rick Ginsberg and Yong Zhao want educators to question the status quo and clear out ineffective practices to make room for K-12 reforms that work. Their 2023 book, Duck and Cover: Confronting Dubious Practices in Education, Ginsberg and Zhao examine kindergarten readiness, college- and career-readiness, reading proficiency by 3rd grade, social and emotional learning, education technology, class size, dress codes, state standardized testing, meta-analysis, and more.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 53-57, March 2024. <br>While there are plenty of people who decry the parents’ right push, viewing it as manufactured and mean-spirited, Frederick M. Hess and Michael Q. McShane think it has been a healthy and overdue development. Yet while parents have rights, they also have a responsibility to send students to school ready to learn. Schools are ultimately reliant on parents being active partners in preparing their children to be responsible students and citizens. With clear communication and a willingness to listen, families and schools can form more productive partnerships to help students learn.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 42-46, March 2024. <br>After years evaluating teacher professional learning programs, researchers Andrew J. Wayne, Jordan Rickles, Mengli Song, Seth Brown, and Michael S. Garet describe a study that changed their perspective. The study’s takeaways about the design of teacher professional learning are important for everyone who seeks to create systems to support teaching and learning. The findings call attention to the value of streamlined, high-quality programs for improving performance outcomes for teachers and students.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 8-11, March 2024. <br>Many education leaders may wonder how to implement sustainable policy changes that will benefit youth, families, and the community. Arielle Lentz, Laura Desimone, Amy Stornaiuolo, Katie Pak, Nelson Flores, Philip Nichols, Morgan Polikoff, and Andy Porter share findings from school change efforts in more than 170 districts in five states. They present six key strategies based on this work, and they share examples of how districts employed the success factors of specificity, consistency, power, and stability to help build authority, which in turn led to successful implementation of new policies, curriculums, and professional learnings.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 12-17, March 2024. <br>Districts are struggling to accelerate students’ learning, support their health and wellness, and close the achievement gap. Labeled “worst” in 1987, by 2017 Chicago Public Schools was among the nation’s most improved school systems. Chicago’s story embeds many lessons about system change. Sharon Greenberg and Anthony S. Bryk illustrate how local research evidence helped leaders target a few high-leverage processes and informed their ongoing efforts to improve outcomes. Achieving quality enactment of these processes at scale depended on building capacity, which, in turn, took time.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 26-31, March 2024. <br>School leaders Lydia Cochrane and Ayesha Hoda have struggled to meet the increasingly complex needs of the students in their schools. As students’ needs increase, schools are asked to do more and more, while continuing to have strong academic results. Cochrane and Hoda believe the current system is untenable and needs to change. With Linda Nathan, they share a possible model schedule that could allow schools to meet more of students’ needs and describe schools that have experimented with alternate structures.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 32-37, March 2024. <br>As people with power in schools, teachers and administrators make instructional decisions that shape opportunities in classrooms for students to learn. Educators’ words and actions, especially related to the treatment of students and their ideas, are foundational for creating equitable learning communities in our classrooms and schools. David Stroupe, Lindsay Berk, and Anna Kramer examine the creation and growth of learning communities through a particular lens of inequity: epistemic injustice. Briefly, epistemic injustice is a philosophical perspective that deals with inequities associated with knowledge and knowledge production practices. The authors provide concrete examples from two classrooms in which the teachers actively disrupt epistemic injustice.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 18-25, March 2024. <br>Not enough attention is paid to the instructional design decisions that define students’ experiences. Lisa Dover Kingsley and Jennifer Perry Cheatham contend that while quality teaching is crucial, the structural decisions supporting meaningful engagement often go unexamined. Using innovations in North Kansas City, Missouri, as a throughline, they review key themes present in research on four elements of instructional design. They urge leaders to reconsider outdated and unexamined design practices with an equitable approach, centering the voices of students typically left out of such decisions. They offer practical shifts and entry points for leaders to consider as they build a more inclusive and effective instructional design.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 60-61, March 2024. <br>Voter turnout for school board elections is historically low, with tiny percentages deciding who governs schools. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins proposes a new federal holiday, School Board Election Day, to increase voter turnout and public involvement and interest in public schools. School board elections would be held on the same day nationally, and voters would be encouraged to visit schools not only to vote but to participate in forums and projects to benefit schools.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 6, Page 62-63, March 2024. <br>In June 2023, the Supreme Court held that the admissions systems at the University of North Carolina (UNC) and Harvard University were racially discriminatory, effectively ending affirmative action. Are race-neutral admissions policies at selective K-12 schools next? Bob Kim considers two circuit court cases — Coalition for TJ v. Fairfax County School Board and Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence v. City of Boston — in which plaintiffs alleged that schools’ race-neutral admissions policies were discriminatory against Asian American students. In both cases, courts found that the cases were not discriminatory. Although how the Supreme Court might rule if it hears these cases is unclear, the bar for finding policies discriminatory is high, requiring not only a desire to increase diversity but also an intent to harm a particular racial group.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ approaches and mindsets for assessment affect student learning, motivation, and social-emotional well-being. This systematic review examines how initial teacher education programs prepare teachers to enact one core purpose of classroom assessment—assessment for learning (AfL). AfL (also known as formative assessment) is a planned process of instructionally embedded assessment wherein students and teachers collaborate within goal-driven activity, monitor and communicate around evidence of learning, and reflect on evidence of learning to strategize actions to improve. We examined how teacher candidates learned to enact AfL within 70 studies published between 1998 and May 2022. Results illuminate how teacher candidates can learn to enact AfL through a combination of explicit instruction, modeling of AfL, and cyclical opportunities to enact AfL; get feedback; and attune instruction/assessment during their teacher preparation. However, we also uncovered contexts, structures, and practical considerations within teacher education that limit teacher candidates’ learning and enactment of AfL.
