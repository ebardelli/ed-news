          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>While recent research provides insights into how district and school leaders responded to the extraordinary disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, less is known about the role of influential state-level education leaders during the crisis. In this paper, we draw on interviews with state leaders to examine their efforts to support students’ access to education during the pandemic. Findings reveal how state leaders engaged in local-level capacity building, advocacy, and collaboration to promote continuity of education. However, their work was complicated by limited capacity at the state level, political tensions, local control, and pervasive stress over time. The paper concludes with implications for policymakers to better prepare for future crises.

          Abstract
                  <p>Black women teachers have a legacy rooted in resisting and disrupting racism and racialization in schools. Yet, stories of Black women teachers enacting their liberatory pedagogy in mathematics go untold. This study centers Black women mathematics teachers’ liberatory stances towards teaching mathematics to Black, Latinx, and Southeast Asian students. I use a Black feminist lens to conduct a critical narrative study of five Black women elementary teachers that explores how their racialized mathematics experiences informed their liberatory stances of personal accountability, caring, and being a role model for students in their mathematics classrooms. These liberatory stances resisted normalizing whiteness and anti-Blackness in mathematics classrooms within teachers’ schools. Implications include learning about Black women mathematics teachers’ liberatory stances in different racialized social systems as a starting place to transform mathematics education for liberation.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This article examines how making mathematics responsive to perceived differences in students’ real-life needs historically produced racializing distinctions in school mathematics. Decentering social actors and their intentions, we analyze pedagogical techniques in social mathematics courses (1930s–1940s) and social justice mathematics education studies oriented to health and civic participation (1990s–). Despite shifts in ethico-political principles—from enlightening to empowering—racializing effects of these pedagogies persist by projecting relative distances between populations and cultural norms of proper living and well-ordered public life. Juxtaposing past and present, we highlight dangers in how pedagogical interventions to improve malleable differences in children and communities also racialize target groups as yet-to-develop the evidence-based reasoning or mathematical consciousness deemed necessary to attain what are imputed as healthy private and public life. We offer ordering pedagogies as an analytical tool to interrogate practices of racialization and to account for inherited regimes of truth operating in mathematics education by scrutinizing how pedagogical practices produce difference—dividing and ordering students along a hierarchy of perceived needs.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are viewed as potent tools for generalized causal inference. These reviews are routinely used to inform decision makers about expected effects of interventions. However, the logic of generalization from research reviews to diverse policy and practice contexts is not well developed. Building on sampling theory, concerns about epistemic uncertainty, and principles of generalized causal inference, this article presents a pragmatic approach to generalizability assessment for use with systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This approach is applied to two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of effects of “evidence-based” psychosocial interventions for youth and families. Evaluations included in systematic reviews are not necessarily representative of populations and treatments of interest. Generalizability of results is limited by high risks of bias, uncertain estimates, and insufficient descriptive data from impact evaluations. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be used to test generalizability claims, explore heterogeneity, and identify potential moderators of effects. These reviews can also produce pooled estimates that are not representative of any larger sets of studies, programs, or people. Further work is needed to improve the conduct and reporting of impact evaluations and systematic reviews, and to develop practical approaches to generalizability assessment and guide applications of interventions in diverse policy and practice contexts.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This research aims to investigate information asymmetry in e-commerce supply chain channels and the impact of the fair preference model on the behavior and returns of channel members. Therefore, by contrasting it with the model in the completely rational case, this research establishes a more realistic principal-agent model and incorporates the fair preference model into the e-commerce supply chain channel. According to the model’s analysis, the effort level of the retailer at each stage is positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient, and the incentive coefficient of manufacturers is positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient in the case where all rationality is assumed. Manufacturing companies’ anticipated profits are positively correlated with the e-commerce efficiency coefficient. According to the fair preference model, retailers will put forth more effort to sell products when their fixed income from manufacturers is higher and their optimal effort level is positively correlated with that income. When e-commerce’s efficiency coefficient is higher than 1, the retailer’s revenue and effort exceeded those of traditional channels. Manufacturers and retailers both experience Pareto improvements in their earnings after the fair preference model is introduced.

          Abstract
                  <p>The integration of dynamic visualisations, feedback formats and digital tools is characteristic of state-of-the-art digital mathematics textbooks. Although there already is evidence that students can benefit from these technology-based features in their learning, the direct comparison between the use of a comparable digital and printed resource has not yet been sufficiently investigated. We address this research gap by contrasting the use of an enriched digital textbook that includes these features and comparable printed materials without them. To do so, we investigate the achievement of 314 students in a pretest-posttest control group design in a five-hour series of lessons on conditional probability. Using the Rasch model and mixed ANOVA, the results indicate that students can benefit from digital textbook features, especially compared to the use of comparable printed materials. In line with other studies on mathematical achievement and the use of digital resources, our study also shows differences between boys and girls. It seems that particularly girls benefit from the use of the digital textbook, whereas, for the boys, it does not seem to make a difference what kind of resources they use. The group and gender differences are discussed against the background of other studies considering that, especially in Bayesian situations, the way statistical situations are visualised can be decisive for a student’s performance.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent attacks on critical race theory (CRT) aim to limit discussion and understanding of race (and its intersection with class, gender, and power). Racial dialogues can be uncomfortable for those who benefit from power, suggesting that resistance to CRT or any discussion of race and power in education is rooted in emotions. This study examines the role of racialized emotions in public policy discourse that surrounds CRT bans in education that have been proposed, and in many cases, passed across the United States. Focusing on four early-adopting states of the bans, the findings reveal how emotionalities of whiteness are tacitly endorsed, invited, and animated within racialized politics, as well as how these emotionalities might be disrupted.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>School resources officers (SROs) have increasingly become a staple in United States K–12 schools, and research on their roles and efficacy is prevalent. However, policy recommendations, when left unexamined, may perpetuate majoritarian narratives that harm marginalized students. This project investigates the majoritarian and counternarratives surrounding policy recommendations for SRO programs. Analyzing policy recommendations in 100 peer-reviewed articles, we find that most articles recommend reform or retention of SROs regardless of study findings—recommendations rooted in majoritarian narratives about the necessity and benevolence of SROs. Counternarratives, which view harm done to students as a potential reason to remove SROs entirely or reduce their use in schools, are much less common in the literature.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This comparative case study examines two out-of-system education programs created by Black community organizers during the 2020–2021 school year. Applying a unique framework based on the Black radical imagination, I examine how the communities experienced these programs and the potential of the programs to shape advocacy and local policy reforms. This critical policy analysis expands our understating of how racially minoritized communities build political power in education systems and offers educators, policymakers, and researchers guidance for advancing racially just policy change at the local level.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Feminist participatory action researchers (FPAR) recognize transformative praxis as a political, relational, deeply felt and embodied experience that centers issues of power, participation, and relationality. This paper offers an in-depth exploration of FPAR praxis from a study conducted with young people who were learning to be activists in a youth-led organization in British Columbia. This work highlights the generative potential of creativity and art for embodied, affective, intellectual research practices. Specifically, I describe and analyze three research practices designed to generate meaning making: 1) critical reflexivity and interviewing as relational practice, 2) a loving creative embodied analytical practice, and 3) reflective and dialogical analytical practice. Findings provide insights for designing transformative research praxis that can catalyze a greater sense of personal and collective power. Implications of creative participatory methods for documenting and deepening the diverse meanings of experiences of activism, resistance, and community are addressed. I argue for demonstrate the value of FPAR praxis for sustaining social justice work through practices designed to generate spaces for people who are becoming activists to share about their experiences, grow their relationships, and make meaning together.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Ensuring a stable pool of teachers is critical to building a pipeline of future workers, especially in career and technical education (CTE), where programming can lead to immediate post-school employment or postsecondary enrollment. We use longitudinal state data with unemployment insurance records to document workforce dynamics among CTE teachers. We find that teachers in hard-to-staff CTE areas are more likely to leave teaching and are difficult to replace, creating net reductions in the number of students who can be served. We demonstrate that teachers with the greatest likelihood of leaving are also those who earn the most money in their post-teaching employment, suggesting actionable dimensions for policies to help retain or recruit teachers in these areas.Ensuring a steady and stable pool of high-quality teachers is critical to building a pipeline of future workers and professionals to support economic stability, especially in growing and high-wage fields. This is particularly true in career and technical education (CTE) where programming in high school can lead to immediate postschool employment or enrollment in aligned postsecondary programs. Increased policy focus on CTE has expanded program offerings over the last 15 years, and new federal requirements that programs align with in-demand occupations and industries have heightened potential tensions between the private and public employment opportunities for current or potential CTE teachers (Perkins V, 2018). Even before the new federal mandate, CTE teachers were a hard-to-staff group, with school administrators citing higher turnover and difficulty hiring (Hensley et al., 2017). Though the quantitative research on CTE teachers is limited, evidence does suggest that teachers who score higher on content-specific certification exams produce graduates who earn more money in their early years of post–high school employment, bolstering the claim that these teachers are important (Chen et al., 2023).

          Abstract
                  <p>Distributing opportunities to participate in talk-in-interaction during whole-class mathematics discussions is an important equity issue, with multiple studies reporting pervasive inequitable participation patterns in mathematics classrooms. Less attention, however, has been given to the underlying interactional practices that can initiate and support minoritized students’ participation. This article examines how and what kinds of opportunities for participation are interactionally generated for minoritized students in whole-class mathematics discussions in two US high school classrooms. Through the lenses of turn-taking organizations and epistemic dimensions from conversation analysis, this study details the interactional features of turn-taking by three Black students in predominantly White classrooms. The analysis shows the importance of establishing epistemic congruence about the nature of students’ knowledge before inviting them to take up the conversational floor. The findings imply that locally achieved, mutual understanding of what minoritized students know in the moment-by-moment classroom interaction is an important interactional feature for making minoritized students’ brilliance more visible during whole-class discussions.</p>

We argue that attending to “slow emergencies” of racism must avoid sustaining mathematics education as a self-evident cause and cure for societal problems. We analyze how declarations of emergency reanimate racializing hierarchies by reordering spaces, temporalities, and subjectivities. To explore these concerns, we compare three race-explicit emergency declarations in US mathematics education during World War II with recent emergency declarations of pandemic-related learning loss, disengagement, and a racial reckoning. We juxtapose past and present to spotlight what we outline as distinct biopolitical working arrangements. The analysis maps how emergency declarations rearrange hopes, fears, diagnostic techniques, and intervention strategies—sometimes inadvertently reracializing students in attesting to damage or demanding redress. Our purpose is to foster deliberation over paradoxes and possibilities of addressing racialization and racism in mathematics education transnationally.</p>
