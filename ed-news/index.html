          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The recent spike in book challenges has put school libraries at the center of heated political debates. I investigate the relationship between local politics and school library collections using data on books with controversial content from a sample of 6,631 public school libraries. Libraries in conservative areas have fewer titles with LGBTQ, race/racism, or abortion content and more Christian fiction and discontinued Dr. Seuss books. This is true even though most libraries have at least some controversial content. State laws that restrict curricular content are negatively related to access to some LGBTQ and race/racism titles. Finally, I present short-term evidence that book challenges in the 2021–22 school year are associated with decreases in the acquisition of new LGBTQ materials.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined the impact of ITV intervention on reduction in the propensity to abuse substances and engage in drug trafficking. The researcher conducted this study using an experiment of 517 vulnerable adolescents aged 10–19 years. The participants were randomly assigned to control (n = 258) and treatment (n = 259) groups. The researchers found a significant main effect of treatment conditions on reduction in the propensity to engage in substance abuse and drug trafficking among vulnerable adolescents. That is, before the intervention, there was no significant statistical difference between the control and treatment groups on the propensity to engage in substance abuse and drug trafficking. However, vulnerable children who received the intervention reported a significant reduction in propensity after the intervention. The results highlight the usefulness of ITV as a behaviour change strategy for vulnerable children.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This qualitative, embedded single case study provides a rich description exploring the evolution of preservice teachers’ intention to use and actual use of technology-enabled learning (TEL) during student teaching. The study followed four middle-level education majors at a mid-size public teaching university in the southeastern United States during their student teaching experience (spring 2021). Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) guided this qualitative inquiry. Interviews, observations, and analysis of teaching artifacts (e.g., lesson plans, lesson reflections, and TEL artifacts) were conducted to support data triangulation. In addition to applying theory-based qualitative codes to the data, open coding was conducted to identify themes across the body of evidence. Findings extended previous TPB research regarding preservice teachers’ intention to use TEL in application use cases and yield practical implications for teacher educators seeking to increase TEL intention and use in preservice teacher populations.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports on the development and validation process of a new measure—the College Mathematics Beliefs and Belonging (CMBB) survey. The CMBB provides a contemporary measurement of undergraduate students’ perceptions of their mathematical practices and reasoning, beliefs about mathematics, and sense of belonging in mathematics. Primarily first- and second-year undergraduate students in five mathematics courses at a large public university in the United States completed multiple surveys to provide the data used for survey development. Confirmatory factor analysis (N = 935) along with additional psychometric evidence detailed here indicate that the CMBB is a survey with fifteen factors that adequately measure various aspects of perceived mathematical practices and reasoning, beliefs, and sense of belonging. The CMBB survey is intended for use by researchers and instructors to assess undergraduate students’ perceptions across these three domains with the aim of improving students’ experiences in college mathematics courses.</p>

For our study, we interviewed ten mathematicians to determine how experts conceptualize differentials presented in multiple mathematical contexts, such as differentiation, integration, and differential equations. Using thematic analysis, we analyzed their responses and found that our interview subjects’ conceptualizations were likewise many and varied, with many different interpretations offered for the same differentials. In this paper, we present results from our study and the initial classification system that emerged from this data, while understanding that ongoing and future research may expand and deepen our initial classification system.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims at defining and exploring design principles in a distance technological setting for an educational activity for mathematics undergraduate students, devoted to the construction of basic concepts in general topology, the promotion of problem-solving processes, the development of metacognitive aspects, and, in general, the development of the students’ mathematical identity. The design exploits the production of examples and investigation of variations and invariants, exploration of problems and generation of conjectures, and an extension intertwining of the ‘inside-out’ model from the Digital Interactive Storytelling in Mathematics with the Thinking Classroom model at university education. We present a didactic activity based on the identified design principles and discuss the preliminary results of a pilot carried out with fifty mathematics undergraduate students, attending their second year of the mathematics degree.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The surge of AI in education raises concerns about measurement downsides. Calls for clear standards are warranted. Fortunately, the psychometrics field has a long history of developing relevant standards—like sample invariance and item bias avoidance—crucial for reliable, valid, and interpretable assessments. This established body of knowledge, not unlike traffic laws for self-driving cars, should guide AI assessment development. Measuring new constructs necessitates stronger construct validity research. Instead of rewriting the rulebook, our focus should be on educating AI developers about these standards. This commentary specifically addresses the concern of empowering instructors not with high-stakes testing but with effective item writing through AI. We explore the potential of AI to transform item development, a key area highlighted by researchers. While AI tools offer exciting possibilities for tackling educational challenges, equipping instructors to leverage them effectively remains paramount.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Attribute hierarchies are commonly assumed to exist in many fields of psychological and educational assessment. Several theory-driven and data-driven approaches have been used to validate or explore attribute hierarchies, such as validating attribute hierarchies in the cognitive diagnostic model (CDM) through statistical hypothesis testing or even learning attribute hierarchies directly from data. A class of structural parameter standard error estimation methods for CDMs is useful for exploring attribute hierarchies, with the limitation that the information matrices of some model parameters may be unstable or singular, leading to biased hypothesis testing. An iterative method of attribute hierarchy testing was proposed to modify the original z-statistic method. The simulation study systematically compares the performance of the z-statistic and the iterative z-statistic in exploring the attribute hierarchy. The results show that the iterative z-statistic provides a better Type I error control rate and statistical power, and it partially solves the problem that the z-statistic is too conservative. In addition, the iterative z-statistic method also achieves satisfactory results on real data.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>In this qualitative study, researchers used critical race theory to examine the experiences of social studies standards committee members in 18 states and the District of Columbia. They found that while many participants articulated goals of increasing the teaching of race and racism in their state’s social studies standards, at least in part, numerous silent covenants and structural barriers existed to maintain the status quo through race-evasive standards. A smaller group of participants generally avoided advocating for race and racism topics altogether due to their perceived controversial or political status, while others did not mention race or racism as a priority. Recommendations are made for both the policy and practice related to state standards creation, and questions are raised about the ability of social studies standards to foster a racially just social studies curriculum.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>School discipline is a salient problem of educational policy and practice. Teachers play an important role in the production and disruption of racial inequities in school discipline, yet there remains a need to disentangle the relationship between teacher characteristics, their perceptions of school climate, and school discipline patterns. This study uses longitudinal data representing over one thousand public middle and high schools in New York City and linear regression methods to examine the relationship between teachers’ perceptions of school climate, teacher characteristics, and the rates of and disparities in suspensions. Overall, results indicate more positive teacher perceptions of school climate, higher years of teaching experience, and a greater share of Black teachers are independently associated with lower rates of office referrals and suspensions, overall and especially for Black and Latinx students. The study concludes by discussing implications for teacher education and on-the-job support as well as school leadership.

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Saturday, 10. August 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Globally, enduring skepticism around professionalism in education systems has questioned the efficiency in which teachers meet students’ educational needs and their authority to do so. Presently, efforts toward professionalization in teacher education (TE) are threatened by neoliberal reforms promoting alternative pathways into teaching and performance-based accountability mechanisms to monitor teachers and schools. In the face of public mistrust and external threats, this conceptual paper aims to envision the future of TE in light of the complexities inherent to the notion of professionalism. To this end, two competing ideals of teaching, which represent co-existing conceptions of professional work in education are examined: The teacher as an expert clinician ideal entrenched in expertise-driven professionalism and the teacher as a democratic pedagogue grounded in democratic professionalism. I offer ways in which these competing discourses could be fused to set the discussion about professionalism in teaching and its implications for TE on firmer grounds.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Policymakers and researchers carry a significant responsibility to foster environments and opportunities that authentically enhance migrants’ sociopolitical involvement in host societies. Incorporating participatory action research methods, such as photovoice, is crucial to amplify migrants’ voices and experiences. This scoping review investigates the implementation of photovoice projects with migrant and refugee populations, as well as their impact on empowerment. Following PRISMA guidelines, 65 articles published from 2000 to 2020 were analysed. The findings indicate that photovoice can serve as a potent tool for fostering intrapersonal, interpersonal and citizenship levels of empowerment. However, key epistemological and methodological considerations must be upheld to promote profound levels of empowerment.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The U.S. education system has been a critical site in the nation’s ongoing fight for racial equity. Yet, despite many attempts to promote equity within and across schools, efforts fall short in a system designed to uphold norms rooted in whiteness and white supremacy. We need anti-racist educational leaders who can identify and push back at the racial bias embedded in educational policies. Through a research-practice partnership with a Midwestern high school, we sought to understand how an anti-racist policy decision-making protocol can be used to redress inequitable policies to be racially just. The anti-racist policy decision-making protocol promotes social justice by empowering school practitioners to become policy agents. Implications from our findings point to the need for school practitioners to be critically introspective and identify and directly address the politics of whiteness that can ensue when working in partnership to do anti-racist policy change.

          Abstract
                  <p>Clear learning goals are an integral part of instructional clarity and seen as a factor influencing students’ motivation and learning processes. However, goal communication and the types of goals teachers set are rarely addressed in classroom studies. To further the understanding of these aspects, the purpose of this study was to investigate communicated learning goals in 146 videotaped lessons across 48 Nordic lower-secondary mathematics classrooms. A two-step analysis focusing goal clarity and types of communicated goals was applied to the data. Analyses indicated that the goals were often implicit and vague, and mostly focused on content and procedural skills, rather than on mathematical competencies and applications of mathematics. We conclude that the focus on content and procedures, coupled with implicit learning goals, could obscure the purpose of a lesson.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Education policy has long been analyzed as a cycle where various actors influence different stages. However, few such studies have focused on identifying and interrogating the specific moments that shape an education policy’s overall equity trajectory. This article uses Bowe, Ball, and Gold’s policy cycle as an exploratory theoretical framework, focusing on the historic Review of Funding for Schooling (2011) in Australia, which evaluated the nation’s school funding policy. The authors concentrate on the Context of Text Production phase of its policymaking process, and consider the implications for equity. From this work, the authors highlight two “critical moments” that they argue significantly influenced how the appointed panel approached equity. Their theorizing of a “critical moment” offers valuable insights for researchers and stakeholders seeking to understand or influence education policy.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Given today’s crisis-laden context filled with educational challenges, it is critical to understand how principals express hope through their leadership to navigate these challenges. Through an extensive qualitative research study conducted in 2019–2022, I examined how 50 principals expressed and used hope in varying degrees to hinder or facilitate increased outcomes, inclusivity, and stable recovery post-crisis to design a better future for their school communities. In so doing, I describe (a) how the context in which principals lead lends itself to expressing high- or low-hope leadership attributes; (b) principals’ expressions of high-hope leadership during and post-crisis; and (c) principals’ expressions of low-hope leadership during and post-crisis. Identifying expressions of hope leadership practices with the potential to cultivate inclusive, equitable school climates proves vital, given the complexity of leadership today and the myriad crises leaders face.
