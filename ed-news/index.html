          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this project was to conduct a theoretical literature review of the research that has documented examples of teachers’ principled resistance to curricular control. Principled resistance occurs when teachers reject curricular policies and programs that control their work and conflict with their professional principles. The authors examined the pedagogical commitments that led to teachers’ principled resistance and drew upon Lacey’s and Sikes et al.’s model of teacher socialization to analyze how teachers have engaged in principled resistance. The authors located 62 studies published between 1984 and 2022. Teachers resisted forms of neoliberal curricular control they believed did not meet their students’ academic and social needs, most negatively impacted ethnically diverse and impoverished students, and was not culturally responsive. Teachers enacted principled resistance through strategic compliance, strategic compromise, strategic redefinition, overt and outright resistance, and leaving. Implications for researchers, school administrators, policymakers, and teachers are discussed.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item compromise has long posed challenges in educational measurement, jeopardizing both test validity and test security of continuous tests. Detecting compromised items is therefore crucial to address this concern. The present literature on compromised item detection reveals two notable gaps: First, the majority of existing methods are based upon a non-Bayesian framework; second, many of these approaches exclusively rely on examinees’ responses for detection, neglecting valuable data such as response times. In this study, we propose a Bayesian change-point method that integrates both responses and response times to detect compromised items in continuous tests. This two-phase approach is designed for iterative use. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are assessed in three simulations and an operational data example. The results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in accurately and efficiently detecting compromised items. Additionally, the incorporation of response times significantly enhances both detection accuracy and efficiency.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Amidst chronic disparities in per-student resources, how best to construct funding formulas to equitably fund colleges and universities is an enduring policy concern. This brief focuses on a historically overlooked financial mechanism, categorical funding, to examine its role in funding (in)equity. Leveraging illustrative data from four equity-oriented categorical programs in the United States’s largest community college system, this study suggests extant funding formulas yield more per-student resources to institutions who serve the fewest students. The largest gaps in funding are associated with key funding formula mechanisms, including base allocations and funding guarantees. Policymakers should consider the tradeoffs when constructing funding policy, as even funds earmarked for equitable purposes may not be allocated in an equitable manner.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines interactions between educational systems and environments, focusing on the stance leaders take toward instructional guidance in their environment. After analyzing interview and focus group data from 49 school and system leaders across three systems (i.e., Montessori, International Baccalaureate, Catholic), we found differences by system in leaders’ stances toward their environment. These stances provided context for the educational infrastructure of each system and for the challenges leaders faced. Rather than taking it as a given that instructional practice is loosely coupled to educational policy, these findings help to illuminate a variety of relationships between systems, environments, and classroom practice, and suggest such variety has implications for school and system improvement.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The debate over race-conscious admissions has gained prominence, notably in cases such as Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. In debates on race-conscious admissions, the question is often not whether a student will go to college, but which college the student will attend. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we examined racial and socioeconomic disparities in the probability of acceptance to a student’s first-choice college based on institutional selectivity. Race was a significant predictor of acceptance to a first-choice college, with Black and Asian students facing odds of acceptance that were 46% to 59% lower than those of White peers. However, at highly competitive or most selective colleges, race was no longer a significant predictor, and racial disparities in acceptance rates diminished. Socioeconomic status had no significant association with the probability of acceptance to a first-choice college.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper presents restorative action research - a relational, collective, vital approach to fostering wellbeing. It is based on cooperative inquiry carried out by six academics over three years, for the purpose of enhancing their own wellbeing in the increasingly precarious world of higher education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the concept of “vital assemblages” as an analytical tool, the paper illustrates how restorative action research enhanced the participants’ sense of feeling alive, active, and joyful at a time of great stress. This relational, collective, vital approach to wellbeing offers an alternative to the dominant individualistic, internal framing of wellbeing. It is relevant to organizations outside of academia, as echoed in the idea of “networked wellbeing” emerging from the Global South. Restorative action research is also a political act with transformational potential, because it creates social spaces that enable people to free themselves and resist, if only a little, the influence of organizations and other dominant fields that cause illbeing and threaten human society.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In modern firms, conflicts may arise between the chief executive officer and board of directors due to the separation of ownership and operations. Such conflicts may weaken listed companies’ performance in the short term or affect their development in the long term. Using data on Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2022, this study empirically examines the impact of internal control quality on boardroom backscratching. We find that internal control quality significantly mitigates boardroom backscratching by reducing agency costs and increasing analyst attention. This effect is more significant in firms where the management holds less power and the product market is highly competitive. Furthermore, the mitigating effects of internal control quality on boardroom backscratching effectively reduce the risk of the company’s share price collapsing. Overall, this study enriches the literature on boardroom backscratching and internal control quality, and provides valuable references for stakeholders, including listed companies, to improve firm governance efficiency and, thus, maintain the stability of capital markets.

          Abstract
                    <p>Recent research in university mathematics education has moved beyond the traditional focus on the transition from secondary to tertiary education and students' understanding of introductory courses such as pre-calculus and calculus. There is growing interest in the challenges students face as they move into more advanced mathematics courses that require a shift toward formal reasoning, proof, modeling, and problem-solving skills. This survey paper explores emerging trends and innovations in the field, focusing on three key areas: innovations in teaching and learning advanced mathematical topics, transitions between different levels and contexts of mathematics education, and the role of proof and proving in advanced university mathematics. The survey reflects the evolving landscape of mathematics education research and addresses the theoretical and practical challenges of teaching and learning advanced mathematics across various contexts.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>While natural language documents, such as intervention transcripts and participant writing samples, can provide highly nuanced insights into educational and psychological constructs, researchers often find these materials difficult and expensive to analyze. Recent developments in machine learning, however, have allowed social scientists to harness the power of artificial intelligence for complex data categorization tasks. One approach, supervised learning, supports high-performance categorization yet still requires a large, hand-labeled training corpus, which can be costly. An alternative approach—zero- and few-shot classification with pretrained large language models—offers a cheaper, compelling alternative. This article considers the application of zero-shot and few-shot classification in educational research. We provide an overview of large language models, a step-by-step tutorial on using the Python openai package for zero-shot and few-shot classification, and a discussion of relevant research considerations for social scientists.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher resilience literature has expanded rapidly with a large number of publications and an evolving knowledge base. To capture a synthetic account systematically and effectively, this review provides a bibliometric approach to quantitatively examine the metadata of 692 relevant publications during the 26 years from 1998 to 2023.The finding traces the field’s progression from an initial concern for at-risk children to early conceptual discussions of resilience and, ultimately, more in-depth theoretical, empirical, and experimental investigations of teacher resilience, particularly within specific contexts like language teaching. However, the future trajectory of this domain remains an open question.The bibliometric review also enabled the researchers to anchor future research directions and contemplate the key challenges, such as the need for more international collaborations, concerted efforts to study teacher resilience across varied contexts, and the need to carefully balance productivity and influence when conducting new studies. Overall, this review aims to spark thoughtful discussions among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers regarding teacher resilience, in order to establish a more sustainable and global knowledge base.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The importance of the school environment in the development and achievement of youth has been well-documented. Racial inequities within the school environment may lead to differential schooling experiences and perceptions between racially minoritized youth and their White peers. Differences in school racial climate contribute to the achievement gap and impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite this understanding, school racial climate literature remains underemphasized due, in part, to the absence of a unifying model of school racial climate. The current article discusses the importance of school racial climate as conceptually distinct from school climate, provides an overview of existing literature across fields, and identifies factors for consideration in advancing school racial climate research.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study, using a scriptwriting task, examines how 52 Czech pre-service mathematics teachers (PMTs) handled a situation in which a fictional pupil’s incorrect reasoning resulted in a correct answer. The participants were asked to imagine and provide a script that reflects how the situation could evolve in response to the pupil’s incorrect reasoning with a correct answer (IRCA). We found some PMTs allowed the teacher in the scripts to take an active role in directing pupils to realize the IRCA and refute it through counter-examples. After orienting pupils, the teacher moved pupils’ thinking forward by foregrounding new strategies towards a more preferred strategy. However, some PMTs allowed pupils in the scripts to take more responsibility in recommending alternative strategies in response to the IRCA and justify the strategies. PMTs suggested teacher involvement or intervention in creating counter-examples considerably more frequently than letting pupils in the scripts provide alternative strategies and justifications. The results of the study highlight the important role of PMTs in harmonizing teaching strategies in their scripts with the curricular necessities and cognitive developments of pupils.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The rise of interest in data science raises questions about what changes may be needed in how we address the teaching of statistics with primary children. In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Standard item response theory (IRT) models are ill-equipped for when the probability of a correct response depends on the location in the test where an item is encountered—a phenomenon we refer to as position effects. Unmodeled position effects complicate comparing respondents taking the same test. We propose a position-sensitive IRT model that is a mixture of two item response functions, capturing the difference in response probability when the item is encountered early versus late in the test. The mixing proportion depends on item location and latent person-level characteristics, separating person and item contributions to position effects. We present simulation studies outlining various features of model performance and end with an application to a large-scale admissions test with observed position effects.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research incorporating either eye-tracking technology or immersive technology (virtual reality and 360 video) into studying teachers’ professional noticing is recent. Yet, such technologies allow a better understanding of the embodied nature of professional noticing. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine how teachers’ eye-gaze in immersive representations of practice correspond to their attending to children’s mathematics. Using a mixed methods approach, we incorporated eye-tracking technology embedded within a virtual reality environment to compare novice and expert teachers’ gaze duration with quality of professional noticing. Findings and results both corroborate and extend previous research evidence about important differences in professional noticing between expert and novice teachers. Specifically, the amount of experience, and thus familiarity, teachers have with being in a classroom may affect their physical movement in both real and virtual representations of practice. Additionally, findings and results emphasize the importance of teachers’ visual focus on students’ doing of mathematics across the classroom.</p>
