          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Traditionally, preservice teachers (PSTs) have been introduced and socialized to a cartoon of three children attempting to watch a baseball game as the prevailing definition of equity. Yet, in our sociopolitical context where Black, Brown, and LGBTQ+ children are continuously marginalized, we critique whether this simple construction of equity is sufficient. Rather, we build upon these understandings by outlining tenets of critical humanism and exploring the degree to which PSTs fluctuate between technical and humanist conceptualizations in their definitions of equal and equitable instruction. In this large-scale qualitative study using data collected between 2022 and 2024, we analyzed 1,528 PST responses about their conceptualizations of equity and equality. We found that PSTs harbor various conceptualizations of equity that are robust around resource-based teaching attributes such as materials, instruction, and accommodations. However, PSTs presented paradoxical understandings of equity related to treatment and opportunities, revealing tensions between technical and humanizing approaches to education.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Since 2020, legislators across the country have introduced bills aimed at banning instruction of Critical Race Theory in universities. This qualitative study examined 53 bills, most of which contained lists of “divisive concepts” that professors were prohibited from discussing in their classrooms. In addition, I analyzed 26 statements made by supporters of the bills that provided justification for the anti-CRT bans. The data exposed four Discourse Models upheld by these bills and their supporting statements using critical discourse analysis, tools developed by Gee, and legal analysis. The Discourse Models included Neoliberalism, Extreme Nationalism, Colorblindness, and Law as Morality.

          Abstract
                  <p>Examples play a variety of roles in proving and disproving. Buchbinder and Zaslavsky (2019) have produced an a priori mathematical framework for assessing students’ understanding of the role of examples when proving and disproving universal and existential statements. In this paper, I highlight three important aspects that suggest an extension of Buchbinder and Zaslavsky’s framework. These aspects arose a posteriori from research that had a focus on developing mathematically aligned assumptions related to proof and proving. To better approach students’ understanding of the role of examples in proving and disproving, these three aspects need to be explicitly included in the framework: (1) the size of the domain where universal and existential statements are defined, (2) the different forms of expression in which universal and existential statements can be presented, and (3) the quality of universal and existential statements. Illustrations of the development of in-service primary school teachers’ assumptions are given to show the emergence of these aspects and to support the extension of the existing framework.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Functional thinking has long been recognized as a crucial entry point into algebraic thinking in elementary school. This mixed-method study investigates the learning progression for elementary students’ functional thinking within the context of routine classroom instruction. Drawing on the existing research, a theoretical framework was constructed to assess the functional thinking of 649 students across grades 3 to 6. The framework includes three modes of functional thinking: recursive patterning, covariational thinking, and correspondence relations, each with particular and general layers of algebraic generality. Psychometric analysis was conducted to validate the assessment instrument. The study identifies a five-level learning progression of functional thinking: Pre-Structure, Pre-Functional Thinking, Emergent Functional Thinking, Specific Functional Thinking, and Condensed Functional Thinking. The distinctive characteristics of each level are identified and illustrated. Furthermore, the developmental sequence of different functional thinking modes within this learning progression is analyzed. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of these findings are examined.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Thursday, 30. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we are interested in a dynamic vision of diagrams, focusing on their evocative power, their force in mathematical activity and their potential for interaction with mathematical objects. We are inspired by the work of C. S. Pierce to see diagrams as inscriptions that organise space and articulate relations and that of the philosopher of mathematics G. Châtelet that emphasises diagrams as the very means of ontogenesis. In particular, diagrams are sophisticated mathematical devices for thinking about and communicating mathematics. They have stories and purposes. Focus is on the use of diagrams in the mathematics classroom to tell stories in order to trigger narrative modes of thinking (a là Bruner) as part of the mathematical work. Through some examples from the written productions of students at different ages, we examine how the task of telling a story about a given diagram gives rise to multiple views of the diagram. We use this analysis to begin characterising ways in which the mathematical relationships embedded in a diagram acquire a character that is both affective and aesthetic and to suggest implications of such use of diagrams in and for mathematics education.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We study the impact of a bonus policy in Hawai‘i Public Schools that raised the salaries of all special education teachers by $10,000. We estimate that this policy reduced the proportion of vacant special education teaching positions relative to general education positions by 32% and the proportion of special education positions that were vacant or filled by an unlicensed teacher by 35%. These impacts were largest in historically hard-to-staff schools in which all teachers received additional bonuses. The policy did not have significant effects on special education teacher retention; instead, the impacts of the policy were driven almost entirely by an increase in the number of general education teachers in the state who moved into open special education teaching positions.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective df as proposed by Satterthwaite, specifically addressing scenarios where component df are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large df, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite’s framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson and Rust, as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants. Finally, the proposed adjustment also provides a correction to the estimate of the total variance in cases missing data have been replaced by multiple imputations such as in the case of plausible values in national and international large scale assessments.

          Abstract
                  <p>Several studies highlight teachers’ challenges when posing and analysing modelling problems, often due to the absence of tools supporting these professional tasks. Thus, an important question refers to the effect of implementing different training strategies on the ability of prospective teachers to pose and assess modelling problems. Our study involves a sample of 110 pre-service primary school teachers, divided into three groups. The first group received extensive theoretical and practical teacher training in mathematical modelling based on the proposal of the study and research paths for teacher education. The second group received intensive theoretical training based on a didactic guide outlining the characteristics of modelling problems. The third group, which acts as a reference group, solely relied on the information provided by the Spanish curriculum. All participants undertake the same experience, involving the redesign and analysis of three textbook word problems into modelling problems. The results shed light on teachers’ training needs and the effectiveness of the tools in enhancing their ability to pose and assess modelling tasks at the primary school level.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study provides key empirical evidence of how school principals manage crises, an important but understudied component of their role. Specifically, this paper explores the perspectives of school principals who served as hurricane emergency evacuation shelter managers to understand how they managed the crises that arose during shelter operations and the contextual factors, such as the lack of policies governing shelter management, that facilitated or impeded their ability to succeed in doing so. Our analyses established an ecological framework that blends principals’ managerial knowledge, skills, and training with the larger organizational systems in which crises occurred. Our findings demonstrate the need for improved alignment between the organizations principals serve and what is asked of them as civic leaders during crises.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Interdistrict choice has the potential to exacerbate or alleviate between-district segregation—an increasingly pervasive form of U.S. school segregation—by allowing students to attend schools in districts where they do not reside. Prior research concentrates on the effects of charter schooling on segregation within districts and counties. We used longitudinal enrollment and demographic data from Michigan to examine the impacts of both interdistrict and charter school choice on racial and economic segregation within and between districts in a single setting. We estimated these effects by leveraging between-grade differences in choice use within school systems and years. We confirmed findings from previous research that increases in charter school enrollment increase within-district racial and economic segregation. We also found that the effects of interdistrict choice on both within- and between-district segregation vary with the presence of charter schools.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Gold and stocks, which are conventionally regarded as a safe haven and risk assets, respectively, exhibit complex interrelationships, with significant implications for financial risk management. This paper builds on the sentiment categorization proposed by Liang et al. (2020) to distinguish between private and public sector sentiment. The construction of sentiment indices for both sectors aims to allow the exploration of the heterogeneous effects of these sector-specific sentiments on the gold–stock market linkages in China under different market conditions. The empirical results demonstrate a notable asymmetry in the impact of market sentiment between the public and private sectors, with distinct manifestations in stable versus highly volatile market environments. Specifically, positive sentiment in the public sector tends to diminish the safe-haven function of gold, whereas positive sentiment in the private sector tends to reinforce it. This disparity becomes particularly evident during periods of extreme market volatility. Our findings not only underscore the diverse impacts of market sentiment but also provide novel insights into the importance of incorporating sector-specific sentiment when devising hedging strategies for specific industries.

      </h3>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Zhu et al. proposed a person-fit method based on the neural network called machine learning person-fit method (MLP-F) and found promising improvements over some traditional methods. MLP-F relies on constructing an appropriate neural network and uses mean square error as a loss function of the neural network. The primary focus of this study is to explore the potential improvement in classifications by replacing mean squared error with cross-entropy. Additionally, the application of MLP-F requires the establishment of a large number of output nodes when dealing with numerous attributes in an exam. However, an excess of nodes in the output layer may diminish classification accuracy and escalate the demand for training data. This article introduces a novel neural network architecture designed to be more versatile and robust. The findings from the research indicate that utilizing a cross-entropy loss function and the new neural network architecture enhances the performance of MLP-F. Simulation studies, considering various aberrant behaviors, demonstrate that MLP-F is effective in identifying aberrant behaviors and particularly excels in shorter tests, showcasing its potential significance in classroom testing.

          Abstract
                  <p>Seriation, sorting and grouping are processes that children begin to use at an early age. These processes, related to classification, become more complex over time—when the nature of the objects to be classified becomes more complex, for example. This article aims to describe and analyze how children aged 3 to 5 years use classification processes. We characterize their mathematical activity by referencing the trio of processes described by Drouard (Drouard, Grand N 86:13–32, 2010)—seriation, sorting, and grouping—and observing which processes the children apply through their actions. The study set up an open-ended task where the children had to create a sorting method while playing “grocery store” by organizing food in the stalls according to their own criteria. The results showed that the children used complex actions, applying grouping and sorting processes. While some had difficulties recognizing and naming the attributes used in their classification system, others showed advanced skills and even created sub-groups.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>One central element in understanding the concept of function and developing functional thinking is the aspect of covariation. Covariation describes how the change in one quantity affects the other one. A lack of students’ understanding of covariation leads to errors and misconceptions. This is particularly evident in students’ interpretations of graphs, where covariation is needed to understand the data. Up to now, it is not sufficiently known how students capture covariation in contextual graphs representing data from real-world phenomena. Our study aims to identify secondary school students’ approaches when capturing change in contextual graphs and students’ use of approaches. In our study, 19 ninth graders were asked to describe the change of two graphs from different situational contexts. To get detailed insights into their process of capturing the change, we triangulated eye-tracking data with verbal protocols and stimulated recall interviews. We identified nine approaches that students used to capture change in contextual graphs, which can be grouped into four main types (pairs of values, section by section, holistically, and total change). Moreover, based on students’ use of approaches in the two tasks, we identified task characteristics that seem to be related to the approach used, such as the situational context and the type of graph. The findings thus mark a first step towards improving the teaching and learning of task-specific graph interpretation.</p>

To better understand how superintendent turnover is associated with student achievement, we collected data on school superintendent turnover in Florida and Texas spanning 2009–10 to 2017–18 school years. We conducted an event study difference-in-differences analysis to examine the dynamic relationship between superintendent turnover and student achievement. Student achievement decreases in the years after a superintendent turns over, though this relationship is small in magnitude (−0.015 standard deviation units). Superintendent turnover is most detrimental in urban school districts, districts enrolling more students, and districts with more concentrated student poverty, though these negative relationships can be partially explained by instability in the district that led to the superintendent’s departure.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>As education researchers continue to investigate policies at scale and across diverse contexts, scholars must develop a better understanding of mechanisms shaping policy effects. In this study, we use the case of a federal initiative allowing high school students to use the Pell Grant for dual enrollment to investigate how institutions’ capacities shaped policy efficacy. We find that colleges’ capacities for policy implementation depended on their pre-existing resources (“foundational capacity”), the resources to execute the policy given policy-induced constraints (“execution capacity”), and the resources to provide the target population with access to the policy (“provision capacity”). We contend that institutions that may benefit the most from equitable policies also have the least capacity to implement them.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, debates surrounding instruction related to Critical Race Theory (CRT) have proliferated across the United States, flamed by political actors and media pundits who ushered a heretofore largely academic concentration into the public sphere. In this study, we examine opinions of voters and parents of school-aged children regarding racism-related instruction in Missouri, a locus of anti-CRT legislative debate. We find that though voters and parents are less likely to support allowing CRT-related instruction in schools, both groups support the permissibility of institutional and systemic racism-focused instruction, despite overlap between the two curricular emphases. Conversely, voter preferences are predicted much more strongly by political ideology than are parent preferences. Together, these findings question the role of anti-CRT legislative aims.
