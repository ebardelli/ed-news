          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article considers the future of teacher education through researching the impact of encouraging cosmopolitan perspectives in an undergraduate children’s literature course for preservice teachers. The research question focuses on how preservice teachers respond to reading and dialoguing through a cosmopolitan lens. Reading literature through a cosmopolitan lens entails a reflexive consideration of personal convictions and a reflective openness to learning from the perspectives of others. The results of this study provide insights into how preservice teachers understood a cosmopolitan response. The results also highlight the need for further critical inquiry into how to invite greater reflexive consciousness and reflective openness to other perspectives in preparing teachers for a diverse society.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Full-service community schools are increasingly adopted as educational policy nationwide to transform educational institutions into community hubs, addressing racial and social disparities and countering deficit narratives related to marginalized youth and families. As the movement toward community schooling as an educational policy gains momentum, more research is needed to understand the complex process of conceptualizing such an initiative for racial equity. Spanning from the early planning stages to 3 years into the implementation of community schooling, this paper uncovers the tensions that emerge as school and district leaderships’ interpretation of the purpose of community schooling and root cause of racial inequity unveil conflicting conceptualizations of the community school initiative: community schooling rooted in neoliberal ideals of efficiency, coordination, and service choice, on one hand, and those rooted in more transformative approach with systemic reflection and change in classrooms, schools, and other institutions on the other.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Trauma studies scholars emphasize naming or acknowledging trauma to promote healing. In response to the recent political and curricular whiplash in the Commonwealth of Virginia, this paper investigates the prevalence and nature of traumagenic events in Virginia’s social studies standards. Data analysis suggests that conceptual insights from trauma studies literature are broadly applicable in the study of traumagenic events in social studies. The findings foreground the role of positionality in the study of traumagenic events and highlight the importance of active verbs and visible actors in acknowledging both trauma and healing in the standards. This paper concludes with a typology for examining collective trauma in social studies curricula and beyond.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers of color often work in schools with few colleagues from the same racial or ethnic background. This racial isolation may affect their work experiences and important job outcomes, including retention. Using longitudinal administrative and survey data, we investigate the degree to which Tennessee teachers who are more racially isolated are more likely to turn over. Accounting for other factors, we find that racially isolated Black teachers are more likely to leave their schools than less isolated teachers. This turnover is driven by transfers to a different district and exiting the profession altogether. Consistent with an explanation that isolated teachers’ work experiences differ, they also report less collaboration with colleagues and receive lower observation scores.

          Abstract
                  <p>Studies show that supporting argumentation in mathematics classrooms is challenging for teachers. This study reports on the experience of seven elementary and middle-school mathematics teachers in an afterschool classroom-based program where they had the opportunity to facilitate research sessions on students’ development of mathematical ideas and different types of reasoning and justification. The study examines the teachers’ support of argumentation as students work collaboratively on challenging mathematical tasks. The results describe pedagogical strategies teachers can use to support students’ development of valid mathematical arguments and types of mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) that influence teachers’ supporting efforts.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study investigated whether a restorative practice initiative improved school climate. The study presents findings from a cluster randomized, controlled trial conducted with 2,248 students from grades 5 to 12 (38% Black, 32% Hispanic) attending 18 schools in the U.S. Northeast. After 1 year of implementation, the experimental analyses of the whole-school initiative did not result in more positive perceptions of school climate for students in the intervention schools compared with students in the control schools. Correlational analyses were also conducted with student surveys in both intervention and control schools. Based on student report, restorative practice exposure in all 18 schools was associated with positive perceptions of the school climate. This suggests that initiatives may need to focus on fidelity of implementation and consistent implementation across more years for substantive school climate gains.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Thursday, 10. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In the modern educational landscape, the integration of gamification into hybrid learning environments has emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks for designing gamified hybrid courses and validating their impact on student outcomes. This paper proposes a design science-based approach to gamified course design in hybrid learning contexts. Drawing on the principles of design science research, we developed a framework for designing a gamified hybrid course curriculum that incorporates course content, activities, and assessments based on four elements of gamification (achievement elements, utilitarian value, hedonic benefits, and competition). To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a study with 294 students enrolled in a hybrid business course that implemented the proposed gamification framework. Our findings indicate that all gamification elements of our proposed gamified hybrid courses positively enhance student engagement, achievement, and satisfaction. Ultimately, this paper not only contributes to the ‘gamification in education’ literature by providing a comprehensive framework for designing engaging and effective hybrid courses but also proposes a roadmap for the application of design science to embed gamification in business course curriculum design within the context of modern hybrid learning environments.

          Abstract
                  <p>There is a need for middle school students to develop an understanding of square root as a functional relationship. Examining two continuously changing quantities with the square root relationship can promote students to engage in both covariational reasoning and correspondence reasoning. In this study, we conducted a small-scale, exploratory teaching experiment with one middle school student, Ivan. Ivan engaged in a task sequence examining the relation between two continuously changing distances, which had the potential to support the development of smooth covariational reasoning. We found that Ivan was able to examine the continuously changing quantities to reason covariationally, a meaningful accomplishment for a middle school student, and then leveraged his reasoning to develop a correspondence relation. We identify shifts in Ivan’s covariational reasoning as he constructed an understanding of the square root relationship, and discuss how covariational and correspondence reasoning can mutually support one another to engender functional thinking.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>The number of English learners (ELs) enrolled in public schools has grown substantially in the United States over the past two decades. The growth is especially large in states in the South and Midwest that have not been traditional destinations for recent immigrants. In this study, we examine the effects of new ELs on students in receiving schools in Delaware, which is one of the so-called new destination states. We find significant positive spillover effects in the short term of new ELs on the test scores of the other students in the receiving schools. The positive effects are mainly concentrated among current and former ELs.

          Abstract
                  <p>Proof is a central pillar of mathematical practice, and so teaching proof to undergraduate students is an important responsibility for undergraduate mathematics instructors. Our study contributes to research on one facet of this goal by examining instructors’ responses to student-generated existence proofs. Existing literature on the topic suggests that students might include unnecessary statements or utilize an unnecessary proof structure when writing existence proofs, even if a single confirming example would be sufficient. Instructors in our study

                  ) ranked five students’ existence proofs containing an unnecessary aspect; using the language of norms and professional obligations, we analyzed these rankings and the instructors’ corresponding justifications. We found that mathematics instructors are willing to accept proofs with an unnecessary aspect from students when doing so allowed the instructors to fulfill a professional obligation to an individual student, to mathematics as a discipline, or to their classroom as a space for collaborative and student-centered mathematics.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Teachers need technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) for teaching with technology, and its assessment is crucial for research and practice. Previous literature reviews on TPACK assessment were not specific to a content area (e.g., mathematics), although, by definition, the TPACK framework includes content-specific knowledge facets. Consequently, requirements for TPACK assessment could differ depending on the content. Further, reliable assessment of mathematics-specific TPACK depends on the quality of the test instruments used, but there is no consensus on the type of instruments used in past studies. This systematic literature review adds to existing reviews by focusing on TPACK assessment in mathematics, investigating the study characteristics, the instrument characteristics, and the operationalizations of TPACK. Regarding study characteristics, the findings reveal an increase in the number of studies conducted across various countries worldwide. As for instrument characteristics, researchers frequently used self-developed instruments to assess TPACK, often without providing information on reliability or validity measures. Regarding operationalizations, more than half of the studies used self-report scales to assess mathematics-specific TPACK, followed by observations and material analyses, while knowledge tests were hardly used. Additionally, assessments typically referred to the domain of mathematics as a whole instead of subdomains of mathematics. The results raise questions regarding the validity of the instruments and the comparability across studies.</p>

The heuristic highlights two features of antiblackness shaping the globalization of HE: anti-humanity and extraction.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research literature has provided considerable insight as to how young students might come to deeper understandings of statistical concepts, processes and representations through investigations. However, ‘data-ing’—the critical thinking aspects of decision-making while engaging in statistical investigations—has shown to be more difficult to grasp. Data-ing aspects of statistical investigations identified in literature as particularly challenging include: generating researchable questions, knowing when or how to apply statistical knowledge, seeing a need for evidence to support conclusions, and knowing how to use data as evidence. Argumentation practices necessitate a focus on the use of evidence to logically support a claim, thereby offering potential to focus students on the sufficiency and quality of evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn. As such, argumentation offers potential to support students to engage in data decision-making practices. In the research described here, an argumentation focus was used to guide a statistical investigation with a class of 9–10-year-old students in a suburban Australian school.
