          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent data show rising suicidality among high school girls. We posit this increase may be related to an overlooked factor: more girls identifying as LGBQ. Using four cohorts of national Youth Risk Behavior Survey data (N = 22,562 females, N = 22,130 males), we found that LGBQ identification among females rose from 15% in 2015 to 34% in 2021. LGBQ females consistently reported higher suicidality, although rates remained stable within both LGBQ and heterosexual groups. The rise in females’ suicidality may stem from social pressures faced by LGBQ youth. Male suicidality and LGBQ identification showed smaller changes. More support for LGBQ students is essential to address this trend.

          Abstract
                  <p>The reasons for teaching programming in school are indeed manifold. Programming can for example be utilized as a vehicle for understanding and learning particular mathematical subject matter, or as a tool for solving mathematical problems. In this paper, however, we propose to utilize programming as a vehicle for developing mathematical competencies such as problem-solving, exploration, modeling, reasoning, representation, generalization, and abstraction. We perform a design study utilizing a systematic, iterative development process for designing teaching sessions, focusing on one mathematical competence at a time. We apply the proposed methodology on a set of teaching sessions that are developed, implemented, and tested in a range of classroom settings. Based on this development process, we conclude that programming can be used to develop mathematical competencies. Furthermore, we identify a set of teacher practices that can be used to facilitate mathematical competence development in programming activities.</p>

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Monday, 13. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Feedback and preservice teachers’ (PSTs’) clinical practice/field experiences are vital for their learning. Understanding influences on field supervisors’ feedback is critical, especially for preparing dual language bilingual education (DLBE) teachers because it requires specialized knowledge—yet systematic guidelines and programs for DLBE teacher preparation are lacking. We conducted a collaborative autoethnography to determine how our identities and experiences with language and DLBE related to our feedback and supervision of DLBE PSTs. We analyzed and discussed the narratives we wrote about our experiences and the feedback we provided while supervising 13 Spanish–English bilingual PSTs in elementary DLBE classrooms. Our identities and experiences, which were influenced by families, education, language histories, geography, and sociopolitical contexts, influenced our feedback. Considering identities and experiences illuminates what is (sometimes unconsciously) prioritized and ignored in feedback. Engaging in deep reflection is important for continued support of supervisors and PSTs.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>In this philosophical paper, we argue that youth sports, both in and out of schools, are a largely unrealized space for democratic/civic education. Where youth sports leagues used to be low cost, local, and inclusive, much has changed over the last several decades. We are now in the neoliberal era of exclusive, privatized, and professionalized youth sports. Drawing on Dewey’s robust conception of democracy and Talisse’s concerns about partisan polarization, we argue that youth sports should be spaces to develop democratic habits, dispositions, and values. We explore the benefits of youth sports as well as current challenges, including excessive costs and pressure, disrupted families, and hyperindividualism. We end by offering suggestions for reforming youth sports to recenter their educational and democratic potential and value, including supporting loosely structured play, modeling democratic behavior, teaching democratic habits directly, and learning from more progressive national sports models.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Official development agencies are increasingly supporting civil society lobby and advocacy (L&amp;A) to address poverty and human rights. However, there are challenges in evaluating L&amp;A. As programme objectives are often to change policies or practices in a single institution like a Government Ministry, L&amp;A programmes are often not amenable to large-n impact evaluation methods. They often work in strategic partnerships to foster change; hence, contribution may be a more relevant evaluation question than attribution. Small-n qualitative approaches are available to measure the effectiveness of L&amp;A which use the theory of change as their analytical framework. We conducted a meta-evaluation of 36 evaluations of multi-component international programmes to support civil society L&amp;A across Asia, Africa and Latin America, comprising the majority of programmatic support from one international donor. We assessed the confidence in causal claims in the evaluations using a new tool that we developed. Assessments of the contribution of the programmes to the changes in outcomes were not provided in many of the evaluations, nor were predictable sources of bias addressed. Given that L&amp;A programmes are likely to adopt an influencing approach where many different inside-track and outside-track engagement objectives, opportunities and strategies are attempted, many of which might be expected to fail, there appeared to be a clear bias in the evaluations towards reporting outcomes that were achieved, ignoring those that were not. We provide guidance on how to improve the design, conduct and reporting of small-n qualitative evaluations of aid effectiveness.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Saturday, 11. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Inferentialism has emerged as a valuable theoretical resource in mathematics education. As a theory of meaning about the use and content of concepts, it offers a fresh perspective on traditional epistemological and linguistic questions in the field. Despite its emergence, important inferentialist ideas still need to be operationalized. In this paper, I operationalize multiple inferentialist concepts to analyze prospective secondary mathematics teachers’ learning about graphs and quantitative and covariational reasoning in a mathematics content course. I use Robert Brandom’s ideas about upstream, downstream, and incompatible inferences to illustrate the inferentialist mastering metaphor for learning and Brandom’s ideas about objectivity. My analysis shows (a) inferentialism’s capacity to address epistemological issues like objectivity and conceptual understanding, (b) the importance of attending to different types of inferences to assess learning from an inferentialist perspective, and (c) how the development of mastery is associated with virtues. I conclude by identifying the study’s potential limitations and trajectories for future research.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Novice teachers improve substantially in their first years on the job, but we know remarkably little about the nature of this skill development. Using data from Tennessee, we leverage a feature of the classroom observation protocol that asks school administrators to identify an item on which the teacher should focus their improvement efforts. This “area of refinement” overcomes a key measurement challenge endemic to inferring from classroom observation scores the development of specific teaching skills. We show that administrators disproportionately identify two skills when observing novice teachers: classroom management and presenting content. Struggling with classroom management, in particular, is associated with early career attrition. Using a returns to experience framework, we observe improvement in these skills among teachers who remain.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>The increasing prominence of dual-language bilingual education (DLBE) in the United States necessitates deeper understanding of institutional roles and professional identities of DLBE teachers, particularly when incongruent. We qualitatively analyzed teacher resistance in discordant situations as discussed in conferences between DLBE teachers and a bilingual instructional coach in two districts over 2 years. In these conversations, we found a distinction between nonconfrontational and open, direct resistance. We applied an agentive triad model of teacher identity, agency, and power to understand how DLBE teachers navigated discordant situations in their schools. Teachers acted from different identity positions, including agentive compliance, anagentive compliance (without agency), and nonconfrontational resistance. Findings and theorization demonstrate that DLBE programs present special considerations for teacher identity, role, and resistance. Moreover, context-specific characteristics, including program age, model, and administration, may impact teachers’ approach to resistance. Findings and theorization are relevant to successful DLBE program implementation and equity focused instructional coaching.

          Abstract
                  <p>Learning to launch problem-based lessons is challenging for prospective teachers (PTs). Teaching rehearsals offer an opportunity for PTs to practice launches in a controlled environment in which the action can be paused to discuss situations that arise. Typically, the teacher educator (TE) initiates the vast majority of these pauses, but in this study, the TE encouraged any PT to also initiate a pause in the action whenever they identified a potential learning opportunity for the class. We collected detailed data on each in-the-moment discussion in order to determine who initiates and participates in these discussions, how discussions initiated by the PTs and the TE differ in structure and substance, and whether PTs want to remember discussions with particular structures or substances. We found that over half of the discussions were initiated by PTs themselves. We also found that PTs across the class actively engaged in the in-the-moment discussions. Looking closer at the structure and substance of the discussions showed that the TE and PTs structured the discussions in similar ways, but there were some differences in the substance of those discussions. We also found that PTs were more likely to want to remember discussions they had initiated as well as those that were framed as highlighting a productive move.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In the contemporary educational landscape characterised by performativity pressures, schools face increasing scrutiny regarding their students’ mathematical outcomes. Inquiry-based approaches in mathematics education offer promising potential to enhance reasoning and problem-solving capabilities across diverse student populations. However, the transition from teacher-centred methodologies to student-centred, inquiry-based approaches presents significant challenges for educators. This scoping review examines reported professional learning approaches aimed at building teacher capacity in implementing inquiry-based mathematics instruction, with the potential to improve student engagement and interest in the subject. Here, capacity refers to a teacher’s ongoing professional ability to implement and effect change. The review provides insights into various hindrances to implementing inquiry-based learning, including the substantial time investment required, teachers’ confidence levels, and the challenge of shifting deeply ingrained pedagogical beliefs. Conversely, it identifies a range of supports for facilitating this pedagogical shift, with the ultimate goal of improving students’ mathematical outcomes. These supports include school-wide commitments to providing opportunities for teachers to actively collaborate with specialist educators and mentors within their institutions. Findings from this review underscore that the transition to inquiry-based approaches is a gradual process requiring sustained effort and commitment. The foundation for this shift lies in cultivating a school culture that acknowledges and addresses the complex needs of both teachers and leaders in implementing inquiry-based learning. This review contributes to the growing body of literature on professional development in mathematics education, offering valuable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to enhance mathematical instruction and student outcomes through inquiry-based approaches.</p>

The study of such problems in the frequentist tradition has thus far been restricted to an EM algorithm method using full numerical integration. However, under most missing data patterns, we show that this problem can be solved analytically, and numerical approximations are only needed under specific conditions. Thus we propose a hybrid EM algorithm, which uses analytic solutions when available and approximate solutions only when needed. The theoretical framework of our algorithm is described herein, along with three empirical experiments using both simulated and real data. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides greater estimation accuracy, exhibits robustness to distributional violations, and confers higher power to detect interaction effects. We conclude with a discussion of extensions and topics of further research.
