          Abstract
                  <p>Research literature has provided considerable insight as to how young students might come to deeper understandings of statistical concepts, processes and representations through investigations. However, ‘data-ing’—the critical thinking aspects of decision-making while engaging in statistical investigations—has shown to be more difficult to grasp. Data-ing aspects of statistical investigations identified in literature as particularly challenging include: generating researchable questions, knowing when or how to apply statistical knowledge, seeing a need for evidence to support conclusions, and knowing how to use data as evidence. Argumentation practices necessitate a focus on the use of evidence to logically support a claim, thereby offering potential to focus students on the sufficiency and quality of evidence and the conclusions that can be drawn. As such, argumentation offers potential to support students to engage in data decision-making practices. In the research described here, an argumentation focus was used to guide a statistical investigation with a class of 9–10-year-old students in a suburban Australian school. Analysis of classroom interactions and children's work samples suggested that taking an argument-based focus supported students’ developing capacity to overcome the aforementioned challenges and to engage in critical, decision-making practices with authentic, messy data within the context of the investigation.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Saturday, 05. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The ability to interpret and compare data distributions is an important educational goal. Inherent in the statistical concept of distribution is the need to focus not only on individual data points or small groups of data points (so-called local view), but to perceive a distribution as a whole, allowing to recognize global features such as center, spread, and shape (so-called global view). However, the latter is challenging for students to acquire. This study, involving 68 students in grades 4, 6, and 8, had two main objectives. First, we aimed to examine the potential impact of grade level on how students perceive and compare distributions presented in dot plots. Despite variations in specific pre-knowledge, our findings showed no significant grade-related differences in students’ gaze behavior or their ability to process global features when comparing distributions. This finding suggests that there is no significant developmental trend across grade levels regarding students’ capacity to perceive distributions globally, a critical aim in statistics education. Our second objective was to extend the findings of our previous work regarding the identification of specific eye-tracking measures as indicators of students’ local vs. global views. In line with our hypotheses, differences in gaze behavior between students with a local and global view were determined regardless of their grade level. This robustness across different educational stages underscores the validity of specific eye-tracking measures as reliable indicators for students local vs. global view of data. Our research highlights the potential of eye-tracking for understanding students’ data interpretation approaches in statistics education.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/13394'>Saturday, 05. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Classification of mathematics tasks has long been an important part of classroom assessment. The classification systems used in this context are based on different approaches and often make use of different categories of analysis. Comprehensive studies that examine these aspects in terms of their interrelationships, and thus shed light on the contribution of classification systems to research and practice, are of great benefit. The present study provides a systematic overview of classification systems for mathematics tasks (search period: 1956–2023; worldwide distribution). It includes 17 such classification systems developed between 1963 and 2019. These systems are analyzed with the help of a model developed here. On the one hand, this model focuses on the aspects of the use of the classification systems; on the other hand, it considers the theoretical basis and the components of the classification systems. The results show that early attempts to classify mathematics tasks were largely based on Bloom’s work. These classification systems were used to analyze test items from large-scale studies and were related to mathematical content. Since the 1990s, there has been a shift in emphasis in the use of classification systems, with a greater focus on tasks used in learning processes on the one hand, and on mathematical activities on the other. At the same time, there has been an increasing differentiation of the classification systems, allowing different aspects of mathematics learning to be captured.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The effectiveness of incorporating independent reading practice in schools has long been a subject of uncertainty. To shed light on this ongoing debate, this meta-analysis seeks to investigate the impact of in-school independent reading on three crucial measures—attitudes toward reading, word recognition, and comprehension—focusing on K–10 students. The analysis encompasses (quasi-)experimental studies conducted between 1970 and 2020, examining a total of 7,493 students across 47 studies. Because most studies contain more than one outcome measure or effect size, we used a meta-analytic model with a three-level structure. The findings reveal a statistically significant overall effect size (Hedges’ g = .08). Specifically, the effect sizes are more pronounced when considering word recognition (i.e., word attack, word identification, decoding, and fluency; Hedges’ g = .21) and students’ reading attitude (Hedges’ g = .18) as outcome measures. However, the effect size for comprehension—the most commonly assessed outcome measure—was approximately zero (Hedges’ g = −.014).

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Friday, 04. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>As one of the three broad types of test cheating, item preknowledge has always been a severe threat to test validity and is widespread in various testing programs, especially within some high-volume certification testing programs. While many response-based methods have been proposed to identify and handle item preknowledge, most require the assumption that the compromised items are known. Moreover, few studies have considered that both examinee and item characteristics might affect this cheating behavior, and even fewer have considered the relationship between ability and such behavior when estimating ability. Therefore, this article proposes a mixture model with less strict assumptions on the compromised items. By modeling cheating behavior with a latent response approach, the model takes into account the effect of both characteristics at the item-by-examinee level and assesses how a person’s ability relates to such behavior. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be effectively recovered, and when data contains item preknowledge, the model generally produces more accurate ability estimates than existing models. Finally, an empirical example based on a licensure test dataset illustrates the applicability of the new model.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Friday, 04. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The study reported in this paper contributes to the literature on prospective teachers’ decision making, specifically regarding how they analyze and make informed decisions about the use of their textbooks. We designed a training intervention with 28 future Costa Rican teachers, in which they had to identify and manage semiotic conflicts that can be found in a textbook lesson. For this purpose, we selected a lesson on proportionality from a textbook commonly used in Costa Rica. We performed an interpretive and exploratory content analysis of teachers’ responses to the textbook lesson assessment tasks. The results show that participants progressed in identifying semiotic conflicts and could produce effective solutions for some of the detected semiotic conflicts. The prospective teachers reflected on the way they used the lesson by proposing improvements in more than one facet (epistemic, cognitive, affective, interactional, mediational, and ecological). We conclude that the training provided allowed the participants to progress in decision making regarding the use of the textbook lesson, although it is necessary to reinforce their didactic-mathematical knowledge on proportionality so that they can develop more critical and well-founded analyses.</p>

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 8-13, October 2024. <br>Transforming schools through mastery learning may solve education's existential crisis, offering today’s learners the relevance and individualization they need while returning to the most ancient form of assessment, proving that learning has occurred. Mastery learning requires significant change to all the norms and practices of school, altering time, space, culture, technologies, and pedagogies. Ira David Socol and Pam Moran share how, in Virginia, Kentucky, and Nevada, statewide innovation networks provide schools with the support, coaching, and peer encouragement required for sustainable change. Backed by both public and private organizations, these networks meet in-person and virtually, work synchronously and asynchronously, and communicate with stakeholders to build fundamental change.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 14-18, October 2024. <br>A mastery-based learning model has limited value in secondary English classrooms, particularly as it relates to writing instruction. Kelsey Hammond and Chelsey Barber argue against the focus on standardized benchmarks that are tied to mastery-based models in favor of an approach to writing that is explorative, personal, and imaginative. The rise of artificial intelligence writing tools like ChatGPT further challenge the traditional mastery paradigm by replicating formulaic writing tasks. The authors advocate for a shift toward fostering self-actualization, empathy, and creative expression in students, emphasizing writing as a means of personal growth and social discourse rather than a mere demonstration of skill.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 28-33, October 2024. <br>Demetrius Fuller developed the HOMies, eight characters who represent eight habits of mind for learners, while he was an art teacher at a Massachusetts elementary school. When students began talking about the HOMies outside their art class, the initiative spread across the school. Linda Nathan, Demetrius Fuller, and Nate Meyers describe the HOMies and unpack the key ingredients involved in scaling a good classroom practice throughout an entire school. They look at the role of involving teachers from different subject areas and with different perspectives in the program. This example shows how teachers and leaders can ensure that innovative ideas can be shared and sustained so that schools can continually evolve to find ways to meet student needs.

Authors Brendan Sheran, Ashley Carey, Jack Schneider, Rebecca Woodland, and Kathryn McDermott, who are affiliated with Center for Education Policy (CEP) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, outline a process called deliberative polling. They used this process of bringing citizens together in a structured way to deliver information and allow for questions and discussion in their Civic Summit. The event, in which Massachusetts citizens discussed the pros and cons of an upcoming state ballot measure on high school graduation exams, was an example of how a summit can bring people together to discuss, safety ask questions, and debate education issues.

A principal needs help dealing with a teacher giving him the silent treatment because he couldn’t accommodate a request from her.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 20-23, October 2024. <br>Some students learn better if they can apply skills and knowledge to their lives. Youth apprenticeships are a way for students to work and gain skills in a chosen career field and earn money while still in high school. Youth apprenticeships are on a continuum of work-based learning that includes job shadowing and internships. Apprenticeships require a yearlong commitment from the students and employers, and students often graduate from high school with career credentials and college credits. Schools and employers must work together to make the experience a success for all participants.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 42-46, October 2024. <br>The promotion and measurement of standards in compulsory education systems has been a prominent feature of Western education systems for centuries. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) have made the limits of current standards-based approaches to assessment more evident. Louis Volante, Don A. Klinger, and Christopher DeLuca discuss the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills for the future success of schools. More authentic assessments, some of which leverage AI, can assess students’ performance in these essential domains.
