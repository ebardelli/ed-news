          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>It is a much-lamented fact that research with the potential to inform or influence education policy instead remains policy inert. There are many reasons for this frustrating state of affairs, including a lack of strategic thinking on the part of researchers on how to successfully accomplish outreach—as opposed to communication with peers (in-reach). Another, and a principal focus of this article, is the failure of researchers to appreciate the power of employing compelling narratives to bring their findings to the attention of policymakers and other stakeholders. Accordingly, this article presents some examples of narratives specifically designed for outreach and discusses some of their features. It also considers the challenges in gaining traction with counternarratives once a particular narrative has achieved currency. Researchers should also be mindful of the tenor of the times, with experts now often viewed with skepticism, if not downright hostility. In some quarters, excessive reliance on technocrats is even seen as a threat to democratic governance. The article concludes with some recommendations on how to appropriately enhance the role of research in education policymaking.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>White supremacy and anti-Black racism are deeply embedded in educational organizations and disrupting them is key to creating more racially just schools. This essay details how the regular practice of organizational routines reproduces racial domination and subordination. We argue that combining critical perspectives on race with organizational improvement approaches can help disrupt this reproductive process. More specifically, educators can engage in critical reflection and action to interrupt, deconstruct, and redesign organizational routines in ways that challenge and hopefully undermine white supremacy and anti-Black racism in schools. We highlight how this approach could help create more racially just educational contexts.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this critical race discourse analysis of legal documents and correspondence, we discuss how a small number of highly organized and visible groups of Asian American parent activists oppose admissions policy reforms intended to diversify student enrollment to specialized high schools. We identify two narratives deployed by this vocal minority: anti-Asian discrimination and Asian American exceptionalism. These narratives prioritize the historical and interpersonal racialized experiences of Asian Americans over institutionalized racial inequality experienced by Black students, namely, residential housing and school segregation. By valorizing Asian American exceptionalism and meritocracy, these claims relegate racism as a historical problem, mirroring ideologies of white supremacy and anti-Blackness while reconstituting anti-racism.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, we argue for the value of theorizing antiblackness to educational justice efforts, particularly those aimed at ensuring Black students succeed and thrive in schools. We first define antiblackness and describe how a frame of antiblackness can help to illuminate ongoing dehumanization and violence done to Black people in schools and society. We explain how antiblackness manifests in education before describing the potential of three strategies for dismantling antiblackness: abolishing, renarrativizing, and revaluing. Ultimately, we argue that antiblackness theorizing does critical work that, in combination with other traditions in antiracist scholarship and activism, can contribute to Black liberation and racial justice through education.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study considers the degree to which attendance policies and practices to address chronic absenteeism in a large Midwestern urban school district create suffering in Black parents’ experiences. In a secondary analysis of longitudinal qualitative data conducted through Afro-pessimist conceptualizations of anti-Blackness, we found that the district’s attendance policies antagonize Black parents in ways that create psychological and material distress; and that educators characterize Black parents as problems they must overcome. These findings demonstrate how attendance policies and practices are imbricated in anti-Black social processes, inviting social death into Black family life. In the ongoing struggle to realize Black freedom, the paper calls for abandoning incentivize-and-punish approaches that assume Black parents and students are inadequately committed to schooling.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 29. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The presence of armed police officers in schools has sparked considerable policy debate and demands for reform. Thus far, much of the debate has centered on an empirical analysis of school resource officers rather than school police officers and their impact on particular student populations, especially those burdened by their greater vulnerability to punitive interactions such as detention and arrest. In this article the authors show that an examination of the data reveals that interactions between students and police follow distinct patterns with respect to race and geographic space. The authors use the “sociospatial dialectic” method to explain why certain student populations are most vulnerable to negative interactions with school police within particular spatial settings. Oral history interviews with 120 Black students in a large urban public school district reveal two self-reinforcing pathways: (1) soft coercion, when care and courtesy meet preemptive criminalization to produce punitive policing, and (2) shielding, when referrals to school police officers by school personnel shift blame onto students and invite the use of punitive policing without care. These findings underscore the racialized and contextually specific nature of school policing’s social and spatial processes for Black students in low-income communities.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State educational agency content coordinators commonly experience tensions in their professional roles related to distinct sets of beliefs, or logics, about who “should” control what students learn: the state bureaucracy, the local community, or the broader profession. Using an institutional logics frame and drawing on interviews with coordinators for English/language arts representing about a third of U.S. states, we illustrate how individuals navigate these competing traditions of decision-making. Multiple logics shaped coordinators’ perceptions of their job responsibilities and goals, as well as the actions they felt were possible for them to take in creating and providing resources, communicating those resources to local stakeholders, and providing professional development. More consistent messaging to coordinators about the types of outreach the state views as acceptable would better support high-quality literacy instruction.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study aims to analyze possible connections among the noticing skills of pre-service mathematics teachers, and specifically the skills of attending to students’ thinking, interpreting students’ mathematical understanding, and proposing teaching alternatives. We characterized these connections in terms of coherency, i.e., the extent to which pre-service teachers take into account (a) an identified critical event—including its mathematics and context—when interpreting students’ statements, (b) their own interpretation of students’ statements when interpreting the teacher’s response, and (c) their own interpretation of students’ statements when proposing alternative teaching strategies. The construct of coherency evolved during our attempts to analyze pre-service teachers’ interpretations of the critical events they identified while observing mathematics lessons as part of their preparation program. In this paper, we elucidate the construct of coherency and its different levels and demonstrate how this construct relies upon and expands existing ideas from the literature on noticing. We propose a framework for identifying different coherency levels and the different patterns identified when using the framework to noticing among the pre-service teachers. Some of these patterns are supported by previous research, while others were unanticipated. We explore possible explanations for the emergence of these unanticipated patterns.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Truth and its consequences in teacher education form a web of interconnected relationships that align our attentions with our intentions. This article responds to an essay I wrote twenty years ago, and I examine the assumptions, questions, and possibilities in the frame of a more modern context. While many of the ideas remain salient, an examination of the truths I explained and the consequences I examined have shed new light on what truths and consequences for teacher education have unfolded in the last two decades.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>As a high-energy-consuming sector, China’s light sector should have received more attention for its carbon emissions (CO2e). However, the literature on energy-related CO2e in China’s light sector is limited at present. This paper aims to assess the impact of China’s light sector on CO2e. This paper applies the energy consumption technique, input-output analysis technique, and structural decomposition model to analyze China’s light sector energy-related CO2e and emission reduction from the input-output perspective. The results show that the energy structure effect, energy intensity effect, and input structure effect are the main restraining factors for the growth of the light sector energy-related CO2e, which are caused by the expansion of the energy utilization structure on the supply side of the light sector. The final demand effect is the factor promoting the growth of the light sector energy-related CO2e. It reveals that the final demand products in the light sector still have high environmental degradation features. Policymakers should actively enhance and rationally adjust the demand for the light sector in numerous industries to avoid the resource waste caused by the excessive expansion of the light sector.

          Abstract
                  <p>Describing mathematics classroom teaching and learning is part of a professional expertise. Comparing ‘our distinct stories’ and ‘our professional languages’ about teaching and learning in mathematics classes around the world, reveals cultural and linguistic underpinnings of our ‘stories’ and ‘languages’. Analysing and understanding these ‘stories’ and ‘languages’ in the form of narratives of classroom lessons, is a methodological approach that allows us to study and compare language as a resource across different cultural and linguistic contexts. We based our approach on results of the Lexicon Project, which set out to document the terms and the professional vocabulary that teachers use for describing the phenomena of middle school mathematics classrooms around the world, but enlarged this approach by narratives and a narrative methodology. Our cultural comparative approach based on these narratives revealed not only technical terms that define and make explicit didactical intentions, techniques and approaches, but also offered narrative descriptions of the enactment of the didactic intentions and techniques in situ. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the potential of language and turned out to be valuable for understanding how language orients teachers’ visions and analyses of mathematics classrooms.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Texas reduced new teacher preparation requirements in 2001 to allow more alternate paths to licensure. Within 5 years, this policy change resulted in more than half of the state’s new teachers being alternatively licensed. Using a series of first difference models, this study examines the relationship between the increased supply of new teachers in Texas and new teacher salaries prior to the policy change and in the 15 years thereafter. We find that the policy change did increase the supply of new teachers via alternative licensing, but pay for new EC-6 teachers declined by 2%–13% with differential effects based on the rate at which districts hired alternatively licensed teachers.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Climbing the ladder of institutional prestige is often promoted by leaders and policymakers in higher education, but there may be trade-offs associated with striving for status. This study examines the impact of Texas’s National Research University Fund (NRUF), which uses financial incentives to support institutions’ pursuit of prestige, on the salaries and employment of faculty. For full professors, the NRUF had a positive effect on the salaries of both men and women, but the policy also contributed to widening the gender gap in salary. In regard to employment, the NRUF had a negative impact on the share of women among full professors. The findings suggest that organizational pursuit of prestige may have unintended consequences for faculty gender equity.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This comparative case study explores how 18 state education agencies (SEAs) support school districts in advancing standards-based elementary science reform. We identify how SEAs understand their work in advancing elementary science reform and describe how SEAs sought to engage districts in bridging from standards to classroom practice. Based on our analysis, we argue that the school subject is a critical explanatory variable in understanding SEA efforts to support standards implementation and SEAs lean on a resource-based approach for instructional policy implementation. This study contributes to the growing research base on the role of state policy in supporting standards implementation.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Given that a national superintendent dataset has never existed, claims about superintendent turnover and gender gaps have traditionally been based on conjecture or data from a single year and small sample of superintendents. Utilizing a new dataset of all K–12 public school district superintendents in the United States across four school years, this study explores how the superintendent gender gap and turnover have changed over time and across states and district types. Analyses reveal that superintendent turnover has increased, particularly among men, and the superintendent gender gap has marginally narrowed. Although men are increasingly turning over, women are seldom filling those positions—a necessity if the superintendent gender gap is to narrow. State and district analyses are presented, as well as discussion of the implications of the findings and the power of a longitudinal superintendent dataset.
