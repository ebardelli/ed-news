          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent decades have seen a tremendous growth in the development of collusion detection methods, many of which rest on the assumption that examinees who engage in collusion will display unusually similar scores/responses. In this article, we expand the definition of answer similarity to include not only the item scores/responses but also the item response times (RTs). Using detailed simulations and an experimental data set, we show that (a) both the new and existing similarity statistics are able to control the Type I error rate in most of the studied conditions and (b) the new statistics are much more powerful, on average, than the existing statistics at detecting several types of simulated collusion.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research in mathematics education can be understood as a system of activities addressing the basic and applied problems related to teaching and learning of mathematics. Such a system includes the activities of foundation, planning, implementation, evaluation of mathematics instruction, and teacher professional development, which are supported by different theories. This diversity of theories raises interest in their comparison, coordination, and possible integration. The paper aims to present a case of application of the Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), in its 3rd and 4th generation versions, to analyze the emergence of the Onto-semiotic Approach to mathematical knowledge and instruction as a theoretical framework that addresses the study of the five partial activities mentioned above. This use of the CHAT can be useful in studies on theory articulation by focusing not only on the subjects, the object, and the instruments but also on the community context, the ecological-normative environment in which these activities take place, and the dilemmas or contradictions between theories.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study argues that the works of philosopher Jürgen Habermas can provide useful directions for mathematics education research on statistical literacy. Recent studies on the critical demands posed by statistical information in media highlight the importance of the communicative component of statistical literacy, which involves students’ ability to react to statistical information. By adapting Habermas’ construct of communicative rationality into a framework for statistical literacy, a novel analytical tool is presented that can provide theoretical insights as well as in-depth empirical insights into students’ communication about statistical information. Central to the framework are the four validity claims of comprehensibility, truth, truthfulness, and rightness which interlocutors need to address to engage in statistical communication. The empirical usefulness of the framework is shown by presenting the results of a study that examined Grade 5 students’ responses to fictional arguments about the decline of Arctic sea ice. The Habermas-based framework not only reveals that complex evaluations of statistical arguments can take place even in Grade 5 but also shows that students’ evaluations vary greatly. Empirical results include a content-specific differentiation of validity claims through inductively identified sub-categories as well as a description of differences in the students’ uses of validity claims.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Sequential, multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs), which assist in the optimization of adaptive interventions, are growing in popularity in education and behavioral sciences. This is unsurprising, as adaptive interventions reflect the sequential, tailored nature of learning in a classroom or school. Nonetheless, as is true elsewhere in education research, observed effect sizes in education-based SMARTs are frequently small. As a consequence, statistical efficiency is of paramount importance in their analysis. The contributions of this manuscript are twofold. First, we provide an overview of adaptive interventions and SMART designs for researchers in education science. Second, we propose four techniques that have the potential to improve statistical efficiency in the analysis of SMARTs. We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in SMART settings both through the analysis of a SMART designed to optimize an adaptive intervention for increasing cognitive behavioral therapy delivery in school settings and through a comprehensive simulation study. Each of the proposed techniques is easily implementable, either with over-the-counter statistical software or through R code provided in Supplemental Material.

          Abstract
                  <p>The recent PISA mathematics results delivered disappointing news for the United States of America (USA). These results underscored the education system’s continuing inequalities. An important question concerns to what extent and to which part of the educational system do these sources of inequality occur? In this paper we use PISA 2012 data merged with district- and school-level variables derived from five additional national databases to explore the way socio-economic status (SES) and race are related to inequalities in student performance as well as to inequalities in other components of schooling at both the system and student-levels, such as the academic ‘zeitgeist’ of the school, the nature of the mathematics curriculum and characteristics of both the teacher and the student. The results demonstrated how race and SES had significant relationships not only to student performance but to other aspects of schooling as well. Those relationships occurred at both the system- and within-school levels but differed in their implications. The policy implications of the research could help determine where the greatest effort could be made to provide all children of all racial and social classes equal opportunities to learn.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Using administrative data of center-based child care providers in North Carolina from 2005 to 2018, we provide the first direct evidence on the effects of competition on provider quality and student outcomes in the context of early care and education, taking advantage of quality measures from the state’s Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). We found that competition was associated with higher quality ratings and a higher probability to achieve a five-star rating—the highest tier in the QRIS. More competition increased providers’ probability to improve their rating and reduced the time to improve. Compared to public schools, private providers were responsive to competition. However, we did not find any effects of competition on district-level student third-grade academic performance.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>We present a model of capital that expands existing models to introduce two new forms of capital (time and body capital) as sources of inequity in education. The aim is to (a) make visible core resources that are relevant to educational outcomes and also (often hidden) sources of inequity, (b) identify commonalities across diverse empirical and theoretical research strands, and (c) reconceptualize existing research from an asset rather than deficit framework. We explain how time and physiological resources can be conceptualized as forms of capital and link this to extant empirical and theoretical research across fields. Then, we describe how students may have different amounts and types of time and body capital, as well as different drains on capital, and how this may lead to educational inequities. We close by describing the affordances of using this theory as a lens for analyzing existing educational structures, policies and practices.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 536-567, March 2023. <br>The concept of “thriving” in educational policy refers to a loosely defined mix of academic, socioemotional, and civic outcomes associated with youth well-being. In this chapter, we analyze three focus areas in K–12 education—social emotional learning, 21st-century skills, and digital citizenship—and conclude that they are currently built on an individualistic neoliberal paradigm of learning and success. We argue that this paradigm is incommensurate with the personal, social, and civic flourishing necessary to sustain equitable multiracial democratic futures and offer instead an alternative collective logic of thriving. Our critical metasynthesis of the emergent field of social-design-based experimentation offers design principles educators can use to reorganize collective learning environments to support expansive youth thriving in schools and society.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 155-160, March 2023. <br>Transforming difficulties into opportunities for thriving is at the heart of this volume on the science of learning and development. This chapter brings the perspective of European research and the Global North and South and discusses some of the challenges included in the call to create the conditions for promoting sustainable and equitable futures for all. Among others, globalizing transformative knowledge by recreating, replicating, and scaling up success stories in education research can overcome methodological or epistemological limitations. Examples of cocreation and interdisciplinary work are included to produce socially relevant knowledge and be effective in tackling the real problems affecting children and youth. Dialogic learning and successful educational actions illustrate how educational success and transformation can happen.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 167-172, March 2023. <br>In analyzing the disseminated call, the commentary suggests the need for a consciousness consistent with a quote from Maya Angelou concerning identity. It is applied—in this case—to the situation of social science and specifically developmental science vis-à-vis published scholarship pertaining to communities of color. Questioned is the field’s long-term positionality regarding the persistent marginalization of Blacks. Suggested is the need to be candid in acknowledging the redundant “embracing of the lie of Black inferiority.” Argued is that the field’s positionality when it comes to representations of communities of color (i.e., embodied in “scholarly efforts”) serves as an untoward, incentivized, and under acknowledged contributor to the science of learning and development, which has problematic consequences for all.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 568-605, March 2023. <br>This chapter focuses on effective preparation for civic reasoning, discourse, and problem solving. It reviews literatures, including major synthetic reviews and studies from the science of learning and development (SoLD), civics education, and mathematics education. Based on these reviews, the authors make the case for a more comprehensive form of civic education in which reasoning, discourse, and problem solving permeate the curriculum across grades and subject matter. As an example, the authors illustrate how mathematical tools and techniques inform powerful fact-based civic reasoning and discourse and how SoLD informs both. This approach to learning engages students in politically relevant issues in a nonpartisan way as they prepare to become democratic decision-makers and problem solvers of the future.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 161-166, March 2023. <br>Transforming the South African education system after decades of apartheid remains a dream for all. This chapter contributes on how this dream can be achieved. To this end, I raise two arguments. First, transformation will require young people to become adept at handling tensions and dilemmas. Second, I propose that the science of learning and development (SoLD) has a possibility to develop such competences. I begin with a look at the colonial education curricula in South Africa until the dawn of a democratic dispensation in 1994. This is followed by a critique of the post-1994 curriculum. In closing, I propose the SoLD model as an alternative to the classroom in South Africa as a route to equity and justice.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 218-273, March 2023. <br>This chapter explores how learning to be in relation is core to human learning. Reductive views of cultural variation and individualized conceptualizations of thriving overlook the processes through which human beings learn to live relationally in ways that support systems transformation and collective well-being. Synthesizing literature on learning and development, we provide a conceptual model that examines four interrelated dimensions of relationality: (a) embodiment, mobilities, attention, and place; (b) affect, awe, and emotion; (c) pedagogical interactions, supports, and participation; and (d) reimagining learning and the disciplines. We argue that attending to relationality in ways that include between-persons + place + more-than-human relations helps conceptualize learning as deeply tied to the ongoing forms of adaptation, ethical relations, and worldmaking required for socio-ecological well-being.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 84-99, March 2023. <br>This chapter focuses on the utopian methodological approach taken up by social design-based experiments, their conceptual underpinnings, and commitments. The methods are drawn from Gutiérrez’s empirical work and detail ways of seeing and capturing human learning activity crucial to envisioning and enacting new social futures with radical possibilities for those from historically nondominant communities. It elaborates methodological commitments to seeking complexity in human learning activity as it centers equity understood as worldmaking. A review of a range of methodological tools employed across Gutierrez’s studies is presented—from an analytical focus on ensembles and the multiplicity of social spaces in learning ecologies to attending to how people’s repertoires of practices are constituted through participation in everyday activity, as they move in and across the ecologies of everyday life.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 185-193, March 2023. <br>This commentary describes several key principles from the science of learning and development (SoLD) and illustrates them using concepts and ideas from social and emotional learning (SEL). Emphasizing the importance of ecological systems in shaping developmental pathways and challenging the individual-centric approach, the first concept focuses on the centrality of developmental relationships. The second underscores the significance of stage-salient tasks in SEL, advocating for practices targeting developmental systems aligned with specific stages. Shifting the focus from product-driven to process-oriented interventions, the third concept highlights the need to prioritize understanding underlying processes for effective interventions. Lastly, the commentary emphasizes simplifying and localizing complex developmental science for practical application, distilling adaptable practices resonant with diverse contexts. Throughout, examples from SEL research and practice illustrate these concepts’ potential to bridge the research-practice gap in human development and education.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 194-201, March 2023. <br>In this chapter, I consider how research in the field of literacy illuminates convergences of understandings about how people learn culled from the fields of biology, psychology, and neuroscience. I further consider how research in the field of literacy could be enhanced by drawing more deeply on state-of-the-art findings about how human learning unfolds. To support this discussion, I examine emerging understandings about literacy learning and development in the areas of reading and multiliteracies and across transnational contexts. I conclude by suggesting an equity-oriented agenda for literacy research and practice that leverages and advances existing knowledge about how people learn.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 100-115, March 2023. <br>Children develop and learn within dynamic contexts, yet the simplifying assumptions of common statistical methods often relegate such complexity to unexplained error. This chapter discusses ideas from the dynamic systems literature, which focuses on the interplay within and between components of complex systems, such as individuals and their multitiered contexts. This chapter presents three scenarios highlighting knowledge from the dynamic systems literature. These scenarios have implications requiring reconsidering common approaches to explaining the variance associated with change, the conceptualization of effect sizes, and the use of between-person data and analyses to make within-person inferences. The final section provides resources for moving beyond dynamic metaphors and principles, so theories can be translated into testable hypotheses.
