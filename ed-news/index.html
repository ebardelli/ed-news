          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher preparation programs are increasingly expected to use data on preservice teacher (PST) skills to drive program improvement and provide targeted supports. Observational ratings are especially vital, but also prone to measurement issues. Scores may be influenced by factors unrelated to PSTs’ instructional skills, including rater standards. Yet we know little about how these measurement challenges play out in the preservice context specifically. Here, we investigate the reliability and sensitivity of two observational measures. We find measures collected during student teaching are especially prone to measurement issues; only 3% to 4% of variation in scores reflects consistent differences between PSTs, while 9% to 17% of variation can be attributed to the mentors with whom they work. When high scores stem not from strong instructional skills, but instead from external circumstances, we cannot use them to make consequential decisions about PSTs’ individual needs or readiness for independent teaching.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Visions of teacher professionalism may shape common conceptualizations of high-quality mentoring, sometimes distortedly. Nevertheless, this relationship is often unnoticed, and studies rarely analyze mentor–teachers’ work according to their interrelating visions. This multiple case study aimed at this literature gap. It examined the goals that accomplished mentor-teachers promoted and their practices and found four mentoring styles that characterized these mentors. After, it interrogated how the mentoring styles interrelated with three distinct visions of teacher professionalism (teachers as intellectuals, craftspeople, or artists). Findings challenge the idea that mentor-teachers’ work can be evaluated as either advancing or degrading teacher professionalism. The study questions this framing of mentoring literature and suggests that a bipolar logic could mislead us to forsake essential aspects of mentoring, for instance, ones associated with apprenticeship relations. The study concludes by offering to replace the bipolar logic with a more balanced consideration of the different aspects of teacher mentoring.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Non-governmental organisations have several mechanisms in place to facilitate learning with and from communities they intend to serve, however these do not always realise authentic participation and meaningful programmatic adjustments. In a participatory research in Central-Eastern Uganda we investigated how the community believes collective learning with NGOs could best be shaped. In this paper we present findings as well as reflections on the learning spaces that emerged in the research and how one could assess whether collective learning is a transformative practice. We offer a conceptual framework NGO practitioners can use to enrich their collective learning toolkit as well as to track and trace small shifts and changes happening in learning trajectories in order to lobby for resources to allow collective learning to happen more authentically, through increased presence and informal interaction with communities.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This article, based on collaborative ethnography, describes five low income white mothers’ equity literacy practices as they advocated for their children's diverse “failing” school during a state takeover. Mothers used both hard and soft advocacy. They promoted equity by reinforcing positive aspects of the school community, and resisting and reframing negative stories perpetuated about the school based on stigma at the intersection of race, class, and standardized educational attainment. They shared the ideal of exposing their children to “real life” by staying loyal to their school. However, their advocacy can also be understood as subtly reifying whiteness. These mothers’ stories present possibilities, and challenges, for realizing interracial solidarity that fosters and sustains equitable schooling in the United States long term.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines whether the National Science Foundation’s ADVANCE-IT grant program identifies and funds institutions that improve faculty gender equity. By using matching procedures and a two-way fixed-effect event study, we find that when universities received ADVANCE-IT grants, their proportion and headcount of women faculty as full-time new-hire, overall faculty, and tenured and tenure-track faculty are not different from multiple comparison groups of universities—including universities that received other types of ADVANCE grants. Drawing on the concept of intersectionality, we further disaggregate women faculty into subracial/ethnic groups. We did not find consistent evidence supporting that ADVANCE-IT universities increase the proportion or headcount of women faculty in subracial/ethnic groups. We discuss implications for federal grantmaking and diversifying higher education faculty.

          Abstract
                  <p>The transition from secondary to tertiary education is an exciting and yet challenging event in the educational biography of students. During this transition, students often meet with unexpected challenges, which may cause them to drop out from their degree program. Many universities offer bridging courses or longer-term interventions to support their incoming students in this period. To examine the effect of a bridging course designed to reduce gaps in prior mathematical knowledge, promote social-emotional well-being, and foster learning skills, we implement a repeated-measures intervention study. We analyze the outcomes of the intervention, which features tutors with special training, autonomous choice of topic areas, peer learning, and materials for self-directed learning. We measure the development of motivational beliefs reflecting the will to learn (achievement goals, satisfaction of basic psychological needs, implicit theories, self-efficacy) and the skills to learn (reactions to errors, self-regulated learning) at the secondary-tertiary transition. These aspects are captured at multiple measurement points among students (N = 679) who participate in the bridging course (intervention group) and those who do not (control group). The intervention boosts motivational beliefs related to social embeddedness and learning skills in the short term. The observed decrease in autonomy, competence, and self-efficacy might be explained by higher standards that students use for their self-assessment in the new peer group. In the long term, all aspects of the will to learn, except for social relatedness, show stable to strongly negative developments in both groups. Among those students who do not participate in the bridging course, mostly strongly negative developments are observed. The results suggest that the peer tutoring strategy is highly effective and the need for longer-term interventions to uphold the positive short-term effects.</p>

      </h3>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Merging of Knowledge is a research approach that creates the conditions for people with lived experience of poverty to participate at an equal level with academics and practitioners, in the co-generation of knowledge about poverty. This paper reflects critically on the application of ‘Merging of Knowledge’ to study poverty in Tanzania, assessing its challenges, achievements, and lessons learned about revealing hidden knowledge about poverty. It also provides a brief literature review to place the Merging of Knowledge alongside other participatory approaches. This paper finds that Merging of Knowledge can effectively interrupt patterned social relationships, and empower individuals and peer groups, thereby stimulating transformation of both academics and people and poverty. It does so by addressing imbalances in social status, empowering all groups of participants at each stage of the research, and building trust, confidence, and freedom from fear in a sustainable manner. The conclusion drawn is that Merging of Knowledge holds great promise for future research on topics where strong hierarchies of knowledge exist, and where the physical inclusion of participants in data collection is not readily translated into intellectual inclusivity during analysis and the dissemination of findings.

      </h3>

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Saturday, 23. September 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Numerous nations implement Student Perception Surveys (SPS) in their schools to assess teaching for student learning improvement. However, research suggests no significant change in teachers’ practices following such student voice-based assessment initiatives, noting their struggle to act upon it. Utilizing the pyramid of student voice as a key framework, we investigate how a Participatory Action Research (PAR)-based professional development (PD) shapes a group of Australian secondary teachers’ interaction with SPS and professional learning. Analyses of the teachers’ interviews, research projects, and reflective notes about their use of SPS illustrate how the PAR-based PD informed their practice, specifically: (i) transforming ‘survey fatigue’ to increased student voice; (ii) contemplating personal, professional, and political entanglements; and (iii) (re)building teacher agency—employing SPS as collective learning tools of professional empowerment rather than accountability measures of teaching. Implications include pathways to strengthen teachers’ agency—honoring their professionalism—in assessment spaces increasingly shaped by student voices.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined the empirical base for early childhood (birth to 8) coaching via a systematic mapping review of the relevant literature, including diverse research designs to represent the full breadth of published studies related to early childhood coaching. The systematic review yielded 374 unique studies published between 1987 and 2019 that were coded for type of study design (e.g., causal; quantitative noncausal; qualitative; single-case design); research populations; and reported content, structure, and processes of early childhood coaching. Descriptive analyses revealed that almost half of the study designs were causal (45.99%); over 75% of the studies were interested in the outcomes or experiences of teachers. The most targeted coaching content domains were social-emotional (44.92% of studies) and language/literacy development (43.58% of studies). Reporting on coaching structure was inconsistent across studies. Observation was the most reported coaching strategy during instruction (73.53% of studies), and provision of evaluative feedback was the most frequently reported coaching strategy outside of instruction (62.83% of studies). The review identified the literature base includes a diversity of study designs, and a great majority of studies occur in preschool settings (70.32%). Findings also suggest that a growing number of coaching studies are focused on child outcomes (60.16%). Results indicate a need for more studies that focus on coaches directly as well as research about coaching in infant/toddler programs and in content domains beyond social-emotional and language/literacy.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 709-729, September 2023. <br>Interest in evaluating dose–response functions of continuous treatments has been increasing recently. To facilitate the estimation of causal effects in this setting, I introduce the ebct command for the estimation of dose–response functions and their derivatives using entropy balancing for continuous treatments. First, balancing weights are estimated by numerically solving a globally convex optimization problem. These weights eradicate Pearson correlations between covariates and the treatment variable. Because simple uncorrelatedness may be insufficient to yield consistent estimates in the next step, higher moments of the treatment variable can be rendered uncorrelated with covariates. Second, the weights are used in local linear kernel regressions to estimate the dose–response function or its derivative. To perform statistical inference, I use a bootstrap procedure. The command also provides the option of producing publication-quality graphs for the estimated relationships.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 730-753, September 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce the command cntraveltime, which can calculate both the travel distance and the travel time between two locations in China with respect to different modes of transportation (driving, public transport, and cycling). Existing commands such as georoute, traveltime, and mqtime have difficulties in parsing Chinese locations. cntraveltime solves this outstanding challenge via a feature that enables it to call route-planning services from the Baidu Maps Open Platform. The results of rigorous testing on the features of the command show that, relative to similar existing commands, cntraveltime has the highest capacity in terms of functionality and precision. This suggests that it can be regarded as a useful complement to other existing commands, especially when calculating travel distance and time for locations within China.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 658-682, September 2023. <br>Logistic and probit models are the most popular regression models for binary outcomes. A simple robust alternative is the robit model, which replaces the underlying normal distribution in the probit model with a Student’s t distribution. The heavier tails of the t distribution (compared with the normal distribution) mean that model outliers are less influential. Robit regression models can be fit as generalized linear models with the link function defined as the inverse cumulative t distribution function with a specified number of degrees of freedom; they have been advocated as being particularly suitable for estimating inverse-probability weights and propensity scoring more generally. Here we describe a new command, robit, that implements robit regression in Stata.

Aside from various convenience functions, mpitb also provides low-level tools for advanced users and programmers.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 774-798, September 2023. <br>We introduce two commands, nstagebin and nstagebinopt, that can be used to facilitate the design of multiarm multistage (MAMS) trials with binary outcomes. MAMS designs are a class of efficient and adaptive randomized clinical trials that have successfully been used in many disease areas, including cancer, tuberculosis, maternal health, COVID-19, and surgery. The nstagebinopt command finds a class of efficient “admissible” designs based on an optimality criterion using a systematic search procedure. The nstagebin command calculates the stagewise sample sizes, trial timelines, and overall operating characteristics of MAMS designs with binary outcomes. Both commands allow the use of Dunnett’s correction to account for multiple testing. We also use the ROSSINI 2 MAMS design, an ongoing MAMS trial in surgical wound infection, to illustrate the capabilities of both commands. The new commands facilitate the design of MAMS trials with binary outcomes where more than one research question can be addressed under one protocol.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 884-896, September 2023. <br>Missing values are common in real datasets, and what to do about them is a large and challenging question. This column focuses on the easiest problems in which a researcher is clear, or at least highly confident, about what missing values should be instead, implying a deterministic replacement. The main tricks are copying values from observation to observation and using the ipolate command. Both may often be extended simply to panel or longitudinal datasets or to other datasets with a group structure, such as data on individuals within families or households. This column includes how to satisfy constraints that interpolation is confined to filling gaps between values known to be equal or to observations moderately close to a known value in time or in some other sequence or position variable.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 683-708, September 2023. <br>Large healthcare databases are increasingly used for research investigating the effects of medications. However, a key challenge is capturing hard-to-measure concepts (often relating to frailty and disease severity) that can be crucial for successful confounder adjustment. The high-dimensional propensity score has been proposed as a data-driven method to improve confounder adjustment within healthcare databases and was developed in the context of administrative claims databases. We present hdps, a suite of commands implementing this approach in Stata that assesses the prevalence of codes, generates high-dimensional propensity-score covariates, performs variable selection, and provides investigators with graphical tools for inspecting the properties of selected covariates.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 813-834, September 2023. <br>One way to estimate mortality in countries with incomplete data is to utilize intercensal methods, which do not require model life tables and provide accurate results even in the presence of age distortions and death underregistration. In this article, I revisit three of these techniques (census based, death distribution, and an iterative procedure) and introduce ilt, a command to calculate singledecrement life tables and the net flow of migrants by age. The required inputs are two age-specific population distributions and the average number of deaths between them. The empirical example draws on data from Vietnam, but the methods are extendable to any context and period.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 3, Page 799-812, September 2023. <br>In this article, I introduce new commands to estimate text regressions for continuous, binary, and categorical variables based on text strings. The command txtreg_train automatically handles text cleaning, tokenization, model training, and cross-validation for lasso, ridge, elastic-net, and regularized logistic regressions. The txtreg_predict command obtains the predictions from the trained text regression model. Furthermore, the txtreg_analyze command facilitates the analysis of the coefficients of the text regression model. Together, these commands provide a convenient toolbox for researchers to train text regressions. They also allow sharing of pretrained text regression models with other researchers.
