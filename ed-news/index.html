          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article provides a process to carefully evaluate the suitability of a content domain for which diagnostic classification models (DCMs) could be applicable and then optimized steps for constructing a test blueprint for applying DCMs and a real-life example illustrating this process. The content domains were carefully evaluated using a set of defined criteria, which are purposely defined to improve the success rate of DCM implementation. Given the domain, the Q-matrix is determined by a simulation-based approach using correct classification rates as criteria. Finally, a physics test on the final Q-matrix was developed, administered, and analyzed by the author and the subject-matter experts (SMEs).

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article introduces a new framework for articulating how educational assessments can be related to teacher uses in the classroom. It articulates three levels of assessment: macro (use of standardized tests), meso (externally developed items), and micro (on-the-fly in the classroom). The first level is the usual context for educational measurement, but one of the contributions of this article is that it mainly focuses on the latter two levels. Co-ordination of the content across these two levels can be achieved using the concept of a construct map, which articulates the substantive target property at levels of detail that are appropriate for both teacher planning and within-classroom use. This article then describes a statistical model designed to span these two levels and discusses how best to relate this to the macrolevel. Results from a curriculum and instruction development project on the topic of measurement in the elementary school are demonstrated, showing how they are empirically related.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Friday, 31. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The nonparametric classification (NPC) method has been proven to be a suitable procedure for cognitive diagnostic assessments at a classroom level. However, its nonparametric nature impedes the obtention of a model likelihood, hindering the exploration of crucial psychometric aspects, such as model fit or reliability. Reporting the reliability and validity of scores is imperative in any applied context. The present study proposes the restricted deterministic input, noisy “and” gate (R-DINA) model, a parametric cognitive diagnosis model based on the NPC method that provides the same attribute profile classifications as the nonparametric method while allowing to derive a model likelihood and, subsequently, to compute fit and reliability indices. The suitability of the new proposal is examined by means of an exhaustive simulation study and a real data illustration. The results show that the R-DINA model properly recovers the posterior probabilities of attribute mastery, thus becoming a suitable alternative for comprehensive small-scale diagnostic assessments.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study explores the prevalence and implementation of four key school counseling policies at the state level and to what extent they are monitored for positive impact on the school counseling profession. Drawing on an analysis of state school counseling policy documents and interviews with school counseling leaders from 30 state education agencies, we found that policies vary considerably across states. Within states, the constrained authority of state counseling officials and lack of funded counseling mandates contributed to differences in policy implementation at the local level. These barriers can unintentionally reduce the efficacy of counseling policies and thus their impact on students.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines implementation of college-and-career-ready (CCR) education standards across five school districts in Ohio, Texas, California, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. Drawing on the policy attributes theory, we found that the specificity of districts’ approaches to two long-recognized policy levers, curriculum and professional learning, was critical in shaping how stakeholders implemented and experienced CCR policies. We identified an approach we called “flexible specificity”—flexibility informed by ongoing data collection and evaluation that allowed districts to develop specific, useful guidance about curriculum and professional learning based on stakeholder needs. We present four shared practices characterizing this approach in two districts, analyzing why those districts seemed to find the right balance of specificity and flexibility while others struggled.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>It is a much-lamented fact that research with the potential to inform or influence education policy instead remains policy inert. There are many reasons for this frustrating state of affairs, including a lack of strategic thinking on the part of researchers on how to successfully accomplish outreach—as opposed to communication with peers (in-reach). Another, and a principal focus of this article, is the failure of researchers to appreciate the power of employing compelling narratives to bring their findings to the attention of policymakers and other stakeholders. Accordingly, this article presents some examples of narratives specifically designed for outreach and discusses some of their features. It also considers the challenges in gaining traction with counternarratives once a particular narrative has achieved currency. Researchers should also be mindful of the tenor of the times, with experts now often viewed with skepticism, if not downright hostility. In some quarters, excessive reliance on technocrats is even seen as a threat to democratic governance. The article concludes with some recommendations on how to appropriately enhance the role of research in education policymaking.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>White supremacy and anti-Black racism are deeply embedded in educational organizations and disrupting them is key to creating more racially just schools. This essay details how the regular practice of organizational routines reproduces racial domination and subordination. We argue that combining critical perspectives on race with organizational improvement approaches can help disrupt this reproductive process. More specifically, educators can engage in critical reflection and action to interrupt, deconstruct, and redesign organizational routines in ways that challenge and hopefully undermine white supremacy and anti-Black racism in schools. We highlight how this approach could help create more racially just educational contexts.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this critical race discourse analysis of legal documents and correspondence, we discuss how a small number of highly organized and visible groups of Asian American parent activists oppose admissions policy reforms intended to diversify student enrollment to specialized high schools. We identify two narratives deployed by this vocal minority: anti-Asian discrimination and Asian American exceptionalism. These narratives prioritize the historical and interpersonal racialized experiences of Asian Americans over institutionalized racial inequality experienced by Black students, namely, residential housing and school segregation. By valorizing Asian American exceptionalism and meritocracy, these claims relegate racism as a historical problem, mirroring ideologies of white supremacy and anti-Blackness while reconstituting anti-racism.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, we argue for the value of theorizing antiblackness to educational justice efforts, particularly those aimed at ensuring Black students succeed and thrive in schools. We first define antiblackness and describe how a frame of antiblackness can help to illuminate ongoing dehumanization and violence done to Black people in schools and society. We explain how antiblackness manifests in education before describing the potential of three strategies for dismantling antiblackness: abolishing, renarrativizing, and revaluing. Ultimately, we argue that antiblackness theorizing does critical work that, in combination with other traditions in antiracist scholarship and activism, can contribute to Black liberation and racial justice through education.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 29. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This study considers the degree to which attendance policies and practices to address chronic absenteeism in a large Midwestern urban school district create suffering in Black parents’ experiences. In a secondary analysis of longitudinal qualitative data conducted through Afro-pessimist conceptualizations of anti-Blackness, we found that the district’s attendance policies antagonize Black parents in ways that create psychological and material distress; and that educators characterize Black parents as problems they must overcome. These findings demonstrate how attendance policies and practices are imbricated in anti-Black social processes, inviting social death into Black family life. In the ongoing struggle to realize Black freedom, the paper calls for abandoning incentivize-and-punish approaches that assume Black parents and students are inadequately committed to schooling.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 29. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The presence of armed police officers in schools has sparked considerable policy debate and demands for reform. Thus far, much of the debate has centered on an empirical analysis of school resource officers rather than school police officers and their impact on particular student populations, especially those burdened by their greater vulnerability to punitive interactions such as detention and arrest. In this article the authors show that an examination of the data reveals that interactions between students and police follow distinct patterns with respect to race and geographic space. The authors use the “sociospatial dialectic” method to explain why certain student populations are most vulnerable to negative interactions with school police within particular spatial settings. Oral history interviews with 120 Black students in a large urban public school district reveal two self-reinforcing pathways: (1) soft coercion, when care and courtesy meet preemptive criminalization to produce punitive policing, and (2) shielding, when referrals to school police officers by school personnel shift blame onto students and invite the use of punitive policing without care. These findings underscore the racialized and contextually specific nature of school policing’s social and spatial processes for Black students in low-income communities.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State educational agency content coordinators commonly experience tensions in their professional roles related to distinct sets of beliefs, or logics, about who “should” control what students learn: the state bureaucracy, the local community, or the broader profession. Using an institutional logics frame and drawing on interviews with coordinators for English/language arts representing about a third of U.S. states, we illustrate how individuals navigate these competing traditions of decision-making. Multiple logics shaped coordinators’ perceptions of their job responsibilities and goals, as well as the actions they felt were possible for them to take in creating and providing resources, communicating those resources to local stakeholders, and providing professional development. More consistent messaging to coordinators about the types of outreach the state views as acceptable would better support high-quality literacy instruction.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study aims to analyze possible connections among the noticing skills of pre-service mathematics teachers, and specifically the skills of attending to students’ thinking, interpreting students’ mathematical understanding, and proposing teaching alternatives. We characterized these connections in terms of coherency, i.e., the extent to which pre-service teachers take into account (a) an identified critical event—including its mathematics and context—when interpreting students’ statements, (b) their own interpretation of students’ statements when interpreting the teacher’s response, and (c) their own interpretation of students’ statements when proposing alternative teaching strategies. The construct of coherency evolved during our attempts to analyze pre-service teachers’ interpretations of the critical events they identified while observing mathematics lessons as part of their preparation program. In this paper, we elucidate the construct of coherency and its different levels and demonstrate how this construct relies upon and expands existing ideas from the literature on noticing. We propose a framework for identifying different coherency levels and the different patterns identified when using the framework to noticing among the pre-service teachers. Some of these patterns are supported by previous research, while others were unanticipated. We explore possible explanations for the emergence of these unanticipated patterns.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Truth and its consequences in teacher education form a web of interconnected relationships that align our attentions with our intentions. This article responds to an essay I wrote twenty years ago, and I examine the assumptions, questions, and possibilities in the frame of a more modern context. While many of the ideas remain salient, an examination of the truths I explained and the consequences I examined have shed new light on what truths and consequences for teacher education have unfolded in the last two decades.
