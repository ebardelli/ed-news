          Abstract
                  <p>Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ordinality skills in early numerical development. Here, we investigate individual differences in ordering sets of items and suggest that children might also differ in their tendency to spontaneously recognize and use numerical order in everyday situations. This study investigated the individual differences in 3- to 4-year-old children’s tendency to spontaneously focus on numerical order (SFONO), and their association with early numerical skills. One hundred fifty children were presented with three SFONO tasks designed as play-like activities, where numerical order was one aspect that could be focused on. In addition, the children were administered tasks addressing spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON), numerical ordering, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production. Our results showed that children had substantial individual differences in all measures, including SFONO tendency. Children’s SFONO tendency was associated with their early numerical skills. To further investigate the association between SFONO tendency and numerical ordering skills, a hierarchical regression was conducted for a group of children who could successfully order sets from one to three at a minimum and were regarded as likely having the requisite skills to spontaneously focus on numerical order. The findings reveal that SFONO tendency had a unique contribution to children’s numerical ordering skills, even after controlling for age, cardinality recognition, and number sequence production. The results suggest that SFONO tendency potentially plays a relevant role in children’s numerical development.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Definitions play an integral role in mathematics and mathematics classes. Yet, expectations for definitions and how they are intended to operate, i.e., mathematical norms for definitions, can remain hidden from students and conflict with other discursive norms, explaining differences in mathematicians’ and students’ understandings of the nature of definitions. We examined how six inquiry-oriented Introduction to Proof instructors supported their students in revising their definition drafts to adhere to mathematical norms. We identified four procedures that effectively supported students’ drafts in adhering to various mathematical norms, particularly to those that worked to increase clarity. We discuss how the instructors’ teaching practices provided different opportunities for students to engage with mathematical norms for definitions, general mathematical norms, and mathematical content.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many studies rely on teachers’ reported career intentions instead of measuring actual turnover, but research does not clearly document how these variables relate to one another. We test how measures of teacher intentions relate to turnover. Using nationally representative data on 102,970 public school teachers, we conduct a descriptive and regression analysis to probe how teachers’ turnover intentions are and are not associated with moving schools and leaving teaching. While there is some variation across measures of intent, we find evidence that intention is distinct from, but strongly related to, turnover. We advise that surveys continue to capture intention as it provides meaningful information, but we recommend intention not be used as proxy for turnover.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>We utilize original survey data to examine factors influencing parental assessment of schools. When asked a series of questions about their evaluation of hypothetical schools in a survey experiment, respondents were given the option to select “don’t know” and explain in their own words what additional information they would want to know about the school in order to make their decision. Respondents were especially likely to answer “don’t know” in response to a question about school safety. We explore patterns of “don’t know” responses through analysis of the open-ended answers that respondents provided. Rather than focusing solely on school characteristics, open-ended responses reveal that parents tend to worry about crime and safety issues in the neighborhoods surrounding schools. We discuss the implications of these findings for education policy, school practice, and education research methods.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Previous research provides evidence that developing a growth mindset—believing that one’s capabilities can improve—promotes academic achievement. Although this phenomenon has undergone prior study in a representative sample of ninth graders in the United States, it has not been studied in representative samples of other grade levels or with standardized assessment measures of achievement rather than more subjective grades. Using a rich longitudinal data set of more than 200,000 students in Grades 4 through 7 in California who we followed for a year until they were in Grades 5 through 8, this article describes growth mindset gaps across student groups and confirms, at a large scale, the predictive power of growth mindset for achievement gains. We estimate that a student with growth mindset who is in the same school and grade level and has the same background and achievement characteristics as a student with a fixed mindset learns 0.066 SD more annually in English language arts, approximately 18% of the average annual growth or 33 days of learning if we assume learning growth as uniform across the 180 days of the academic year. For mathematics, the corresponding estimates are 0.039 SD, approximately 17% of average annual growth or 31 days of learning.

          Abstract
                  <p>Across recommendations for teaching undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses, instructors, including graduate student instructors (GSIs), are encouraged to implement techniques that actively engage students in the material. Despite these recommendations, GSIs’ adoption of active learning techniques remains limited. Research suggests that instructors’ knowledge about and emotions towards using active learning can promote or inhibit their use of active learning in the classroom. However, little is known about how GSIs’ knowledge about and emotions towards using active learning evolve over time. We present findings from a longitudinal case study following two GSIs within a department of mathematical sciences across four semesters and discuss observed breakthroughs regarding their knowledge of, emotions towards, and use of active learning techniques. Data from surveys, interviews, and classroom observations revealed that GSIs’ breakthroughs in their use of active learning only occurred after their increased knowledge about active learning aligned with their emotions towards it. This study further revealed that the GSIs needed to feel confident in and be challenged by their course structure, such as teaching in classrooms more suitable for active learning, before implementing such techniques. From these findings, we provide suggestions for professional development programs and discuss future research practice when investigating GSIs’ longitudinal development as instructors who use active learning techniques in the classroom.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The promotion of effective teacher professional development (ETPD) is a critical issue in the field of teacher education. The present study investigated how ETPD is affected simultaneously by teacher- and school-level factors across the United States, China, Finland, and Singapore. The data were drawn from the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS 2018) and analyzed using a hierarchical linear model. Findings showed that scores on social utility motivation to teach, self-efficacy in student engagement, and school participative climate were positively and significantly correlated with scores on ETPD across the four countries. It was concluded that gender, education background, teaching experience, personal utility motivation to teach, teacher self-efficacy in classroom management, and teacher–student relations made significant, yet inconsistent, differences in ETPD in the four countries. Motivating teachers to teach and creating a democratic, participatory, and caring school culture may be important measures to promote effective professional development of teachers globally.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This paper’s purpose is to review theoretical explanations of college transitions, offer a critique of their utility, and make an explicit argument that the field of higher education would benefit from a shift from a view of transition as induction or development to transition as becoming. Moreover, we propose that the use of legitimate peripheral participation paired with transition as becoming as an emerging theoretical viewpoint that (1) points toward ways educators can shape environments that support transitions as becoming, (2) more effectively describes the lived experiences of students in transition, and (3) facilitates improved understanding, study, and implementation of student transition programs in the United States.

        <a href='aera open'>Thursday, 23. May 2024</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The current study investigated the prevalence and outcomes related to Head Start (HS) children’s dual enrollment in state-funded prekindergarten (state Pre-K) using a secondary analysis of a statewide integrated administrative dataset (N = 2,986). It also explored whether a program partnership between HS and the local school district (within the same geographic service area) was associated with HS children’s higher enrollment in Pre-K. Findings showed that over half of the children attending HS additionally participated in Pre-K. Such dual enrollment, which reflects more daily hours of center-based early care and education, predicted higher teacher-reported school readiness skills, including cognitive, language, literacy, math, physical, and social-emotional skills. The rate of HS children’s dual enrollment was higher when their HS grantee had a stronger partnership with the local school district. Our findings highlight the importance of systematic efforts to maximize the utilization of ECE-allocated resources for low-income children.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='aera open'>Thursday, 23. May 2024</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Using social network analysis, we sought to characterize the professional collaboration and advice networks among rural science teachers. Furthermore, we explored how the characteristics of individual teachers and distance between teachers affected the likelihood of forming connections. Science teachers in publicly funded rural schools were asked whom they collaborate with and seek advice from and the mode and frequency of their communications. Results were analyzed using UCINET to calculate statistical significance of tie formation. Ties among rural teachers were sparse, with a quarter of teachers having no connections within the bounded network. In contrast to other social network studies, characteristics of individual teachers were not a significant predictor of tie formation in our population, but geographic proximity was a strong predictor. Our findings suggest that districts can support teachers in forming supportive ties by providing time, funding, and/or technology tools and training.

          Abstract
                  <p>Formative Assessment (FA) is a promising teaching practice for supporting students’ learning at school. However, implementing FA into teaching (mathematics) is challenging, effects of implementation of FA vary between empirical studies. Therefore, recent studies additionally consider instructional quality of teaching when analyzing effects of FA on students’ learning. The current exploratory study builds on this idea and highlights the added value of considering both generic and subject-specific instructional quality (GIQ and SSIQ) when analyzing effects of FA: Based on a re-analyzation of data from the research project Co2CA, 856 students from 39 mathematics classes of German middle schools took part in an intervention control-study aiming at implementing FA into mathematics education at school. On the student level, students’ mathematics achievement is assessed by standardized tests before and after the intervention. During the intervention, on the class level GIQ and SSIQ are assessed by low- and high-inference ratings of 72 video-taped lessons. GIQ is based on the model of Three Basic Dimensions, SSIQ is based on the normative idea that mathematics teaching should offer opportunities for a deep understanding of subject matter and for building up competencies. Multi-level regression analyses highlight different (interaction) effects of GIQ and SIQ on students’ performances. It becomes obvious: Considering GIQ and SIQ can have an added value for the better understanding of implementing FA into teaching (in mathematics education).</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>There has been a renewed interest in creativity as a twenty-first century skill in K-12 mathematics education. However, previous research has paid less attention to creative actions than to other learning outcomes, which are often product- instead of process-based, especially in a programming context. Thus, situated in the context of mathematical learning in a block-based programming environment, Scratch, this study seeks to investigate how in-service mathematics teachers develop mathematical concepts and programming skills to demonstrate their creative actions as a form of professional development. By conducting task-based interviews and thematic analysis, we found that testing and iterative practices of reusing and remixing are two important kinds of creative actions inspired by the programming environment, which give rise to new possibilities for doing mathematics in terms of generating new ways to engage in mathematical processes and to understand mathematics from a computational perspective. Our findings will inform teacher education and professional development programs addressing creativity in technology-enhanced mathematics classrooms, with particular attention to the role of mathematics, programming, and their interplay in inspiring teachers’ (and students’) creative actions and new possibilities for doing mathematics.</p>

These include the small pool of applicants with the necessary linguistic and cultural knowledge required to teach in Māori-medium settings. Māori-medium schooling has the dual goals of providing a learning environment where Māori ways of knowing and being are taken for granted and students have access to international notions of academic success. However, many Māori-medium initial teaching education applicants have learnt mathematics in English and have had varying levels of access to Māori practices that could be taught alongside mathematics. To address these challenges, we utilise the cultural symmetry model to guide the design and delivery of Māori-medium initial teacher education tasks using wayfinding.

          Abstract
                  <p>In mathematics, students’ abilities to make transformations between mathematical representations are fundamental. The recent implementation of digital technologies, such as Dynamic Geometry Environments (DGEs), have changed students’ access to mathematical representations by providing a variety of different representations, available just by pressing a button. Students use of a DGE may change their mathematical communication to become more dynamic and active. However, it is not clear how the use of DGEs and the change in communication style relate to more epistemological aspects of students’ mathematical work. This study, therefore, investigates the interplay between students’ dynamic mathematical communication and their transformations of mathematical representations when using a DGE from a competency perspective. Based on analyses of instances of lower secondary school students’ dynamic mathematical communication, findings indicate that students’ mathematical communication reflect the new ways of engaging with mathematical representations when using a DGE. Hence, the communication becomes dynamic. Theoretically, the complexity of having “continuous” transformations of mathematical representations may reduce the readiness of the mathematical communication competency. The “continuous” transformation may in fact cause students to unintentionally ascribe dynamic properties to mathematical representation.</p>

We extend previous research by studying stances prospective teachers adopt, the extent or depth to which they do so, and the types of prospective teachers making sense of students’ mathematical ideas. Analyzing the responses of 123 prospective teachers to students’ different ideas on an ambiguous mathematical task, our study identifies various stances—descriptive, evaluative, comparative, interpretive, inquiry-based, connective, and projective—and explores the complexity of attributing value, meaning, and significance to student ideas. Our findings offer insights into various types of making sense of students’ ideas and suggest that different kinds of attributions are at play for the purposes of observation, assessment, understanding and projection/prediction.</p>
