          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>This study addressed the limited research on advice networks in educational reform by examining structural, relational, and cognitive factors that shape the formation of advice relationships within a districtwide leadership team in the United States. Using stochastic actor-oriented modeling, we investigated a longitudinal set of leadership data at four points in time in one public school district in California during its reform process. Hierarchical triadic structures consistently played a key role in advice relationships. Close friendships and self-efficacy were significant factors throughout the reform. Leaders preferred advice within their workplace level (homophily), but cross-level ties were critical during the reform’s middle phase. This study underscores the importance of fostering both within-level and cross-level advice-seeking relationships, making advice sources visible, and leveraging experienced leaders to guide colleagues, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and supporting cohesive reform efforts.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Scientific research involving children and adolescents as members of research teams are relevant, both because of the possibility of giving voice and leading role to this social group and because it constitutes an expressway of exercising the participation rights enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Increased research involving children and adolescents as co-researchers appears, seeking designs and implementations that safeguard technical, cultural, and ethical aspects. This article reports a methodology implementation of children as co-researchers in a scientific research project associated with school engagement and its contextual factors in Chile. Therefore, the article goes in-depth into the methodology implementation, the conditions of the implementation, and its results. Finally, conclusions and projections for future research in this line are shared.

          Abstract
                  <p>While existing surveys on professional development (PD) programs for mathematics teachers revealed a substantial growth in PD research studies, there has been a call for more in-depth reports. Inspired by reviews on practice-based pre-service teacher education, this systematic review focuses on PD activities developed and investigated for enhancing teachers’ practices for handling relevant tasks of mathematical teaching, to provide an overview of the state of PD research for practicing teachers. To accomplish this, keywords were used to identify relevant research, complemented by hand-searched papers which are in the core of the topic yet do not use the keywords. Based on the full-text analysis of 32 peer-reviewed studies, this systematic review uncovered the emphasis of the most studies on the task of supporting and enhancing student learning followed by noticing and assessing student thinking, with variation in associated teaching practices. Differences in the level of reporting on PD activities were revealed concerning both the PD design and the research about PD. Tendencies in the types of frameworks for designing PD were also found, with almost half the studies situating teacher learning in practice. Overall, this review not only advances the field by making findings on teacher practices to handle tasks of teaching more comparable, but by gaining insights into the types of corresponding PD activities.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Thursday, 13. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Online calibration is a key technology for calibrating new items in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). As multidimensional polytomous data become popular, online calibration methods applicable to multidimensional CAT with polytomously scored items (P-MCAT) have been proposed. However, the existing methods are mainly based on marginal MLE with an expectation-maximization algorithm (MMLE/EM), making it difficult to accurately estimate parameters in high-dimensional scenarios without sufficient calibration sample size or suitable initial values. To conquer these challenges, a neural network (NN)-based online calibration framework was put forward. The new NN-based methods differ profoundly from the traditional ones in that the parameter estimates of new items are obtained by learning the patterns between input and output data instead of finding solutions to the log-marginal likelihood. Moreover, an alternative solution was proposed for traditional methods to obtain appropriate initial values. Simulation studies were conducted to compare the NN- and MMLE/EM-based methods under various conditions, and further explore the properties of the NN-based methods. Results showed that both the NN-based methods and the alternative solution found their strengths in recovering the item parameters of new items, while the MMLE/EM-based methods struggled to converge when more than three dimensions were involved in the test.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Thursday, 13. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Pathological thinking surrounding disenfranchised and marginalized communities remains a problem in education policy, popular discourse, and research on marginalized communities. Scholars employ a host of frameworks to challenge such pathological thinking, often through the language of deficits. We argue that in an effort to refute pathological thinking about marginalized communities, counter-deficit frameworks potentially rely on a different logic of pathology through an overreliance on person-centered rationales for educational success and educational inequity. Specifically, this essay demonstrates how scholars, if they are not careful, can fall into two different pathology traps: (a) the “high achievers trap” and (b) the “blaming teachers trap.” We offer guidance of how to avoid such traps through careful attention to structural forces of oppression.

          Abstract
                  <p>Problem posing is a promising teaching method for enhancing motivation and performance in mathematics and more specifically in mathematical modelling. Hence, the goals of our study were twofold: (1) to examine the effects of problem posing on modelling performance, self-efficacy, and task values in solving modelling problems, and (2) to analyze whether problem posing affects modelling performance via self-efficacy and task values. In a randomized control trial involving ninth- and tenth-grade students (N = 210), participants were assigned to either a problem-posing and problem-solving group or to one of two problem-solving groups. Students in the problem-posing and problem-solving group received a booklet with descriptions of real-world situations and were prompted to pose and subsequently solve their own problems. Students in the two problem-solving groups received the same real-world situations with given problems and were asked to solve the problems. Before solving the problems, students in all groups reported their self-efficacy and task values. Prompting students to pose their own problems positively enhanced students’ self-efficacy and partially improved their task values in solving modelling problems. Further, problem posing indirectly affected modelling performance via self-efficacy but not task values. However, problem posing had no total effect on modelling performance. The findings for self-efficacy and task values are in line with expectancy-value theories, adding new insights to the field by highlighting the importance of motivational constructs in problem-posing approaches and instructions aimed at fostering mathematical modelling.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 12. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The surveillance and securitization of schools has transformed over the last decade to include predictive analytics and algorithms. In Florida, for example, the Pasco Sheriff’s Office used school record data sets to identify and monitor youth they believed were “destined for a life of crime.” Yet the extent of big data policing as a model of surveillance and control in American public schools has not been addressed in meaningful ways by schools and the courts. This essay argues the burden and risk on student Fourth Amendment and privacy rights place an obligation on the government to actively protect student data and make big data policing efforts transparent. Future research is critical to address the systemic inequities that policing and surveillance have exacerbated on America’s youth.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 12. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This brief uses national data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 to investigate deficit beliefs, or beliefs that students’ academic underperformance is primarily attributable to deficiencies in their home environments, among high school math teachers. Descriptive results reveal that students in low-level math courses have teachers with more deficit beliefs. Regression results show that net of extensive control variables for both student and teacher characteristics, having a math teacher with stronger deficit beliefs is significantly and negatively associated with students’ math performance. However, this negative association is not more pronounced for youth from minoritized and low socioeconomic status backgrounds.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Processes of integrating explicit anti-racist goals in research-practice partnerships is under-examined in scholarship, yet intentional anti-racist research-practice partnership (RPP) design and implementation can leverage liberatory and collaborative action research approaches that address the root of racial inequities and advance corrective measures to justly service youth and their families. In this paper, authors analyze qualitative data from the first year of their RPP to describe how they approached their design and launching process as a form of prefiguring for racial justice. They pinpoint how their efforts yielded opportunities, challenges, tensions, and benefits. Their process aligned with Akom’s (2011) Black Emancipatory Action Research (BEAR) framework, which is conceptualized with Afrocentric lenses, honors Black communities, and constructs research as a tool for Black liberation and self-determination. Authors detail findings related to inviting authentic community engagement with justice-driven partners, nurturing youth-centered critical care, disrupting Whiteness norms, and revisiting and negotiating RPP expectations.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this survey, we introduce and prompt an article collection—&quot;Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures&quot;—which we are guest editing. The collection will comprise original research articles, written and published over a 2-year period. Recognising the collection title as making reference to what is an emerging area of research, in this introduction, we survey work that has been done. In the spirit of opening and inviting new questions and research directions, we focus on what it means to take mathematics education for sustainable futures seriously, for how we practise and imagine mathematics education, including established topics such as curriculum, knowledge, pedagogy, teacher education, language, modelling, and technology. We structure our review around eight invitations (here arranged into six sections) in the call for collection articles. Each section ends with further invitations for potential authors, or others, wanting to locate and chart their own work in the space. We end drawing out two themes that resonate across the invitations: attention to who and what is marginalised and the importance of a deep reflexivity in our choice/use of concepts. This text is part of the article collection entitled “Mathematics Education for Sustainable Futures” (available at link.springer.com/collections/acebaagbha).</p>
