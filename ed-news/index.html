          Abstract
                  <p>The paper presents an analysis of elementary grade mathematics teaching in India focusing on mathematical reasoning. Mathematical reasoning is an important tool to make sense of mathematical ideas, which in turn makes mathematics more accessible to learners and promotes social equality. The paper analyzes 112 lessons from Grades 1 to 8 by 21 teachers in 5 schools in a big city in India. Synthesizing the literature, the paper identifies three main functions of mathematical reasoning (reasoning for sense-making, reasoning for inquiry, reasoning for justification) and concomitant reasoning actions. Working from these three functions of reasoning, a scheme that was suitable for categorizing the reasoning observed in the highly teacher-led instruction was developed and applied to identify the nature and prevalence of reasoning across grade levels and topics. No “reasoning for inquiry” was found in the analyzed lessons. Explanatory Reasoning, a limited form of “reasoning for sense-making” with little student input, was observed, usually in extremely short episodes, in about a quarter of lessons. Modelled Reasoning, a limited form of “reasoning for justification” where step-by-step deductive problem solutions were demonstrated, was more common, dominating lessons in some topics, especially in higher grades. In most lessons, the teacher stated rules and procedures without reason; sometimes providing non-mathematical justifications for procedures in lower grades (e.g., the need to follow arrows or use a mnemonic). The observed rarity of Explanatory Reasoning highlights an urgent need for teacher education programs in India to enhance the sense-making mathematical experiences offered to teachers so that they can, in turn, promote sense-making in their students.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>A large body of scholarship focuses on how to prepare White teachers to teach students of Color and guide them to make sense of their Whiteness. Using testimonio, this article adds diversity to teacher preparation literature and makes space for Kelly, a Mexican American preservice generalist teacher, to share her story. In particular, I highlight how her relationships and language ideology influence her ethnic identity construction while participating in the figured worlds of 1) her family, 2) personal K-12 schooling experience, and 3) pre-service student teaching experiences. Kelly’s testimonio is a call to subvert monoglossic language ideologies, value translanguaging, and ultimately prepare PSTs with the self-reflexive capacity to engage in linguistically responsive and sustaining pedagogy.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The asymptotic posterior normality (APN) of the latent vector in an item response theory model is an important argument in modeling and inference. For a single latent trait, Chang and Stout proved its APN for binary items under general conditions, which generalized Chang for polytomous data and Kornely and Kateri for multivariate latent traits (MLT) and binary items. As MLT and polytomous items are nowadays common in psychometry, an APN-theory covering both simultaneously remains an open and ongoing problem. We generalize the APN-theory accordingly, providing thus a broader foundation for developments relying on APN. We also prove consistency of common estimators for the MLT, extending the according results of Chang and Kornely and Kateri.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims to shed light on an overlooked but essential aspect of informal reasoning and its radical implication to mathematics education research: Decentralising mathematics. We start to problematise that previous studies on informal reasoning implicitly overfocus on what students infer. Based on Walton’s distinction between reasoning and argument, and Ernest’s concept of intrapersonal dialogue, we propose two theoretical perspectives for understanding the roles of informal reasoning in argumentation: the semi-formal, and the negotiation perspectives. From the latter perspective, we can say that informal reasoning involves creating alternatives, eschewing the relatively unpromising ones, and choosing the most promising one. To illustrate the advantage of the negotiation perspective over the semi-formal perspective, we present two examples of students’ statistical written reports from a previous study. These examples illustrate that spontaneous concepts influenced the students’ creation of multiple alternatives, and choice of the most promising one, in informal reasoning. Therefore, to better understand the development of mathematical concepts, we need to recognise the role of spontaneous concepts through decentralising mathematics. Finally, we introduce inferentialism as an additional theoretical perspective for investigating both the mathematical development of spontaneous concepts, and the spontaneous development of mathematical concepts. The inferentialist idea of the game of giving and asking for reasons indicates how to empirically investigate the mutual development of spontaneous and mathematical concepts.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study explores how observed emotion-focused teaching in preschool classrooms differs across classroom activity settings. Forty-three teachers were observed across several mornings. A total of 1,604 video cycles were coded for levels of emotion-focused teaching (e.g., total, modeling, responding, and instructing) and their activity settings (e.g., mealtimes and transition). Activity settings seemed to afford—to varying degrees for different teachers—the opportunity to interact with children around their emotional learning. Small-group activity settings had the highest levels of emotion-focused teaching, and mealtimes had the lowest. Emotion instructing occurred most often during whole-group interactions, and emotion modeling occurred most often during children’s independent work. Findings can inform the creation and implementation of professional development to promote these emotion-focused teaching practices. While research is increasingly demonstrating the value of emotion-focused teaching, understanding the variability of such practice over the various activity settings may identify opportunities to enhance the intentional support of children’s emotional learning.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>To ensure that new teachers enter classrooms poised for success, we need more evidence regarding supports that can expedite skill development during teacher education. In this study, we capitalize on mixed-reality simulations as a setting for evaluating such supports. Using a randomized control trial, we examine the extent to which coaching improves text-focused instruction compared to the more typical practice of self-reflection. Then, employing a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, we qualitatively and quantitatively explore the extent to which candidates’ individual characteristics might influence the effectiveness of those supports. We find that, on average, coaching is the more effective support for skill development, but we also surface potential drivers of heterogeneous effects of both coaching and self-reflection, including self-efficacy, extraversion, and prior skills. We conclude with implications for teacher education programs and researchers.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Because data-informed decision-making (DIDM) can help teachers meet diverse learners’ needs (van Geel et al., 2016), educator preparation programs (EPPs) must ensure that preservice teachers (PSTs) develop the data literacy skills needed for effective data use. However, little is known about the ways in which EPPs work towards building PSTs’ data literacy, despite licensure and accreditation requirements compelling EPPs to do so. In this study, we analyzed survey, document, and interview data from Virginia EPPs to determine what present practices for DIDM preparation are taking place across the state. Results point to a lack of uniformity among EPPs for how preparation is undertaken, and that PSTS seem to have limited coursework on data use. Additionally, there appears to be minimal collaboration between EPPs and clinical partners, such that PSTs infrequently have opportunities to engage in DIDM during field experiences.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Milner advances curriculum punishment as a tool to describe how students may be harmed with policy and practice moves in education. Curriculum punishment pushes students and curriculum apart—where practices do not connect with and align with rich and robust diversity among young people, families, and communities. Although curriculum practices should honor, reflect, speak from the point of view of, deepen knowledge about, nuance myopic and mundane notions of, and enhance student identity, motivation, interests, and needs, curriculum punishment does the opposite by presenting one-dimensional, under-substantiated, and untruthful narratives and themes of individuals, communities, and nation-states. Tenets that explicate practices that Milner describes through curriculum punishment are (a) Avoiding, (b) Scripting, (c) Narrowing, (d) Distorting, and (e) Banning. Although some of these practices are beyond the control of teachers, teachers are encouraged to Study, Collaborate with others about, Reflect on, Advocate against, and Transform (SCRAT) Curriculum Punishment.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>During summer, children’s activities are dependent on their families’ and communities’ resources, raising concerns about inequalities in access to summer enrichment experiences. In this research brief, we use nationally representative data from the 1999 and 2011 ECLS-K cohorts to examine trends in kindergarten children’s summer enrichment activities over time by socioeconomic status and race. Although we find that persistent inequalities characterize many of these experiences, there were some promising trends, including small shifts upward in summer home academic activities. We discuss implications and future research directions.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This article provides robust empirical evidence for the association between science teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and student achievement. Unlike previous studies, we employed two approaches (text-based vs. video-based tests) to assess if, and to what extent, teachers’ PCK assessed by these two approaches are related to student achievement. An analysis utilizing two-level hierarchical linear modeling revealed that PCK assessed by both types of tests reveals a significant and positive association with student achievement. Teachers’ PCK assessed by the video-based test better predicted student achievement than teachers’ PCK assessed by the text-based test. Based on this result, we discuss implications for research on teacher knowledge and policy implications for teacher education.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Whole-school reforms have received widespread attention, but a critical limitation of the current literature is the lack of evidence around whether these extensive and costly interventions improve students’ long-term outcomes after they leave reform schools. Leveraging Tennessee’s statewide turnaround reforms, we use difference-in-differences models to estimate the effect of attending a turnaround middle school on student outcomes in high school, including test scores, attendance, chronic absenteeism, disciplinary actions, drop out, and high school graduation. We find little evidence to support improved long-run student outcomes—mostly null effects that are nearly zero in magnitude. Our results contribute to a broad call for educational researchers to examine whether school reforms meaningfully affect student outcomes beyond short-term improvements in test scores.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The recent COVID-19 pandemic and an emphasis on improving access to international education experiences have spurred researchers and practitioners to consider global experiences without international travel. Domestic study away programs can broaden access to intercultural learning for postsecondary students. This systematic literature review, the first known attempt to review the literature on study away, explores how researchers and professionals have previously discussed these opportunities. We draw from 59 publications to understand how study away is defined; conceptual, theoretical, and methodological approaches to investigating study away; common programmatic features; and learning outcomes. We find that study away is often ill-defined, and many empirical publications do not utilize theoretical or conceptual frameworks in their exploration. Learning outcomes attributed to study away were most commonly either psychosocial or related to attitudes and values. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners and highlight directions for future work.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>We Learn Together is a 20-week, low-cost infant/toddler school-readiness intervention developed to provide instructional content and supportive tools for teachers to be more explicit and intentional in interactions with children to support early development. Short-term effects were established in a previously published real-world effectiveness randomized controlled trial. In the present quasi-experimental study, we examined the extent to which the effects remained approximately 1 year after the intervention. Because the original control group eventually also got the intervention, we compared mandatory municipal language assessment outcomes of 2,327 children in the treatment group to matched nontreatment children. The intervention effect was maintained at similar magnitudes at the 1-year follow-up for oral language skills (effect sizes = 0.09–0.14), and spillover effects were found for rhyming skills (effect size = 0.12).
