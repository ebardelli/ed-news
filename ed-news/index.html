          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The effectiveness of incorporating independent reading practice in schools has long been a subject of uncertainty. To shed light on this ongoing debate, this meta-analysis seeks to investigate the impact of in-school independent reading on three crucial measures—attitudes toward reading, word recognition, and comprehension—focusing on K–10 students. The analysis encompasses (quasi-)experimental studies conducted between 1970 and 2020, examining a total of 7,493 students across 47 studies. Because most studies contain more than one outcome measure or effect size, we used a meta-analytic model with a three-level structure. The findings reveal a statistically significant overall effect size (Hedges’ g = .08). Specifically, the effect sizes are more pronounced when considering word recognition (i.e., word attack, word identification, decoding, and fluency; Hedges’ g = .21) and students’ reading attitude (Hedges’ g = .18) as outcome measures. However, the effect size for comprehension—the most commonly assessed outcome measure—was approximately zero (Hedges’ g = −.014).

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Friday, 04. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>As one of the three broad types of test cheating, item preknowledge has always been a severe threat to test validity and is widespread in various testing programs, especially within some high-volume certification testing programs. While many response-based methods have been proposed to identify and handle item preknowledge, most require the assumption that the compromised items are known. Moreover, few studies have considered that both examinee and item characteristics might affect this cheating behavior, and even fewer have considered the relationship between ability and such behavior when estimating ability. Therefore, this article proposes a mixture model with less strict assumptions on the compromised items. By modeling cheating behavior with a latent response approach, the model takes into account the effect of both characteristics at the item-by-examinee level and assesses how a person’s ability relates to such behavior. Two simulation studies demonstrate that the parameters of the proposed model can be effectively recovered, and when data contains item preknowledge, the model generally produces more accurate ability estimates than existing models. Finally, an empirical example based on a licensure test dataset illustrates the applicability of the new model.

          Abstract
                  <p>The study reported in this paper contributes to the literature on prospective teachers’ decision making, specifically regarding how they analyze and make informed decisions about the use of their textbooks. We designed a training intervention with 28 future Costa Rican teachers, in which they had to identify and manage semiotic conflicts that can be found in a textbook lesson. For this purpose, we selected a lesson on proportionality from a textbook commonly used in Costa Rica. We performed an interpretive and exploratory content analysis of teachers’ responses to the textbook lesson assessment tasks. The results show that participants progressed in identifying semiotic conflicts and could produce effective solutions for some of the detected semiotic conflicts. The prospective teachers reflected on the way they used the lesson by proposing improvements in more than one facet (epistemic, cognitive, affective, interactional, mediational, and ecological). We conclude that the training provided allowed the participants to progress in decision making regarding the use of the textbook lesson, although it is necessary to reinforce their didactic-mathematical knowledge on proportionality so that they can develop more critical and well-founded analyses.</p>

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 8-13, October 2024. <br>Transforming schools through mastery learning may solve education's existential crisis, offering today’s learners the relevance and individualization they need while returning to the most ancient form of assessment, proving that learning has occurred. Mastery learning requires significant change to all the norms and practices of school, altering time, space, culture, technologies, and pedagogies. Ira David Socol and Pam Moran share how, in Virginia, Kentucky, and Nevada, statewide innovation networks provide schools with the support, coaching, and peer encouragement required for sustainable change. Backed by both public and private organizations, these networks meet in-person and virtually, work synchronously and asynchronously, and communicate with stakeholders to build fundamental change.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 14-18, October 2024. <br>A mastery-based learning model has limited value in secondary English classrooms, particularly as it relates to writing instruction. Kelsey Hammond and Chelsey Barber argue against the focus on standardized benchmarks that are tied to mastery-based models in favor of an approach to writing that is explorative, personal, and imaginative. The rise of artificial intelligence writing tools like ChatGPT further challenge the traditional mastery paradigm by replicating formulaic writing tasks. The authors advocate for a shift toward fostering self-actualization, empathy, and creative expression in students, emphasizing writing as a means of personal growth and social discourse rather than a mere demonstration of skill.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 28-33, October 2024. <br>Demetrius Fuller developed the HOMies, eight characters who represent eight habits of mind for learners, while he was an art teacher at a Massachusetts elementary school. When students began talking about the HOMies outside their art class, the initiative spread across the school. Linda Nathan, Demetrius Fuller, and Nate Meyers describe the HOMies and unpack the key ingredients involved in scaling a good classroom practice throughout an entire school. They look at the role of involving teachers from different subject areas and with different perspectives in the program. This example shows how teachers and leaders can ensure that innovative ideas can be shared and sustained so that schools can continually evolve to find ways to meet student needs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 34-38, October 2024. <br>Dialogue, listening, and compromise are essential elements of living in a democracy. In a highly partisan time, is it possible to reestablish common ground when it comes to how best to educate our children in and for democracy? Authors Brendan Sheran, Ashley Carey, Jack Schneider, Rebecca Woodland, and Kathryn McDermott, who are affiliated with Center for Education Policy (CEP) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, outline a process called deliberative polling. They used this process of bringing citizens together in a structured way to deliver information and allow for questions and discussion in their Civic Summit. The event, in which Massachusetts citizens discussed the pros and cons of an upcoming state ballot measure on high school graduation exams, was an example of how a summit can bring people together to discuss, safety ask questions, and debate education issues.

Youth apprenticeships are a way for students to work and gain skills in a chosen career field and earn money while still in high school. Youth apprenticeships are on a continuum of work-based learning that includes job shadowing and internships. Apprenticeships require a yearlong commitment from the students and employers, and students often graduate from high school with career credentials and college credits. Schools and employers must work together to make the experience a success for all participants.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 39-41, October 2024. <br>Shifts in the education system to more student-centered learning will require state and local education agencies to rethink how they do their work. Current accountability systems focus on compliance with standards, as demonstrated in annual summative assessments. Mark Elgart explains that a new approach to accountability will offer more authentic and flexible assessment options and give schools support for continuous improvement in response to assessment results. Instead of focusing on compliance and testing, state education agencies can shift to offering options for assessment and resources for professional development. Local education agencies would be responsible for providing accountability data to the state and providing professional development on how to use assessment data for continuous improvement.
