          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 52-53, November 2024. <br>The closure of school buildings during the pandemic made virtual instruction necessary. Since schools have reopened, its use has become more normalized than it was pre-COVID. Bob Kim discusses some of the civil rights issues education leaders and policy makers must consider if they choose to assign certain students to virtual instruction. Some students, particularly students from low-income families, students with disabilities, and English learners, may have difficulty accessing virtual instruction or receiving the full benefit of instruction when it is delivered virtually.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 48-49, November 2024. <br>Teacher Shanshan Wang took the opportunity to transform an empty area near her school into a vegetable and fruit garden with her students, which they dubbed the Happy Farm. Students planted the seeds and tended the plants. They kept journals about the growing plants and worked together to solve problems when they arose. The produce from the garden is served in the school cafeteria. Wang writes that the students value being out in nature and learning through activities rather than just in their classrooms.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 54-55, November 2024. <br>Research has shown that having a diverse teacher workforce benefits students, but the population of teachers remains predominantly white, even as the student population becomes increasingly diverse. Andrew Kwok and Brendan Bartanen analyzed data from college applications in Texas and found that interest in teacher certification has declined in the past decade more than interest in other professions. Promisingly, the racial makeup of college applicants interested in teaching is relatively diverse. However, at every stage in the process toward becoming a teacher, the diversity decreases. They recommend that education leaders and schools of education make intentional efforts to reach out to students of color early about the possibility of becoming a teacher.

Jonathan E. Collins writes that civics education is currently perceived as a luxury. It is, instead, a societal necessity that will help build and maintain our civic infrastructure.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 42-46, November 2024. <br>Although research has shown that having a school librarian benefits students, librarian positions are being cut in schools across the U.S. SLIDE — The School Librarian Investigation: Decline or Evolution? — examined federal data on school library staffing and interviewed 49 district leaders about their decisions to eliminate or add librarian positions. Keith Curry Lance, Debra E. Kachel, and Caitlin Gerrity report that of 54 total decisions leaders made related to changes in librarian staffing, 28 resulted in librarian increases and 26 resulted in librarian decreases. Decisions to add or eliminate positions were generally related to changes in district priorities. Although leaders expressed that they value librarians’ role in providing information literacy instruction and support and had positive experiences with librarians, some had to allocate resources to other positions. Others had trouble finding librarians with the necessary qualifications. When making staffing decisions, leaders need to consider what benefits librarians offer and how to meet student and staff needs for information and media literacy.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 8-12, November 2024. <br>As chronic absenteeism fails to ease from post-pandemic high levels, schools can turn to many reforms to promote school attendance. Commonly recommended strategies involve increasingly targeted and intensive tiers of interventions. Researcher Thomas S. Dee writes that the research base of many of these interventions is not strong. Schools facing financial and capacity restraints may have difficulty putting interventions in place. Dee suggests that educators obtain information on attendance barriers in their schools and base solutions on those data. Sharing information about attendance with families is one promising intervention.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 32-38, November 2024. <br>The landscape of writing is evolving in the era of generative AI. James Paul Gee introduces the concept of “cybersapien writing literacy,” which emphasizes a synergistic partnership between humans and AI. He outlines four essential types of writing and discusses their potential benefits for personal growth, critical thinking, and societal engagement. Integrative writing combines these writing types to foster what Gee calls “expansive cognition.” This vision of writing already exists in out-of-school learning environments like affinity spaces, but schools face challenges when implementing similar practices. Shifting away from time-based assessments toward individualized, achievement-based learning models will give students opportunities to leverage AI as a tutor, co-teacher, and partner in integrative writing work.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 39-41, November 2024. <br>A civic society depends on people’s ability to reason together, which requires them to seek and tell the truth. However, Sarah Stitzlein argues that schools spend too little time deliberately teaching students the value of honesty. Far from being simply a personal virtue, honesty enables citizens to think and act together for the benefit of all. The rise in populism has led some people to define truth as what feels true to their own experience and the beliefs of their in-group, often dismissing the knowledge of experts. Schools can help students learn to discern truth by engaging in inquiry in which they consider their own beliefs and those of others, as well as information from experts.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 23-27, November 2024. <br>Because housing instability can make it difficult for students to attend school, students experiencing homelessness (SEH) may become chronically absent. For this reason, SEH have lower graduation rates than their housed counterpants. Germany’s second-chance schools give students an opportunity to catch up on their learning so they can take final exams and earn diplomas. Kerri Tobin and Matthias Fischer studied 12 second-chance schools and found that they hold to four basic principles to counter the consequences of irregular attendance: low barriers, flexibility, a needs orientation, and positive motivation. While some of these principles may be difficult to implement in traditional U.S. and German schools, educators can adopt a more positive and compassionate attitude to encourage students to continue attending school, even when it’s difficult.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 28-31, November 2024. <br>Chronic absenteeism is a symptom of a lack of student engagement. Many students feel that schools are not welcoming places and that what they learn in the classroom is not applicable in the real world. Schools like Metropolitan Regional Career and Technical Center (the Met) in Rhode Island offer an alternative to educating high school students that taps into their need for connection to adults and the world outside the classroom. The Met is the first school founded by Big Picture Learning, which has grown into a network of public schools across the country and internationally. Its interest-based learning approach gives students opportunities to explore internships and projects based on their interests and passions. The students devote two days a week to internships during the school year.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 3, Page 13-18, November 2024. <br>Families are critical partners in addressing chronic absenteeism. Drawing from research, authors Thomas J. Capretta, Jingyang (Max) Zhang, and Barbara J. Boone present four throughlines and six strategies for schools to improve attendance by building trust and partnering with families. In view of chronic absenteeism’s association with negative academic and life outcomes and disproportionate impact on underserved student populations, addressing absenteeism with families as partners is essential in building shared expectations and identifying unique solutions to unique barriers. The authors outline practical, accessible, and research-informed guidance for schools to tackle the persistent challenge of student attendance in education through high-quality partnerships with parents and community members.

          Abstract
                  <p>As part of the research on mathematical tasks, the literature on the advantages of using open tasks has been steadily growing. However, limited research exists on the types of open mathematical tasks considered by elementary preservice teachers and their abilities to create those tasks. This study explores the preconceptions of open mathematical tasks held by 56 preservice elementary teachers, as reflected in a survey where they described the characteristics and design of such tasks. The study also examines their reflections on implementing open mathematical tasks in one-on-one interviews with elementary students. Our analysis found that elementary preservice teachers described characteristics of open mathematical tasks that match aspects identified in the literature. They also showed the ability to create an open task to a certain degree. However, the open tasks they designed were predominantly procedural and focused on a few aspects of task openness. This finding indicates that the preservice teachers prefer a narrower spectrum of openness when creating open tasks compared to their preconceptions. Preservice teachers also reported challenges they faced when implementing the open tasks with elementary students. These findings suggest the need for mathematics teacher education to provide opportunities where future teachers design a broad spectrum of open mathematical tasks, while addressing on-the-ground challenges in classroom settings.</p>

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 48, Issue 1, Page 1-27, March 2024. <br>There have been countless efforts to improve academic achievement in public schools across the United States, especially in urban school districts. Few efforts, however, use rigorous analytic modeling tools to anticipate and prevent the potential side effects of change. This chapter proposes the application of system dynamics on educational reform efforts by offering a conceptual model, literature review, and research agenda to identify and mitigate the potential side effects of reform. The model is based on interviews and workshops with public school leaders, teachers, and parents in a midsized midwestern urban city. We identify a “capability trap” that may lead to policy resistance with educational reforms. Limitations to this approach are noted, and future areas of research are identified.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 48, Issue 1, Page 191-219, March 2024. <br>Quantitative education research is often perceived to be “objective” or “neutral.” However, quantitative research has been and continues to be used to perpetuate inequities; these inequities arise as both intended effects and unintended side effects of traditional quantitative research. In this review of the literature, we synthesize how quantitative researchers have attempted to use critical paradigms to address questions of equity in education research published over the past 15 years. We identify and describe three main tensions that critical and quantitative researchers navigated: (a) creating and analyzing social group categories, (b) trying to describe commonalities within group experiences without erasing heterogeneity of experience within the group, and (c) determining what is a “significant” result when conducting critical and quantitative research.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 48, Issue 1, Page 28-57, March 2024. <br>A challenge with universal school-based mental health supports is the limited understanding of potential unintended or unanticipated outcomes. In this review, we examined 47 academic and gray literature sources to address the question, “What are the side effects of universal school-based mental health supports?” We discuss how universal supports can positively impact student mental health, enhance school staff’s knowledge and attitudes in addressing mental health topics, and contribute to an improved school climate. However, universal supports can also lead to school staff feeling the strain of resource and time pressures from integrating mental health programming into demanding schedules, voicing frustrations about or exhibiting resistance to mental health supports, and encountering varied, unpredictable outcomes for different student populations across system contexts.

          Review of Research in Education, Volume 48, Issue 1, Page 248-286, March 2024. <br>Performance-based accountability (PBA) has gained popularity worldwide due to its promise to strengthen the effectiveness and equity of educational systems. Nonetheless, its implementation does not always generate the expected reactions within schools. Through a configurative review, we systematically reviewed 133 empirical studies focusing on PBA side effects. We provide novel insights into the literature on PBA side effects, generating a better understanding of how and under what circumstances they are more likely to occur and through which mechanisms. In contrast to existing reviews, our research includes country contexts where accountability designs are predominantly low-stakes and challenges dichotomous ways of thinking about PBA systems. It uncovers side effects across diverse accountability frameworks and investigates differences and similarities in the mechanisms driving them.
