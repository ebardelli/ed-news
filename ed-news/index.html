      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='aera open'>Tuesday, 03. October 2023</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Although children’s literature has been challenged and banned for decades, some U.S. states have recently enacted legislation limiting how teachers can address such topics as race, sex, and gender in classrooms, which may influence teachers’ selection of literature. To understand this phenomenon, this exploratory concurrent mixed-methods study involved a written children’s literature course artifact and survey responses analyzed through critical literacy and self-censorship frameworks. Findings indicate that preservice teachers reported avoiding conversations about gender and gender identity more often than those about sexual orientation or race. Further, despite legislative changes, participants mostly reported self-censoring due to lack of pedagogical knowledge, lack of policy knowledge, and fear of institutional sanctions, which are long-standing reasons for self-censorship rather than new ones. Comparatively, they self-reported little desire to promote the dominant political ideology. This research indicates that topic-restrictive legislation can influence classroom practice even when teachers do not share the ideology behind such legislation.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Response times (RTs) facilitate the quantification of underlying cognitive processes in problem-solving behavior. To provide more comprehensive diagnostic feedback on strategy selection and attribute profiles with multistrategy cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) and utilize additional information for item RTs, this study develops a multistrategy cognitive diagnosis modeling framework combined with RTs. The proposed model integrates individual response accuracy and RT into a unified framework to define strategy selection and make it closer to the individual’s strategy selection process. Simulation studies demonstrated that the proposed model had reasonable parameter recovery and attribute classification accuracy and outperformed the existing multistrategy CDMs and single-strategy CDMs in terms of performance. Empirical results further illustrated the practical application and the advantages of the proposed model.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 19-25, October 2023. <br>All elementary, secondary, and special education teachers in Massachusetts seeking initial licensure are required to earn a sheltered English immersion (SEI) endorsement. This endorsement is intended to prepare educators to support designated English learners (ELs) in the content areas. However, the course does not reflect current theories of language development or Massachusetts policies about models of second language education. Jennifer Altavilla-Giordano and Emily Blitz explain how they reimagined the course to accomplish three goals: 1) establish a critical stance to SEI instruction, 2) increase the self-efficacy of pre-service teachers, and 3) inspire advocacy on behalf of designated ELs and families.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 8-12, October 2023. <br>Translanguaging supports emergent bilingual students to draw on languages they bring to the classroom to learn, even as they develop English. This practice also supports schools to develop stronger partnerships with students’ communities. Mina Hernandez Garcia, Mary J. Schleppegrell, Hasna Sobh, and Chauncey Monte-Sano report on a researcher-teacher collaboration that studied translanguaging and how it enabled students to demonstrate their knowledge while engaging in inquiry in social studies. Interviews with the teacher and students and episodes of classroom interaction exemplify how students participated and shared their perspectives. They suggest how schools, teachers, and community members can create a translanguaging school that supports students’ learning and futures as bilingual citizens.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 13-18, October 2023. <br>The English learner (EL) population has grown by 35% in the last 20 years. However, in addition to new students being identified as ELs, the EL subgroup is being inflated by students who are not being reclassified within a reasonable and developmentally appropriate timeframe. These students, often labeled long term ELs (LTELs), are a product of chronic systemic failures that have barred these students from an equitable education. Leslie Villegas provides an overview of the LTEL phenomenon and offers recommendations for creating a more even picture of the problem.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 26-28, October 2023. <br>New Jersey’s Vineland Public Schools formed a partnership with Rowan University’s College of Education, in Glassboro, New Jersey, to create a dual-enrollment program in teacher education specifically designed for students in the bilingual program. This program provides Spanish-speaking students with coursework in their native language that leads to a teaching degree with a specialization in bilingual education. It has twin goals of offering a pathway to a college degree for multilingual learners (MLs) and producing future bilingual education teachers. Authors JoAnne Negrin, Catherine Michener, and Brooke Hoffman write about the pilot program’s first year and its goals for the future.

Students in the program also learn about their heritage and culture to stay connected to their families and community. Author Pauline Phi Nguyên Đồng, a Vietnamese language teacher at the high school, suggests that the WHS Vietnamese Language Program is a model for how heritage language programs can be sustained in schools and communities.

Coaches then must work to gain access to teachers’ classrooms. In a recent study of 28 content-focused coaches, researchers Jen Munson and Evthokia Stephanie Saclarides found that coaches used six types of strategies to gain access, typically coordinating multiple strategies tailored to the context. In this article, they describe these strategies and provide a reflection tool coaches can use to identify strategies they might use to increase their classroom access to support teaching and learning.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 37-41, October 2023. <br>The science of reading has captured the attention of educators, policy makers, and the public. Elfrieda H. Hiebert recounts some of what she’s learned from her recent exploration of the topic. She has found that research evidence tends to fall into three categories: research that provides unequivocal conclusions, research that holds promise for solving enduring problems, and research that calls into question long-standing assumptions. When it comes to reading, research is clear that students should learn consistent and common patterns in how letters relate to sounds. Emerging research suggests that automaticity in recognizing letter-sound patterns in words is a function of the frequency with which students encounter patterns in words, making the amount that students read an essential consideration in reading instruction. Research calls into question common assumptions about the 4th-grade slump and what below-basic performance looks like. Understanding the sources of below-basic performances can support students in becoming proficient readers.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 66-67, October 2023. <br>The clinical experience is one of the most important parts of teacher education, but many teacher candidates have little field experience before becoming teachers or have field experience that it reserved for the end of their program and is disconnected from their coursework. Alice E. Ginsberg, Marybeth Gasman, and Andrés Castro Samayoa share how Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) are developing teacher education models that enable candidates to spend more time in preK-12 classrooms throughout their education and to see how their university-level coursework connects to classroom practice. Because MSIs prioritize connecting to the community, instead of focusing primarily on research and publishing, teacher educators are able to spend more time at school sites, solidifying the connection between teacher education and the preK-12 classroom.

Unlike other philanthropic schools. I Promise is neither a private school nor a charter school. Instead, it is part of the Akron Public Schools system and is governed by the school board. Columnist Jonathan E. Collins writes that I Promise is part of the school system and can’t be separated from it. While flawed, school boards are the best way to create a strong and equitable education system and make democracy better. School boards and the districts they govern allow for school improvement at a structural level. They also allow for the public to have a say in the school system, through elections and opportunities for dialogue around how to improve individual schools as parts of a larger system.

The reading board sought a new way to acknowledge the depth and breadth of individualized diagnoses, instructional needs, and social justice in their school district. In addition, the reading board sought to subvert the overrepresentation of subgroups of students, primarily students of color, in special education. By altering traditional referral processes, students benefited from an asset-based, culturally and linguistically restorative, and equitable approach to literacy identity and growth.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 58-59, October 2023. <br>Lily Rosene began her teaching career in 2020 when COVID-19 derailed her career plans and anearby school was desperate for teachers. She entered her first 9th-grade English classroom without a clear understanding of her students or the curriculum. However, she knew reading was important to any English classroom, so she decided to make silent reading part of her routine. And personal experience showed her that personal choice could promote a love of reading, so she decided to let her students pick their own books. This aligned with some of the ideas a mentor teacher shared with her, but it wasn’t a common practice at her school. However, after two years of building a classroom around independent reading and student choice, she saw positive results in her students’ standardized test scores.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 105, Issue 2, Page 48-52, October 2023. <br>The question of achieving equity remains an enduring concern for K-12 teachers and school leaders. Work toward equity and social justice in K-12 schools requires the authentic participation and engagement of racially marginalized students and families. Van Lac, Érica Fernández, and Katherine Cumings Mansfield offer real-life examples of what it looks like to foster student and parent leadership with/alongside teachers and school leaders. They contend that the goals of social justice cannot fully be achieved without the active participation of those most marginalized in K-12 schools.
