          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Nationally, teachers have experienced major changes in how their performance is evaluated. Teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system likely influences whether they will use the evaluation data to make instructional improvements, yet we know little about teachers’ perceptions of their evaluations. Using survey data from Chicago Public Schools, we explore teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system and their perceptions of its fairness and accuracy. Sixty percent of teachers reported being satisfied with the district’s reformed teacher evaluation. However, satisfaction declined following the implementation of the district’s more rigorous evaluation system, driven by tenured teachers’ differentially negative impressions. Notably, teacher satisfaction was higher in schools with strong climates, particularly where teachers perceived instructional leadership as effective. These findings underscore the importance of school leaders in the implementation of teacher evaluation policies and suggest that some principals need support fostering school climates focused on instructional improvement and building strong relationships with staff.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Collaborative relationships between families and teachers of elementary-aged children are complicated by teachers’ lack of training for family engagement and by hierarchical and racialized power differentials. Home visiting can create a space for teachers to center and honor families’ ways of knowing and being, but those home visits need to be conducted in ways specifically intended to build relationships with families; otherwise, the visits can do damage. In this descriptive exploratory study, we examined how teachers responded to families’ openings during home visits. We articulate a theory that describes actions teachers can employ to build rapport, particularly across difference. This work has implications for research on family engagement and for teacher preparation for home visiting.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study leverages national data and a quasi-experimental design to examine the influence of enrolling in an exclusively online degree program on students’ likelihood of completing their degree. We find that enrolling in an exclusively online degree program had a negative influence on students’ likelihood of completing their bachelor's degree or any degree when compared to their otherwise-similar peers who enrolled in at least some face-to-face courses. The negative relationship between exclusively online enrollment and students’ likelihood of bachelor's degree completion was relatively consistent among White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, low-income, and military students. Findings focused solely on those students enrolled in exclusively online degree programs revealed that the negative influence of exclusively online enrollment was exacerbated when the student attended a for-profit 4-year institution.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows high-poverty schools to offer free meals to all students regardless of household income. Conceptualizing universal meal provision as a strategy to alleviate stigma associated with school meals, we hypothesize that CEP implementation reduces the incidence of suspensions, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds and minoritized students. We link educational records for students enrolled in Oregon public schools between 2010 and 2017 with administrative data describing their families’ household income and social safety net program participation. Difference-in-differences analyses indicate that CEP has protective effects on the probability of suspension for students in participating schools, particularly for students from low-income families, students who received free or reduced-price meals prior to CEP implementation, and Hispanic students.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study draws on quantitative reasoning research to explain how secondary mathematics preservice teachers’ (PSTs) modelling competencies changed as they participated in a teacher education programme that integrated modelling experience. Adopting a mixed methods approach, we documented 110 PSTs’ competencies in Vietnam using an adapted Modelling Competencies Questionnaire. The results show that PSTs improved their real-world-problem-statement, formulating-a-model, solving-mathematics, and interpreting-outcomes competencies. Showing their formulating-a-model and interpreting-outcomes competencies, PSTs enhanced their quantitative reasoning by properly interpreting the quantities and their relationships using different representations. In addition, the analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between PSTs’ modelling competencies and quantitative reasoning. Suggestions for programme design to enhance modelling competencies are included.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>To be able to support students’ competence development in solving physics problems over the course of a lesson series effectively, teachers need a proper appreciation of students’ deficiencies. As teachers commonly assess students’ competence by means of written tests, teachers are challenged to interpret students’ work on these tests and to intervene when some students fail to understand the proper application of solution methods in different contexts. This paper evaluates a formative assessment practice where teachers have been instructed to pinpoint students’ level of understanding of kinematics problems by means of a cognitive diagnostic instrument and to provide personalized hints that match students’ current level of understanding. The study is novel in this sense that the assessment of written tests results of students’ problem solving is not expressed in grades and pass rates, but in terms of cognitive level of understanding. The results show that teachers can determine and monitor shifts of performance of students’ cognitive level of understanding by using this instrument. Second, the results indicate that among students with low initial results, the group that received sufficient feedback via sticky notes made significantly more progress in solving problems than the group that did not receive feed forward on sticky notes. Third, the timing of feedback in the form of sticky notes did not affect on students’ progress in achieving mastery at the end of the instruction period. Our conclusion of this study is: Cognition develops through levels and tiers and support is essential to move to the Zone of Proximal Development. Subsequently, we evaluate group and subgroup implications for didactic interventions and propose suggestions for further investigations.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Principal preparation programs play an important role in developing future school leaders’ skills and practices. Internships, or structured opportunities for future leaders to engage in the work of school leadership in hands-on, authentic ways, are among the most essential components of principal preparation. Using longitudinal data from 12 programs in North Carolina, this study extends research on internships by examining the pathways of interns from prior- to post-internship employment. We find that internships are highly localized around interns’ prior- and post-employment schools but not their preparation program, with wide variability in placements between programs. Interns’ demographics do not play a large role in shaping the geography of internship placements. However, we find that preparation program type is strongly related to the geography of internship placements, suggesting that differences in program structure may shape internship placements. We conclude by highlighting the limitations and discussing implications for future research.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A critically important balance in educational measurement between practical concerns and matters of technique has atrophied in recent decades, and as a result, some important issues in the field have not been adequately addressed. I start with the work of E. F. Lindquist, who exemplified the balance that is now wanting. Lindquist was arguably the most prolific developer of achievement tests in the history of the field and an accomplished statistician, but he nonetheless focused extensively on the practical limitations of testing and their implications for test development, test use, and inference. I describe the withering of this balance and discuss two pressing issues that have not been adequately addressed as a result: the lack of robustness of performance standards and score inflation. I conclude by discussing steps toward reestablishing the needed balance.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Studies about collegiate food insecurity show its prevalence as a national issue that disproportionately affects students from marginalized groups. This study further contextualizes this work, examining the ways that multiply-marginalized students navigate systems of privilege and opportunity at selective, normatively affluent universities to meet food needs and pursue personal goals. Findings from this multi-institutional qualitative study highlight asset-based approaches by which students leverage institutional interest in their marginal identities as navigational strategies. Conclusions point to the value of “student pathways navigation” as a conceptual and analytic approach to understanding how students manage collegiate environments.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher education is at a critical crossroads as colleges and schools of education contend with decreased student enrollment, legislative strategizing to limit what is taught, and general pushback regarding what teachers should learn about teaching and their students. As such, the field of teacher education must examine how to collectively rebuff the current movement by policy makers and elected officials who have formalized their desire to maintain the status quo in education. They continue to lobby against social justice in education, critical race theory, multicultural perspectives in teaching, and culturally responsive and relevant pedagogical approaches to classroom instruction, among others. This paper examines the current moment in educational history and highlights opportunities that may transform teacher education policy to become more justice centered.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many educational policies hinge on the valid measurement of student economic disadvantage at the school level. Measures based on free and reduced-price lunch enrollment are used widely. However, recent research raises questions about their reliability, particularly following the introduction of universal free lunch in certain schools and districts. Using unique data linking the universe of students in Oregon public schools to IRS tax records and other data housed at the U.S. Census Bureau, we provide the first examination of how well different measures capture school economic disadvantage. We find that, in Oregon, direct certification provides the best widely available measure, both over time and across the distribution of school economic disadvantage. By contrast, neighborhood-based measures consistently perform relatively poorly.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We design a commitment device for college students, “Study More Tomorrow,” conduct a randomized controlled trial testing a model of its takeup, and measure its effect on tutoring attendance and grades. The device commits students to attend tutoring if their midterm grade falls below a prespecified threshold. Unlike other commitment devices tested in the education literature, the contract carries a financial cost for noncompliance. Students value the contract, with 10% takeup among those randomly assigned a contract offer. Takeup is not higher among students randomly assigned to a lower contract price, however. The contract does not robustly affect tutoring attendance or student course grades. Our results show that college students are willing to pay for study commitment devices.

          Abstract
                  <p>Over the past several decades, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners have placed an emphasis on inquiry-based science and mathematics instruction in elementary school. While inquiry-based science and mathematics instruction can support student learning and engagement, teacher preparation programmes have experienced challenges in preparing elementary teachers to use and maintain inquiry-based teaching practices. In this study, we describe how one teacher preparation programme in Canada partnered with a local elementary school to design a novel initiative that provided elementary preservice teachers with authentic opportunities to employ inquiry-based instructional practices for science and mathematics. Using a thematic approach, we explored 46 elementary preservice teachers’ beliefs, emotions, and feelings about the initiative and its impact on their future careers as teachers. We found preservice teachers were enthusiastic about the initiative and believed it had a positive impact on their future as teachers. The findings suggest implications for programmatic design in elementary teacher preparation programmes.</p>
