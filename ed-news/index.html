          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>An emerging area of research on the diversification of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is that of queer and trans (QT) students who are interested in STEM education and disciplines. The purpose of our study was to identify differences in high school mathematics educational experiences by sexual orientation and gender identity. We used mathematics identity and Leyva’s STEM as a White cisheteropatriarchal space (WCHPS) as our theoretical frameworks to guide our study. Using data from Waves 1 and 2 of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, our exploratory analyses uncovered significant differences between QT and HC students’ mathematics identity. Regression results showed that ideological and relational dimensions of WCHPS in Grade 9 play a significant role in Grade 11 QT students’ mathematics identity. Given the exploratory approach for our study, we aim for our research to begin critical conversations in mathematics education concerning QT students to promote more enriching and welcoming learning environments.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To objectively compare groups on any latent trait using tests, the absence of differential item functioning (DIF) is crucial. While the importance of DIF has been well-established in research, the question of how to identify DIF-free items is still largely open. The fact that item difficulty is not identified from observations may explain this. Recently, DIF tests utilizing the differences between item difficulties across groups, which are identified, were proposed for the Rasch and 2-parameter logistic models. The current paper aims to extend these approaches to the polytomous case using the partial credit model. Performance of the new approach is assessed using a simulation study, and practical recommendations are made.

          Abstract
                  <p>
                           The interrogation of often unintended practices of marginalisation has gained focus in research on mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education throughout the last decades. In this introductory survey paper, work against marginalisation in these contexts of mathematics education is viewed in terms of work towards equity, diversity and inclusion. Based on this interpretation, we present a framework on awareness and practice of equity, diversity and inclusion in mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education research. We then use this framework and a survey method of mapping review to identify and comment on a selection of studies. As a result, we illustrate three research moves towards equity, diversity and inclusion, in the form of interconnected themes: (1) Widening the understanding of the mathematics and the mathematics education curricula (2) Improving the practice and discussion of mathematics teaching (3) Unpacking ideologies in mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education. We finally examine the themes and the special issue papers together to foreground commonalities regarding awareness of discriminatory discourses and practices of creating and distributing opportunities for all groups, including those historically and currently marginalised. Despite the important increase of equity-driven principles of awareness, we conclude that mathematics education research on teaching and on teacher education needs more examples of practices whose development has been proved to challenge marginalisation.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study was an examination of the fractional reasoning of elementary preservice teachers (PSTs) within the context of a dynamic digital environment known as Dynamic Ruler. Using an inductive content analysis approach, we administered four fraction-as-measure tasks to 142 PSTs and devised a comprehensive coding scheme to assess their fractional reasoning. The results showed that PSTs’ fractional reasoning could be categorized into five levels based on how they identified length units and coordinated the units. Notably, this study revealed that adjusting the size of the Dynamic Ruler through dragging could serve as a dynamic mediator, representing the conceptualization of fractions as a measure by identifying appropriate fractional units to measure a given length. We derived practical implications from our study to inform the design of mathematics pedagogy courses aimed at bolstering PSTs’ fractional reasoning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Language proficiency policies act as critical gatekeepers for multilingual international students (MIS) who intend to pursue an education at English-medium universities. The current study revisits the question of the predictive validity of a standardized English proficiency exam—International English Language Testing System (IELTS)—in comparison with 10 indices of written syntactic complexity. This study addressed the following questions: (a) Do MIS’ overall proficiency and writing subtest scores (IELTS) predict their grade point averages (GPAs) in graduate school? (b) Which syntactic complexity indices in online written production (subordination, coordination, length of production, and degree of phrasal sophistication) predict MIS’ GPAs in graduate school? and (c) Which syntactic complexity indices remain predictive of their GPAs when participants’ English proficiency scores (overall and/or writing IELTS scores) are added into the model? Participants’ IELTS scores, GPAs, and asynchronous discussion postings (224) were analyzed through three linear regressions models. Results confirmed that while IELTS composite and writing subscores do predict academic success of graduate MIS, writing scores are better predictors. After accounting for the contributions of overall and writing subscores, mean length of sentence and T-unit remained significant predictors of academic outcomes, explaining a considerable amount of variance in GPAs, beyond that of IELTS. Equity implications for the admissions of MIS are considered.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>In this study, we leverage national data sources to examine the relationship between community colleges’ level of reliance on local funding and their total institutional revenue, focusing specifically on community colleges educating the largest shares of low-income and racially minoritized students. We show that local funding is positively related to total institutional revenue for the pooled sample including all public community colleges, suggesting that local appropriations can supplement state appropriations in ways that benefit a historically underfunded sector of higher education. However, we also show that community colleges’ level of reliance on local funding is negatively related to their total institutional revenue for rural community colleges and community colleges serving an above-average share of low-income students. Our findings align with scholarship in K–12 finance, indicating that local appropriations, such as property taxes, may exacerbate inequities facing the institutions serving larger shares of economically disadvantaged students.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Scholars have long sought to understand the mechanisms that promote and impede successful integration for immigrant children. Contemporary scholarship on immigration and education has made important inroads for understanding the role of immigration policy and place of residence in the incorporation experience of immigrant students. This AERA Open special topic collection adds to the growing body of knowledge in these burgeoning areas by examining how these contexts shape the experience of immigrant students and by focusing on the interplay between policy and place in the lives of immigrant students. The authors in this special topic collection make up a diverse range array of disciplinary perspectives in education and employ a range of methodological approaches.

          Abstract
                  <p>Productive struggle is crucial to students’ mathematics learning. However, it has proven difficult for teachers to sustain struggle when it is productive or make it so when it is not. Studies show that teachers may offer students support when their struggles are productive or even refrain from offering support when students’ struggles are unproductive. This suggests that it is challenging to notice struggle, or more specifically, to attend to and interpret evidence of struggle in determining whether and how to respond. Little research, however, has examined teachers’ noticing of struggle, leaving teacher educators with limited guidance as they strive to prepare teachers to notice and respond to struggle in ways that will ensure students have sustained opportunities to struggle productively. We examined ten middle-school teachers’ noticing of struggle, conceived broadly, while observing students solve challenging problems collaboratively. Teachers attended most to students’ struggles to make sense of the mathematics, less often attending to their struggles to communicate their thinking or overcome challenging group dynamics. Teachers were also guided by three narratives about teaching and learning when interpreting the struggles they attended to, which specified that struggle is productive if students are working well together, making progress, or focused on understanding the mathematics. Teachers typically assessed students’ struggles as productive, especially when attending to students’ struggles to communicate their thinking, yet rarely differentiated their assessments for individual students in a group. We discuss implications for teacher educators striving to prepare teachers to notice and respond to struggle in the classroom.</p>

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Given the importance of conversation practice in language learning, chatbots, especially ChatGPT, have attracted considerable attention for their ability to converse with learners using natural language. This review contributes to the literature by examining the currently unclear overall effect of using chatbots on language learning performance and comprehensively identifying important study characteristics that affect the overall effectiveness. We meta-analyzed 70 effect sizes from 28 studies, using robust variance estimation. The effects were assessed based on 18 study characteristics about learners, chatbots, learning objectives, context, communication/interaction, and methodological and pedagogical designs. Results indicated that using chatbots produced a positive overall effect on language learning performance (g = 0.484), compared to nonchatbot conditions. Moreover, four characteristics (i.e., educational level, language level, interface design, and interaction capability) affected the overall effectiveness. In an in-depth discussion on how the 18 characteristics are related to the effectiveness, future implications for practice and research are presented.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rer'>Friday, 14. June 2024</a> | 
        
          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Universal formal education is a major global development goal. Yet hunter-gatherer communities have extremely low participation rates in formal schooling, even in comparison with other marginalized groups. Here, we review the existing literature to identify common challenges faced by hunter-gatherer children in formal education systems in the Global South. We find that hunter-gatherer children are often granted extensive personal autonomy, which is at odds with the hierarchical culture of school. Hunter-gatherer children face economic, infrastructural, social, cultural, and structural barriers that negatively affect their school participation. While schools have been identified as a risk to the transmission of hunter-gatherer values, languages, and traditional knowledge, they are also viewed by hunter-gatherer communities as a source of economic and cultural empowerment. These observations highlight the need for hunter-gatherer communities to decide for themselves the purpose school serves, and whether children should be compelled to attend.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to unveil pre-service primary school teachers’ (PPSTs) technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) regarding the unit “Let’s Recognize the Force” suggested by grade 3 science curriculum. Through a single-case (holistic) design of case study method, 43 PPSTs voluntarily participated in the study. To collect data, a Google Form with open-ended questions was developed and administered. In analysing the data, the authors improved a four-point rubric to evaluate the quality of their responses. Hence, they scored their responses through the rubric and imported them into SPSS 20.0™ to run correlation analysis for TPACK components. Also, their responses were exposed to content analysis to generate their conceptual schemes via the “cut-off” points. The findings showed that the PPSTs had some shortcomings in associating and transforming their TPACK to the unit “Let’s Recognize the Force.” The current study recommends that future research should focus on how to improve the PPSTs’ domain-specific TPACK.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Prior research documented disproportional representation across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines within the population of students identified as gifted and talented (GT). Less research has focused on what predicts improved representation for English learners (ELs) or students with disabilities (SwDs), or how state GT policies facilitate such representation. This paper attempted to fill that void by analyzing data from the Civil Rights Data Collection and Stanford Education Data Archive along with original coding of state GT policies. We found that while ELs and SwDs are disproportionately underrepresented within the population of students identified as gifted, state mandates for schools to offer GT, requirements for formal gifted education plans, and regular audits for compliance were correlated with higher rates of GT service availability and greater representation among ELs and SwDs. We further describe the characteristics of the top 5% of schools with the highest GT representation for ELs and SwDs.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this study, we use estimated public transit routes for high school students in Baltimore City to predict the number of days they are late during the school year. We find that after adjusting for individual and school characteristics, school preferences, and neighborhood fixed effects, total travel time and transit use are not predictive of tardiness, but requiring a bus transfer is. These estimates do not vary by student or school characteristics, indicating that this is a general phenomenon that has more to do with system-level reliability than individual motivation or school climate. These findings highlight the hidden costs imposed on some students who wish to leave their neighborhood and travel across town for better educational opportunities.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this study, teacher attitudes towards streaming in New South Wales (NSW), Australia were explored. This mixed  methods research surveyed 30 secondary mathematics teachers. Findings indicated that NSW teachers had experience teaching both mixed-attainment and streamed mathematics classes, however streaming was the prevalent practice. Teachers believed streaming was the ideal method of grouping students in mathematics, allowing for better management of workloads and resulting in less behavioural issues. Teachers also believed that streaming positively impacted the academic outcomes of perceived high-ability students. However, there were mixed findings in teachers’ beliefs about the overall impacts of streaming on perceived low-ability students. While, teachers felt that streaming was able to better meet the academic needs of perceived low-ability students, the negative impacts of streaming on the wellbeing of these students was also noted. Overall, we argue that findings indicate that further exploration is needed into ways in which streaming can be made more equitable as it appears to currently be an intractable practice in Australia and other international settings.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Interpersonal and systemic racism and discrimination persist in our educational system—from primary and secondary institutions through college, despite the forward strides of desegregation, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Black Lives Matter movement. This special topic collection identifies and applies empirically and theoretically grounded conceptualizations of racism to improve our understanding of the experience of racism, interventions to mitigate it, and protective factors. The papers in this collection reflect two themes: 1) racial and religious identities in classrooms, schools, and universities, focusing on how educators mitigate and perpetuate systemic racism, including how White teachers understand the impact of race, how inclusive and antiracism curricula are received and rejected by future educators and clinicians, and the impact of exclusionary social networks in the hiring of teachers of color and 2) school belonging and climate, including documenting that students of color feel less safe, are disproportionately exposed to harsh discipline, question their belonging, and question commitments to diversity. The negative sequelae are concurrent and last into adulthood. In addition, there are several advances in theory and measurement, including assessing gendered and racial biases in teachers’ attributions about students’ abilities, frameworks for mitigating colonial and racialized trauma, and domains of antiracist activism to bring racial justice and equity to schools.

          Abstract
                  <p>The importance of mathematics education in preparing students to become successful citizens raises continuous challenges for schools and educational systems, especially in minoritized settings. Research has identified practices and structures in the social and educational context that do not equally support all students’ learning and all teachers’ teaching and learning to teach. The study presented here employs a cultural-historical activity theory perspective to identify micro and macro practices and structures that challenge Muslim teachers’ mathematics teaching and their professional development in Western Thrace, Greece. The data exploited in the study, which is part of a larger project on Muslim students’ learning, were generated through interviews with in-service minority teachers. The results highlight micro and macro socio-political formations that interact to activate minoritization processes. These shape the practice of teaching mathematics as well as individual and collective identities connected to learning and teaching mathematics.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The teacher’s use of representations is a crucial aspect of instructional quality in mathematics education, given their pivotal role in facilitating mathematics learning. However, in our international research community, perspectives on what constitutes high-quality use of representations may vary. This cross-cultural study aims to explore whether the perspectives from Western literature, emphasizing the importance of explicit connections between symbolic and graphic representations, can be extended legitimately to the East Asian context. Using a situated approach, the study elicited norms of high-quality representation use from researchers in Germany and Taiwan. A total of 31 mathematics education professors from both countries evaluated the use of representations in three secondary mathematics classroom situations presented as text vignettes. The vignettes, designed by the German research team, each depicted a situation where from their perspective, a norm of high-quality representation use, specifically the explicit connection between symbolic and graphic representations, was violated. Qualitative analysis of the researchers' responses revealed that in each situation, at least half of the German researchers expected explicit connections between representations. Conversely, the majority of Taiwanese researchers only expected such connections in one situation, particularly when the graphic representation served as an independent learning objective rather than solely aiding conceptual understanding. These findings indicate easily unnoticed culture-specific differences regarding how a common aspect of instructional quality is expected to unfold in teaching.</p>
