          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Research suggests that longer commute times may increase employee turnover probabilities by increasing stress and reducing job attachment and embeddedness. Using administrative data from a midsized urban school district, we test whether teachers with longer commute times are more likely to transfer schools or exit the district. Both descriptively and in regression results employing multiple fixed effects, we find that teachers with longer commutes are more likely to transfer schools within the district. Regression results show that each 5-minute increase in one-way commute time predicts an increase in transfer probability of 0.8 to 1.0 percentage points over most of the commute time distribution. We also find evidence that teachers with the longest commutes (i.e., 40+ minutes each way) have higher district exit probabilities. Moreover, teachers with longer commute times are absent from work more frequently and receive lower observation ratings. We discuss potential implications for local human resources policy and practice.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study investigated the effects of the Leader in Me (LiM), a social-emotional learning program implemented in thousands of schools. A mixed-method design included (1) a collective case study in four diverse, high-implementing elementary schools and (2) a post hoc quasi-experiment using propensity score 1:3 matching of 117 LiM and 348 non-LiM schools to compare achievement and discipline incident rates. The case study indicated that participants perceived LiM as improving social-emotional competencies for both teachers and students. Teachers reported being more prosocial, feeling more camaraderie, using more effective discipline, developing better teacher-student relationships, and enjoying teaching more. Students were more prosocial, confident and motivated, and had fewer problem behaviors. School climate improved. Results replicated across four diverse schools. The quasi-experiment supported results of the collective case study. Schools implementing LiM had higher mathematics and ELA, but not science, scores on state proficiency exams and fewer discipline incidents.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Preschool through third grade (P–3) alignment is regularly named as a key aspect of early childhood education and the transition to formal schooling. However, little is known about P–3 alignment in practice. Using data from 265 observations of math instruction in preschool, kindergarten, first-, and third-grade classrooms in New York City public schools, we explore P–3 instructional alignment as it would be experienced sequentially, over time and across grades, by students. We examine the continuity of developmentally appropriate instructional environments and high-quality pedagogical practices, as well as the progression of P–3 mathematics content coverage. We find notable discontinuities in instructional environments and some pedagogical practices, particularly across preschool and kindergarten. We also find both progression and repetition in math content coverage. Results suggest that, on some dimensions, kindergarten may be poorly aligned with both preschool and the early elementary grades.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article considers the future of teacher education through researching the impact of encouraging cosmopolitan perspectives in an undergraduate children’s literature course for preservice teachers. The research question focuses on how preservice teachers respond to reading and dialoguing through a cosmopolitan lens. Reading literature through a cosmopolitan lens entails a reflexive consideration of personal convictions and a reflective openness to learning from the perspectives of others. The results of this study provide insights into how preservice teachers understood a cosmopolitan response. The results also highlight the need for further critical inquiry into how to invite greater reflexive consciousness and reflective openness to other perspectives in preparing teachers for a diverse society.

      </h3>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Today’s school integration policies in the United States are often “race neutral.” Scholarship on these race-neutral school integration policies finds they do not change the racial and ethnic composition of schools or do so under very specific conditions. Yet, we know relatively little about the mechanisms explaining these outcomes. Building on 2 years of qualitative data collection in two public elementary schools in a New York City implementing a voluntary, race-neutral integration policy, I find school leaders experience a racialized decoupling of their commitment to racial equity from the policy’s race-neutral design, its choice-based design, and the implementation context. I show how school leaders navigated this decoupling and how it led to racialized outcomes. I contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms shaping the outcomes of race-neutral policies, a point of growing importance given recent Supreme Court decisions on higher education.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Full-service community schools are increasingly adopted as educational policy nationwide to transform educational institutions into community hubs, addressing racial and social disparities and countering deficit narratives related to marginalized youth and families. As the movement toward community schooling as an educational policy gains momentum, more research is needed to understand the complex process of conceptualizing such an initiative for racial equity. Spanning from the early planning stages to 3 years into the implementation of community schooling, this paper uncovers the tensions that emerge as school and district leaderships’ interpretation of the purpose of community schooling and root cause of racial inequity unveil conflicting conceptualizations of the community school initiative: community schooling rooted in neoliberal ideals of efficiency, coordination, and service choice, on one hand, and those rooted in more transformative approach with systemic reflection and change in classrooms, schools, and other institutions on the other.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/epa'>Monday, 14. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We use data from Michigan and an interrupted time series strategy to show how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted special education identifications and discontinuations. We find a substantial decrease in K–5 identifications and discontinuations during the 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 school years. Identifications fell by 19% and 12% in the first two pandemic years, with smaller but still significant reductions in discontinuations. Districts with remote schooling and Black, Asian, and economically disadvantaged students saw larger decreases in identifications. By 2021 to 2022 rates returned to trend and continued to grow in 2022 to 2023, albeit at a similar rate to pre-pandemic. This suggests some “catch-up” accounting for delayed or missed identifications but likely not enough at this point to overcome the pandemic induced deficit.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Despite its substantive importance as the strongest predictor of racial achievement gaps, racial economic segregation has been understudied in the previous literature on segregation. This paper describes trends in racial economic segregation over the last three decades and decomposes these trends into different geographic scales (e.g., between-state, between-district, and within-district segregation). Racial economic segregation has decreased since the late 1990s, yet Black students are still considerably isolated in schools with higher poverty rates. Between-district segregation has been the largest component of racial economic segregation, whereas within-district segregation has grown steadily during the last three decades. Findings from this study suggest the imperativeness of interdistrict policy remedies while also highlighting intradistrict policy needs for promoting student diversity across schools in the district.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Trauma studies scholars emphasize naming or acknowledging trauma to promote healing. In response to the recent political and curricular whiplash in the Commonwealth of Virginia, this paper investigates the prevalence and nature of traumagenic events in Virginia’s social studies standards. Data analysis suggests that conceptual insights from trauma studies literature are broadly applicable in the study of traumagenic events in social studies. The findings foreground the role of positionality in the study of traumagenic events and highlight the importance of active verbs and visible actors in acknowledging both trauma and healing in the standards. This paper concludes with a typology for examining collective trauma in social studies curricula and beyond.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/aer'>Saturday, 12. October 2024</a> | 
        
          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers of color often work in schools with few colleagues from the same racial or ethnic background. This racial isolation may affect their work experiences and important job outcomes, including retention. Using longitudinal administrative and survey data, we investigate the degree to which Tennessee teachers who are more racially isolated are more likely to turn over. Accounting for other factors, we find that racially isolated Black teachers are more likely to leave their schools than less isolated teachers. This turnover is driven by transfers to a different district and exiting the profession altogether. Consistent with an explanation that isolated teachers’ work experiences differ, they also report less collaboration with colleagues and receive lower observation scores.

          Abstract
                  <p>Studies show that supporting argumentation in mathematics classrooms is challenging for teachers. This study reports on the experience of seven elementary and middle-school mathematics teachers in an afterschool classroom-based program where they had the opportunity to facilitate research sessions on students’ development of mathematical ideas and different types of reasoning and justification. The study examines the teachers’ support of argumentation as students work collaboratively on challenging mathematical tasks. The results describe pedagogical strategies teachers can use to support students’ development of valid mathematical arguments and types of mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) that influence teachers’ supporting efforts.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study investigated whether a restorative practice initiative improved school climate. The study presents findings from a cluster randomized, controlled trial conducted with 2,248 students from grades 5 to 12 (38% Black, 32% Hispanic) attending 18 schools in the U.S. Northeast. After 1 year of implementation, the experimental analyses of the whole-school initiative did not result in more positive perceptions of school climate for students in the intervention schools compared with students in the control schools. Correlational analyses were also conducted with student surveys in both intervention and control schools. Based on student report, restorative practice exposure in all 18 schools was associated with positive perceptions of the school climate. This suggests that initiatives may need to focus on fidelity of implementation and consistent implementation across more years for substantive school climate gains.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Thursday, 10. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In the modern educational landscape, the integration of gamification into hybrid learning environments has emerged as a promising approach to enhance student outcomes. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive frameworks for designing gamified hybrid courses and validating their impact on student outcomes. This paper proposes a design science-based approach to gamified course design in hybrid learning contexts. Drawing on the principles of design science research, we developed a framework for designing a gamified hybrid course curriculum that incorporates course content, activities, and assessments based on four elements of gamification (achievement elements, utilitarian value, hedonic benefits, and competition). To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a study with 294 students enrolled in a hybrid business course that implemented the proposed gamification framework. Our findings indicate that all gamification elements of our proposed gamified hybrid courses positively enhance student engagement, achievement, and satisfaction. Ultimately, this paper not only contributes to the ‘gamification in education’ literature by providing a comprehensive framework for designing engaging and effective hybrid courses but also proposes a roadmap for the application of design science to embed gamification in business course curriculum design within the context of modern hybrid learning environments.

          Abstract
                  <p>There is a need for middle school students to develop an understanding of square root as a functional relationship. Examining two continuously changing quantities with the square root relationship can promote students to engage in both covariational reasoning and correspondence reasoning. In this study, we conducted a small-scale, exploratory teaching experiment with one middle school student, Ivan. Ivan engaged in a task sequence examining the relation between two continuously changing distances, which had the potential to support the development of smooth covariational reasoning. We found that Ivan was able to examine the continuously changing quantities to reason covariationally, a meaningful accomplishment for a middle school student, and then leveraged his reasoning to develop a correspondence relation. We identify shifts in Ivan’s covariational reasoning as he constructed an understanding of the square root relationship, and discuss how covariational and correspondence reasoning can mutually support one another to engender functional thinking.</p>
