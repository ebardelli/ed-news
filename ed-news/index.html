          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Technology innovation is the key driving force in achieving economic transformation and development. Financial development and the expansion of higher education can promote technological progress primarily by easing financing constraints and improving the level of human capital. This study examines the impact of financial development and higher education expansion on green technology innovation. It conducts an empirical analysis by constructing a linear panel model and a nonlinear threshold model. The present study sample is based on the urban panel data of China from 2003–2019. (1) Financial development can significantly promote the expansion of higher education. (2) The expansion of higher education can improve energy and environment-based technological progress. (3) Financial development can both directly and indirectly promote green technology evolution by expanding higher education. The joint financial development and higher education expansion can significantly empower green technology innovation. (4) In the process of promoting green technology innovation, financial development has a non-linear influence on it, with higher education as the threshold. The effect of financial development on green technology innovation varies according to the degree of higher education. Based on these findings, we put forward policy proposals for green technology innovation to promote economic transformation and development in China.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Sleep, activity, and nutrition (SAN) are key components in overall health, and an individual’s knowledge about and self-confidence to engage in healthy SAN behaviors can have an impact on their actions. Objectives: This evaluation examined SAN knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors among U.S. Army Soldiers prior to participating in a health promotion program. Research Design: Baseline surveys from participating Soldiers provide evidence in this evaluation. Subjects: U.S. Army Soldiers (N = 11,485) participating in a health promotion program completed surveys. Measures: Participants completed an online survey assessing SAN knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors (among other constructs). Results: We examined the common patterns of SAN behaviors, the associations between them, and the differences based on gender and rank. Knowledge, self-confidence, and behaviors were correlated within each of the three SAN domains. Men reported more aerobic exercise (d = .48) and more resistance training (d = .34) per week than women. Officers reported greater self-confidence in their ability to consume a post-exercise snack (i.e., refuel; d = .38), greater refueling behaviors (d = .43), greater activity knowledge (d = .33), and greater self-confidence in their ability to achieve activity goals (d ranging from .33 to .39), compared to enlisted Soldiers. Finally, greater confidence in one’s ability to achieve healthy sleep correlated with getting more sleep, both during workweek (r = .56, p &lt; .001) and weekend (r = .25, p &lt; .001). Conclusions: These baseline data support the need for health promotion of SAN behaviors among these Soldiers.

          Abstract
                  <p>Teacher educators globally have argued that developing coherent programs can combat the fragmentation that often characterizes teacher education and better support teacher learning. Yet, there is little research on coherence in mathematics teacher education, especially from the perspectives of preservice teachers. To that end, in this article, we report how 13 secondary mathematics preservice teachers (PSTs) from one teacher education program perceived their program as coherent, specifically attending to the ideas and practices PSTs engaged with and the settings in which they engaged with those ideas/practices. Based on participatory diagramming interviews and network analysis, we found that PSTs experienced two main sources of incoherence. First, although PSTs had opportunities to learn about equity from multiple settings, they did not perceive that equity and other aspects of mathematics instruction together were coherently organized. Second, PSTs reported learning about two opposing instructional approaches—direct instruction and inquiry-based instruction. PSTs reported that opportunities to learn about inquiry-based instruction were primarily isolated to courses taught by the mathematics education program and were contradicted by learning and experiencing direct instruction in their special education courses, mathematics courses, and field and student teaching experiences. Findings highlight a need to attend to issues of equity, as well as connections among university coursework and between coursework and field. Based on our findings, we conclude with implications for how teacher education programs might respond to and engage with incoherence to support PST learning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>It is estimated that one-third of students completing their doctoral study in the United States are international. This is notable because the higher education socialization processes for international students are uniquely challenging, yet little scholarship has addressed how these challenges influence doctoral students’ pursuits of faculty careers. Employing multi-institutional data from the U.S. research-intensive universities, this study examined how interpersonal socialization difficulties (based in linguistic challenges, cultural differences, and identity-based bias/discrimination) with peers, faculty, and staff were associated with declined interest in pursuing faculty positions at research-oriented universities and teaching-oriented universities. The results indicated that international doctoral students who experienced interpersonal challenges due to cultural conflicts were more likely to lose interest in faculty positions. U.S. higher education is recommended to help both international doctoral students and people around them to minimize communication difficulties of cultural differences to retain international talents who can be future international faculty.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A tree model for diagnostic educational testing is described along with Monte Carlo simulations designed to evaluate measurement accuracy based on the model. The model is implemented in an assessment of inferential reading comprehension, the Multiple-Choice Online Causal Comprehension Assessment (MOCCA), through a sequential, multidimensional, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) strategy. Assessment of the first dimension, reading comprehension (RC), is based on the three-parameter logistic model. For diagnostic and intervention purposes, the second dimension, called process propensity (PP), is used to classify struggling students based on their pattern of incorrect responses. In the simulation studies, CAT item selection rules and stopping rules were varied to evaluate their effect on measurement accuracy along dimension RC and classification accuracy along dimension PP. For dimension RC, methods that improved accuracy tended to increase test length. For dimension PP, however, item selection and stopping rules increased classification accuracy without materially increasing test length. A small live-testing pilot study confirmed some of the findings of the simulation studies. Development of the assessment has been guided by psychometric theory, Monte Carlo simulation results, and a theory of instruction and diagnosis.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 24-52, March 2023. <br>We describe the command artbin, which offers various new facilities for the calculation of sample size for binary outcome variables that are not otherwise available in Stata. While artbin has been available since 2004, it has not been previously described in the Stata Journal. artbin has been recently updated to include new options for different statistical tests, methods and study designs, improved syntax, and better handling of noninferiority trials. In this article, we describe the updated version of artbin and detail the various formulas used within artbin in different settings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 53-85, March 2023. <br>Researchers use finite mixture models to analyze linked survey and administrative data on labor earnings, while also accounting for various types of measurement error in each data source. Different combinations of error-ridden and error-free observations characterize latent classes. Latent class probabilities depend on the probabilities of the different types of error. We introduce a suite of commands to fit finite mixture models to linked survey-administrative data: there is a general model and seven simpler variants. We also provide postestimation commands for assessment of reliability, marginal effects, data simulation, and prediction of hybrid variables that combine information from both data sources about the outcome of interest. Our commands can also be used to study measurement errors in other variables besides labor earnings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 86-96, March 2023. <br>We introduce a new command, robustpf, to estimate parameters of Cobb–Douglas production functions. The command is robust against two potential problems. First, it is robust against optimization errors in firms’ input choice, unobserved idiosyncratic cost shocks, and measurement errors in proxy variables. In particular, the command relaxes the conventional assumption of scalar unobservables. Second, it is also robust against the functional dependence problem of static input choice, which is known today as a cause of identification failure. The main method is proposed by Hu, Huang, and Sasaki (2020, Journal of Econometrics 215: 375–398).

We also propose and implement a new method that 1) allows the user to specify a treatment effect that does not obey the proportional-odds assumption, 2) offers greater accuracy for large treatment effects, and 3) allows for noninferiority trials. We illustrate the command and explore the value of an ordered categorical outcome over a binary outcome in various settings. We show by simulation that the methods perform well and that the new method is more accurate than Whitehead’s method.

      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/stja?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R'>Wednesday, 05. April 2023</a> | 
        
          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 97-118, March 2023. <br>Recently, a new statistical methodology to assess the bias and precision of a new measurement method, which circumvents the deficiencies of the Bland and Altman (1986, Lancet 327: 307–310) limits of agreement method, was developed by Taffé (2018, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 27: 1650–1660). Later, the methodology was extended to assess the agreement. In addition, to allow for inferences, simultaneous confidence bands around the bias, precision, and agreement lines were developed (Taffé, 2020, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 29: 778–796). The goal of this article is to introduce the extended biasplot command, which implements these latest developments, and to illustrate its use by applying it to simulated data included with the command. Note that the Taffé method assumes that there are several measurements by one of the two measurement methods and possibly as few as one measurement by the other for each individual. The repeated measurements need not come from the reference standard but from any of the two measurement methods. This is a great advantage because it may sometimes be more feasible to gather repeated measurements either with the reference standard or the new measurement method.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 265-275, March 2023. <br>Inset plots can be used to “zoom in” on densely populated areas of a graph or to add extra relevant data in the form of, for example, distribution plots. However, the standard Stata command for combining plots, graph combine, does not permit this type of seamless integration. Each plot within a graph combine object is allocated a grid cell that cannot be placed within another grid cell— at least not without certain (invariably unwanted) graphical complications. We present a fairly simple work-around to this issue using reproducible examples. The main idea is to plot insets along a second axis and then artificially modify the range of this axis to constrain the inset plot within a specified area of the main graph. Additional tips are included for producing more intricate, multilayered inset graphs.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 119-147, March 2023. <br>We present acreg, a new command that implements the arbitrary clustering correction of standard errors proposed in Colella et al. (2019, IZA discussion paper 12584). Arbitrary here refers to the way observational units are correlated with each other: we impose no restrictions so that our approach can be used with a wide range of data. The command accommodates both cross-sectional and panel databases and allows the estimation of ordinary least-squares and two-stage least-squares coefficients, correcting standard errors in three environments: in a spatial setting using units’ coordinates or distance between units, in a network setting starting from the adjacency matrix, and in a multiway clustering framework taking multiple clustering variables as input. Distance and time cutoffs can be specified by the user, and linear decays in time and space are also optional.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 243-264, March 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce a command, xtnpsreg, that implements a uniform nonparametric inference procedure for possibly unbalanced panel datasets with general forms of spatiotemporal dependence. We demonstrate how to apply this command via several examples, including 1) the nonparametric estimation of the conditional mean function and its marginal response, 2) the construction of uniform confidence bands for these nonparametric functional parameters, 3) specification tests for parametric model restrictions, and 4) the estimation and uniform inference for functional coefficients in semi-nonparametric models.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 230-242, March 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce the xtgrangert command, which implements the panel Granger noncausality testing approach developed by Juodis, Karavias, and Sarafidis (2021, Empirical Economics 60: 93–112). This test offers superior size and power performance to existing tests, which stem from the use of a pooled estimator that has a faster [math] convergence rate. The test has several other useful properties: it can be used in multivariate systems; it has power against both homogeneous and heterogeneous alternatives; and it allows for cross-section dependence and cross-section heteroskedasticity.
