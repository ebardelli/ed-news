          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), the U.S. Supreme Court overturned decades of precedent regarding the federal right to an abortion for people who can carry pregnancies. This case has substantial significance for the education field, directly affecting school- and college-age marginalized students who can carry pregnancies. In this essay, I argue that Dobbs and subsequent policies have created a significant need for educational research to inform courts, public policy, and practice to improve social and educational structural support for marginalized students who can carry pregnancies in a post-Dobbs era. This need is because Dobbs and subsequent policies have significantly diminished reproductive justice, and reproductive justice is intricately tied to marginalized students’ ability to fully engage in their education. Timely educational research is critical to address the systemic inequities that Dobbs and related policies have exacerbated and reified.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this essay, we explore the tension between research using continuous improvement (CI) paradigms, such as improvement science, and conventional research, and the role and regulation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight. We argue that the current regulatory structure privileges traditional research and hinders collaborative inquiry that centers the voice and agency of those traditionally marginalized. We also question whether IRBs should limit CI efforts required of educational leaders as part of their jobs. We offer recommendations for how IRBs and scholar-practitioners can together support CI efforts.

          Abstract
                  <p>Problem posing engages students in generating new problems based on given situations (including mathematical expressions or diagrams) or changing (i.e., reformulating) existing problems. Problem posing has been at the forefront of discussion over the past few decades. One of the important topics studied is the process of problem posing as experienced by students and teachers. This paper focuses on problem-posing processes and models thereof. We first provide an overview of previous research and then present the results of a scoping review regarding recent research on problem-posing processes. This review covers 75 papers published between 2017 and 2022 in top mathematics education research journals. We found that some of the prior research directly attempted to examine problem-posing processes, whereas others examined task variables related to problem-posing processes. We conclude this paper by proposing a model for problem-posing processes that encompasses four phases: orientation, connection, generation, and reflection. We also provide descriptions of the four phases of the model. The paper ends with suggestions for future research related to problem-posing processes in general and the problem-posing model proposed in particular.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/13394'>Wednesday, 15. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Due to the learning paradox, students cannot have real difficulty in understanding a mathematical concept that they have not yet understood. There is a gap between real difficulties, directly experienced by students, and illusionary ones, only observed by researchers. This paper aims to offer a critical reflection on our understanding of the term difficulty in mathematics education research. We start this paper by arguing that a constructivist perspective, which has often been adopted in researches on mathematical task design, can deal with difficulties in solving a mathematical problem, but it cannot theoretically deal with those in understanding a mathematical concept. Therefore, we need the alternative philosophy of Robert Brandom’s inferentialism to capture students’ real difficulties in conceptual learning. From an inferentialist perspective, we introduce the idea of illusionary and real difficulties. The former is defined as what students cannot do, but they are not conscious of what they should do, while the latter is defined as what students cannot do despite their consciousness of what they should do. Through an eighth grade classroom episode, we argue that it is important in mathematics education research to focus not only on illusionary difficulties but also on the transition from illusionary to real difficulties. Researchers are encouraged to design a learning environment in which students become conscious of what they cannot do and to observe their mathematics learning in such an environment.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In an era where many states’ postsecondary education governance dynamics are evolving, we set out to understand whether state-level governing boards with centralized governance functions affected institutions’ decisions to engage in in-person instruction during the fall of 2020, the first fall of the Covid-19 pandemic. We examined sociopolitical features related to the strength of governance functions of centralized state boards. The data alluded to linkages between Republican control and lower bachelor’s degree attainment linking (β = −.45) with weaker centralized governance. We also found a negative effect from increased centralized governance functions (β = −.12) to in-person instruction at public 4-year institutions for fall 2020. This paper gives a real-time opportunity to see if the characteristics of governing boards influence return to campus.

          Abstract
                  <p>Personas, initially originated in user experience research, are short and simplified representations of particular user groups, and this methodological approach has recently gained ground in educational research. This study aims to explore aspects of personas that may be beneficial for prospective mathematics teachers when they develop digital learning resources. To explore such aspects, we employed qualitative interviews, thinking-out-loud techniques, and jointly developed learning resources with prospective mathematics teachers, and analysed this diverse data with a combination of case study and grounded theory approaches. Consequently, we were able to identify the following essential aspects of using personas in our study: (A) personas as representatives of real people, (B) personas as planning &amp; feedback tools for material development, (C) professionalisation of prospective mathematics teachers (by using personas), (D) differentiation/individualisation for personas through digital learning resources, and (E) motivational elements of digital mathematics learning resources. Based on our results, we concluded that using personas could broaden prospective mathematics teachers’ views on student characteristics and demands that may enable teachers to facilitate the development of differentiated and individualised digital mathematics learning resources.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Saturday, 11. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Scholars and policymakers have consistently argued for the importance of coherence in teacher education (TE). Despite this attention to coherence, challenges of fragmentation and disconnect remain, and little research exists on how study program leaders (SPLs) in TE work to achieve coherence. This article explores how SPLs in two selected TE institutions in Norway perceive coherence and what strategies they use to create coherent TE programs. The two case studies use an ethnographic approach and report on repeated qualitative interviews with seven SPLs, supported by short-term observations over a period of one academic year. The analysis contributes to the small but emergent literature on how SPLs conceptualize coherence and identifies six strategies that SPLs use to navigate persistent barriers within a diverse and autonomous faculty in their ongoing efforts to strengthen coherence in TE programs. Implications for study program leadership in TE are discussed.
