          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 24-52, March 2023. <br>We describe the command artbin, which offers various new facilities for the calculation of sample size for binary outcome variables that are not otherwise available in Stata. While artbin has been available since 2004, it has not been previously described in the Stata Journal. artbin has been recently updated to include new options for different statistical tests, methods and study designs, improved syntax, and better handling of noninferiority trials. In this article, we describe the updated version of artbin and detail the various formulas used within artbin in different settings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 53-85, March 2023. <br>Researchers use finite mixture models to analyze linked survey and administrative data on labor earnings, while also accounting for various types of measurement error in each data source. Different combinations of error-ridden and error-free observations characterize latent classes. Latent class probabilities depend on the probabilities of the different types of error. We introduce a suite of commands to fit finite mixture models to linked survey-administrative data: there is a general model and seven simpler variants. We also provide postestimation commands for assessment of reliability, marginal effects, data simulation, and prediction of hybrid variables that combine information from both data sources about the outcome of interest. Our commands can also be used to study measurement errors in other variables besides labor earnings.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 86-96, March 2023. <br>We introduce a new command, robustpf, to estimate parameters of Cobb–Douglas production functions. The command is robust against two potential problems. First, it is robust against optimization errors in firms’ input choice, unobserved idiosyncratic cost shocks, and measurement errors in proxy variables. In particular, the command relaxes the conventional assumption of scalar unobservables. Second, it is also robust against the functional dependence problem of static input choice, which is known today as a cause of identification failure. The main method is proposed by Hu, Huang, and Sasaki (2020, Journal of Econometrics 215: 375–398).

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 3-23, March 2023. <br>We describe a new command, artcat, that calculates sample size or power for a randomized controlled trial or similar experiment with an ordered categorical outcome, where analysis is by the proportional-odds model. artcat implements the method of Whitehead (1993, Statistics in Medicine 12: 2257–2271). We also propose and implement a new method that 1) allows the user to specify a treatment effect that does not obey the proportional-odds assumption, 2) offers greater accuracy for large treatment effects, and 3) allows for noninferiority trials. We illustrate the command and explore the value of an ordered categorical outcome over a binary outcome in various settings. We show by simulation that the methods perform well and that the new method is more accurate than Whitehead’s method.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/stja?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R'>Wednesday, 05. April 2023</a> | 
        
          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 97-118, March 2023. <br>Recently, a new statistical methodology to assess the bias and precision of a new measurement method, which circumvents the deficiencies of the Bland and Altman (1986, Lancet 327: 307–310) limits of agreement method, was developed by Taffé (2018, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 27: 1650–1660). Later, the methodology was extended to assess the agreement. In addition, to allow for inferences, simultaneous confidence bands around the bias, precision, and agreement lines were developed (Taffé, 2020, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 29: 778–796). The goal of this article is to introduce the extended biasplot command, which implements these latest developments, and to illustrate its use by applying it to simulated data included with the command. Note that the Taffé method assumes that there are several measurements by one of the two measurement methods and possibly as few as one measurement by the other for each individual. The repeated measurements need not come from the reference standard but from any of the two measurement methods. This is a great advantage because it may sometimes be more feasible to gather repeated measurements either with the reference standard or the new measurement method.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/stja?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R'>Wednesday, 05. April 2023</a> | 
        
          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 265-275, March 2023. <br>Inset plots can be used to “zoom in” on densely populated areas of a graph or to add extra relevant data in the form of, for example, distribution plots. However, the standard Stata command for combining plots, graph combine, does not permit this type of seamless integration. Each plot within a graph combine object is allocated a grid cell that cannot be placed within another grid cell— at least not without certain (invariably unwanted) graphical complications. We present a fairly simple work-around to this issue using reproducible examples. The main idea is to plot insets along a second axis and then artificially modify the range of this axis to constrain the inset plot within a specified area of the main graph. Additional tips are included for producing more intricate, multilayered inset graphs.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 119-147, March 2023. <br>We present acreg, a new command that implements the arbitrary clustering correction of standard errors proposed in Colella et al. (2019, IZA discussion paper 12584). Arbitrary here refers to the way observational units are correlated with each other: we impose no restrictions so that our approach can be used with a wide range of data. The command accommodates both cross-sectional and panel databases and allows the estimation of ordinary least-squares and two-stage least-squares coefficients, correcting standard errors in three environments: in a spatial setting using units’ coordinates or distance between units, in a network setting starting from the adjacency matrix, and in a multiway clustering framework taking multiple clustering variables as input. Distance and time cutoffs can be specified by the user, and linear decays in time and space are also optional.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 243-264, March 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce a command, xtnpsreg, that implements a uniform nonparametric inference procedure for possibly unbalanced panel datasets with general forms of spatiotemporal dependence. We demonstrate how to apply this command via several examples, including 1) the nonparametric estimation of the conditional mean function and its marginal response, 2) the construction of uniform confidence bands for these nonparametric functional parameters, 3) specification tests for parametric model restrictions, and 4) the estimation and uniform inference for functional coefficients in semi-nonparametric models.

This test offers superior size and power performance to existing tests, which stem from the use of a pooled estimator that has a faster [math] convergence rate. The test has several other useful properties: it can be used in multivariate systems; it has power against both homogeneous and heterogeneous alternatives; and it allows for cross-section dependence and cross-section heteroskedasticity.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 1, Page 197-229, March 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce the sftt command, which fits two-tier stochastic frontier (2TSF) models with cross-sectional data. Like most frontier models, a 2TSF model consists of a linear frontier model and a composite error term. The error term is assumed to be a mixture of three components: two onesided inefficiency terms—strictly nonnegative and nonpositive, respectively—and a symmetric noise term. When providing appropriate distributional assumptions, sftt can fit models with exponential and half-normal specifications. sftt also fits 2TSF models with the scaling property to mitigate concerns over distributional specifications. In addition, we provide two subcommands, sftt sigs and sftt eff, to assist in postestimation efficiency analysis. We provide an overview of the 2TSF literature, a description of the sftt command and its options, and examples using simulated and actual data.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Breathlessness support services have demonstrated benefits for breathlessness mastery, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes for people living with breathlessness. However, these services have predominantly been implemented in hospital and home care contexts. This study aims to evaluate the adaptation and implementation of a hospice-based outpatient Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service (MBSS) in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided this study. People with chronic breathlessness participated in longitudinal questionnaires (n = 10), medical record audit (n = 14) and a post-discharge interview (n = 8). Caregivers (n = 1) and healthcare professionals involved in referral to (n = 2) and delivery of (n = 3) the MBSS participated in a cross-sectional interview. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated deductively via the pillar integration process, guided by the RE-AIM framework. Integration of mixed methods data enhanced understanding of factors influencing the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the MBSS, and the potential outcomes that were most meaningful for service users. Potential threats to the sustainability of the MBSS related to potential preconceptions of hospice care, the lack of standardized discharge pathways from the service and access to primary care services to sustain pharmacological interventions. This study suggests that an adapted multidisciplinary breathlessness support intervention is feasible and acceptable in a hospice context. However, to ensure optimal reach and maintenance of the intervention, activities are required to ensure that misconceptions about the setting do not influence willingness to accept referral to MBSS services and integration of services is needed to enable consistency in referral and discharge processes.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 151-156, March/April 2023. <br>Despite longstanding criticisms of teacher education, the weight of substantial evidence indicates that teachers who have had more preparation for teaching are more confident and successful with students than those who have had little or none. Recent evidence also indicates that reforms of teacher education creating more tightly integrated programs with extended clinical preparation interwoven with coursework on learning and teaching produce teachers who are both more effective and more likely to enter and stay in teaching. An important contribution of teacher education is its development of teachers’ abilities to examine teaching from the perspective of learners who bring diverse experiences and frames of reference to the classroom.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 131-139, March/April 2023. <br>Situated in the context of Israeli in-service education, this article explores the development of the author’s understanding of the process of learning to mentor from the acquisition of communicative competencies (as identified in an initial study), toward a more discursive view of the process as “participation in competing discourses of practice” (as identified in subsequent studies). Recent work has revealed the intricacies and complexities entailed in translating from one language (teaching) to another (mentoring), often positioning mentors as “lost in translation.” Specifically, studies shed light on issues of morality, expertise, context, and conditions for learning to mentor. To discuss the author’s evolving understandings, she attends to three interrelated themes: Mentoring as connected to teaching, mentoring as distinct from teaching, and conditions for learning to mentor. Finally, the author addresses the question, So what? to consolidate her emergent understandings of the metaphor, framed as assertions for thinking about the practice of mentoring.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Volume 74, Issue 2, Page 160-166, March/April 2023. <br>This paper describes the work of a nine-college consortium that aimed to address the minority teacher shortage. First, the consortium's beginnings, aims, and activities are presented. Then the collaborative process is analyzed in terms of nine factors that have been identified in the literature as contributors to effective collaboration: (a) commitment of institutional officials, (b) mutual needs and interests, (c) clarity about goals, roles, and control, (d) sufficient time, (e) energy, (f) effective communication, (g) resources, (h) leadership, and (i) ongoing evaluation. The analysis resulted in the identification of three additional factors that support successful collaboration: (a) levels of collaboration, (b) continual redefinition, and (c) avoidance of interinstitutional conflicts.
