          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>I examine how youth racialized and gendered as Black girls co-conspired to challenge misogynoir with their peers racialized and gendered as Latina/x and Polynesian girls. I investigate how they did so within an after-school space at a public charter high school that came to be known as the “Critical Feminisms Club.” Thinking about the space alongside the girls in the club, I reveal how they politically and pedagogically engaged love to (a) (re)author the stories of Black girls and (b) challenge the material and ideological misogynoir that circumscribed Black girls’ lives, possibilities, and futurities within their lives and schooling. They (re)narrated how they should be in relation with and responsible to each other as collective, co-relational, and interdependent beings, recognizing how Black womanness/girlness was a genre of being human that was specifically targeted for enclosure, exploitation, and elimination. Their love-politics engaged pedagogy to remake the world such that the safety and protection of Black girls and gender-nonconforming youth was a necessity and priority, which they saw in turn as bound to the safety and protection of the non-Black identified Latina/x and Polynesian girls who accepted this interdependence and mutual responsibility.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This brief reports findings from a survey with middle and high school youth in a midsize district in the Mid-Atlantic. We find that belonging varies by race and ethnicity for young people. Overall, Black and Latino/x youth report lower belonging when compared to their White peers in a pro-diversity and inclusion district. Implications for policy and practice are addressed to improve sense of belonging for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse youth.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Monday, 18. December 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Many novice teachers learn to teach “on the job,” leading to burnout and attrition among teachers and negative outcomes for students in the long term. Preservice teacher education is tasked with optimizing teacher readiness, but there is a lack of causal evidence regarding effective ways to prepare new teachers. In this paper, we use a mixed-reality simulation platform to evaluate the causal effects and robustness of an individualized, brief, and highly directive coaching model for candidates enrolled in a university-based teacher education program as well as for undergraduates considering teaching as a profession. Across five conceptual replication studies, we find that short, targeted, and directive coaching significantly improves candidates’ instructional performance during simulated classroom sessions and that coaching effects are robust across different teaching tasks, study timing, and modes of delivery. However, coaching effects are smaller for a subpopulation of participants not formally enrolled in a teacher preparation program. These participants differed in terms of prior experiences learning about instructional methods, suggesting that coaching in isolation is not as effective without corresponding coursework on targeted practices. Taken together, our five studies provide encouraging evidence that teacher preparation can be an important time for rapid skill development when candidates are given targeted practice opportunities and corresponding support. Although we often think that practice has to happen in real classrooms with real students, we provide robust evidence that “the work of teaching” can be incorporated into teacher education coursework. We highlight implications for research and practice.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many students work during college to offset rising costs, but significant time on the job affects postsecondary outcomes. Analyzing the High School Longitudinal Study (N = 4,418), this article estimates the effects of hours worked on grades, credits earned, persistence, stopping out (i.e., unenrolling for 5 months before reenrolling), and dropping out. The polynomial regression analysis shows that after adjusting for background characteristics, prior academic achievement, institution types, and family obligations, “traditional” undergraduate students begin seeing deleterious effects at 20 hours, which becomes even more severe for those working 28+ hours (and the worst for Pell Grant recipients working long hours). While some work was good for students, on average, financial and family circumstances help explain the curvilinear relationships.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing body of scholarship foregrounds research–practice partnerships (RPPs) as venues for advancing equity in education. However, few studies focus on partnerships with state education agency leaders, despite their influential roles connecting policy and practice. This article explores state leaders’ experiences collaborating in an early-phase, national RPP focused on advancing multilingual learner equity. Findings shed light on how joint work was facilitated through the development of evidence-based resources addressing current problems of practice. Findings also demonstrate the importance of attending to leaders’ dual responsibilities across state and local levels, informing future efforts to foster partnerships with state leaders. Future research is needed to examine the sustainability of state-level RPPs, as well as the experiences of researchers engaging in such partnerships.

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>The concept of statistical sense provides an understanding of the goals of statistics education and helps to clarify the design of activities that promote the development of statistical literacy, reasoning and thinking. The new approaches to statistics in schools mean special attention must be paid to teacher training. This training should enable them to develop their statistical sense while awakening their social awareness. Drawing on the idea of the cycle of learning from data, we developed an activity based on data extracted from EUROSTAT, with the goal being to find out how the social issues underlying the data might play a role in the development of a socially critical stance among prospective teachers. We also wanted to find out how the complexity of the data presented might interfere with a satisfactory resolution of the cycle of learning from data. In general, we observed that when the data were socially relevant and closely related to their interests, the activity generated opportunities for the development of their social awareness. However, the development of the cycle may have been constrained by the difficulties they encountered when handling data with characteristics typical of civic statistics. We conclude that not all the contexts that accompany the cycle of learning from data promote social awareness in the same way and that the data representations associated with the cycle must be aligned with the prospective teachers’ prior statistical knowledge.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The scalability and accessibility of quality professional development (PD) is an ongoing concern in the teacher education community, yet little research has been conducted on potential solutions. We aimed to address this gap by developing an interactive, virtual PD program that uses intelligent tutoring systems and provides instant feedback to teachers. We then explored the role of this program in developing teachers’ content and pedagogical content knowledge of mathematics. We collected data from 60 teachers located across the USA and found that those who completed the program increased their content and pedagogical content knowledge.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>When and how to survey potential respondents is often determined by budgetary and external constraints, but choice of survey modality may have enormous implications for data quality. Different survey modalities may be differentially susceptible to measurement error attributable to interviewer assignment, known as interviewer effects. In this paper, we leverage highly similar surveys, one conducted face-to-face (FTF) and the other via phone, to examine variation in interviewer effects across survey modality and question type. We find that while there are no cross-modality differences for simple questions, interviewer effects are markedly higher for sensitive questions asked over the phone. These findings are likely explained by the enhanced ability of in-person interviewers to foster rapport and engagement with respondents. We conclude with a thought experiment that illustrates the potential implications for power calculations, namely, that using FTF data to inform phone surveys may substantially underestimate the necessary sample size for sensitive questions.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Arizona shifted to using current-year enrollment, instead of prior-year enrollment, as the basis for determining state aid for school districts following the passage of Arizona Education Finance Amendment (AEFA) in 2017. This study examines the short-term effects of AEFA implementation on school inputs—namely, expenditures and district personnel, particularly teachers. We find that the average district does not seem to respond to AEFA. However, our heterogeneity analyses reveal that the highest-income districts significantly reduce more inputs than the lowest-income districts in response to AEFA. The differential impact between these two groups is most evident in instructional expenditures, administration expenditures, total full-time equivalent teachers, and particularly teachers with 1–5 years of experience.

          Abstract
                  <p>Prior research has revealed a variety of factors associated with teacher views around when to incorporate challenging mathematical tasks into instruction, such as teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge and their prior assumptions about student ability. There has been less focus on how motivational beliefs (teacher anxiety, enjoyment, confidence) shape teachers’ views around teaching with challenging tasks. To address this gap, the current study administered questionnaires to Australian primary school teachers (n = 92) prior to them undertaking a professional learning programme focusing on teaching mathematics through sequences of challenging tasks. Employing logistic regression, we found that more teaching experience and lower levels of teacher anxiety teaching mathematics were associated with the view that challenging tasks should be introduced earlier in a student’s schooling. We also found that higher levels of teacher enjoyment substantially increased the likelihood that a teacher would endorse teaching with challenging tasks more than once a week; however, higher levels of teaching confidence somewhat reduced the likelihood. Implications for practice are discussed.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>In response to economic distress, schools are increasingly serving as providers and distributors of social service resources. However, even when schools offer resources that respond to needs, they struggle to attain high levels of uptake. We examine the family-level correlates of participation in school-sponsored resources during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and find that uptake increases with economic need. In addition, net of need, families who report maintaining communication with parents of their children’s classmates take up more resources; and take-up of key meal and digital technology resources is associated with higher levels of take-up of other resources. These findings contribute to efforts to reposition schools as social service hubs by highlighting promising practices to improve resource uptake.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Pundits, politicians, and academics have long worried about potentially low rates of civic participation among STEM-oriented students. Does studying STEM actually decrease the odds that young people will be actively involved in democracy? To answer this question, we created a dataset of over 23 million students in the United States, matched to national validated voting records. This novel dataset is the largest known individual-level dataset in the United States, connecting high school and college students to voting outcomes. It also contains a rich set of demographic and academic variables, to account for many of the common issues related to students’ selection into STEM coursework. We consider two measures of STEM participation: Advanced Placement (AP) exam taking in high school and college major. Using both measures, we find that, across model specifications, the estimated relationships between STEM and voting are small in magnitude—about the same effect size as a single get-out-the-vote mailer. Our analyses demonstrate that, on average, marginally more STEM coursework in high school and college does not contribute noticeably to the low voting rates among young people in the United States.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Previous research has evidenced a strong positive relationship between leisure print reading habits and reading comprehension across the lifespan. The rapid evolution of new forms of leisure digital reading could modify such a relationship. This meta-analysis extends previous research by analyzing the relationship between leisure digital reading habits and reading comprehension. We analyzed 40 effect sizes using multilevel analysis. Data involved 469,564 participants from studies published between 2000 and 2022. The average effect size reflects a small significant effect on reading comprehension (r = .055), which contrasts with the medium size effects found in the literature related to print reading habits and comprehension. This relationship is significantly moderated by the reader’s educational stage. At early stages (primary and middle school) negative relationships are observed between leisure digital reading and text comprehension, while at later stages (high school and university) the relationship turns positive. We highlight the different contributions that reading modalities and technological contexts have on our reading comprehension, especially across the lifespan. In sum, leisure digital reading does not seem to pay off in terms of reading comprehension, at least, as much as traditional print reading does.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study proposes a model of several dimensions through which products of teachers’ context-based mathematics problem posing (PP) can be modified. The dimensions are Correctness, Authenticity, Task Assortment (consisting of Mathematical Diversity, Multiple Data Representations, Question–Answer Format, Precision-Approximation, and Generalization), Task Flow, and Student Involvement. A study was conducted in the context of a professional development (PD) program in which eight secondary school teachers iteratively designed 22 context-based mathematics tasks. Using the variation theory of learning as a theoretical framework and qualitative content analysis methodology, we compared different versions of the same tasks, focusing on items participants added or revised. To demonstrate the usability of the resulting semi-hierarchical model, we apply it to characterize the teachers’ final products of context-based PP. We found that most items teachers composed did not deviate from what we call the “common item form”—items that require numeric, exact, particular-case-related, and close-form answers without involving students in decision-making. Our findings may inform teacher educators and researchers on planning and implementing context-based mathematics task development by teachers in PD.</p>

                  <p>This paper reports on students’ conceptions of minima points. Written assignments and individual interviews uncovered salient, concept images, as well as erroneous mis-out examples that mistakenly regard examples as non-examples and mis-in examples that mistakenly grant non-examples the status of examples. We used Tall and Vinner’s theoretical framework to analyze the students’ errors that were rooted in mathematical and in real-life contexts.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Despite widespread enthusiasm for remedial education programming with refugee populations, there is little rigorous evidence on how to design and implement such programs. We employ a cluster-randomized design of non-equivalent treatment groups to test the impact of access to two types of program enhancement: longer program duration and the addition of skill-targeted social and emotional learning (SEL) activities for Syrian refugees enrolled in Lebanese public schools. We find that, compared to 10 weeks of programming, 26 weeks marginally increases students’ literacy skills (ES = 0.04) and significantly improves behavioral regulation (ES = 0.31), but students reported less positive perceptions of their public school environment (ES= −0.83 to −0.89) and remedial tutoring site (ES= −0.15 to −0.24). We also find that the addition of skill-targeted SEL activities to 26 weeks of programming results in higher student reports of school-related stress compared to programming without skill-targeted activities (ES = 0.21). Implications for program and policy are discussed.
