          Abstract
                  <p>Collaboration between Mathematicians and Mathematics Educators is crucial in advancing knowledge on the teaching and learning of Mathematics, particularly in advanced Mathematics pedagogy. However, there is a need for the type of collaborations where Mathematicians and Mathematics Educators can find common ground, and the synergy of their expertise results in new, hybrid meanings and understandings that can benefit practice. This paper aims to help researchers from these communities come together by presenting a novel methodology for collaborative inquiry and qualitative data analysis—dialogical inquiry—based on Mikhail Bakhtin’s theory of dialogism. In this framework, “truth” is conceived as never finalised but always coevolving through dialogue that involves participants with different “voices” and “languages”. We describe the three principles that underpin dialogical inquiry: motivation, power balance and a process for solving disagreements. These three principles interact together to create a space where critically productive dialogue allows for meanings to coevolve and new, hybrid understandings to emerge. We illustrate our operationalisation of these principles (i.e., the methods of dialogical inquiry) in two areas: understanding solutions to linear ordinary differential equations and making meaning of the Bakhtinian concept of superaddressee. We reflect on our use of this methodology in Mathematics Education research and invite the readers to create their own dialogic spaces of collaboration.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Though schools do not track in Brazil, I find that racial classroom segregation in Brazil is on par with recent estimates from North Carolina high schools (Clotfelter et al., 2020). How does racial classroom segregation occur without tracking, and in a supposed “racial paradise,” no less? Using national, student-level data spanning from 2011 to 2017, I describe racial classroom segregation among Brazilian 5th and 9th graders and assess potential mechanisms identified in the literature. The findings are consistent with segregation by chance in which (1) schools initially segregate students by using effectively random classrooms assignment practices and (2) schools choose to move forward with these initial assignments, even when they are highly segregating, rather than make race-conscious adjustments. This is consistent with the myth of racial democracy, a prominent colorblind ideology in Brazil that promotes the legitimacy of de facto racial segregation and undermines the legitimacy of race-conscious desegregation.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Strong evidence exists for the high vocational calling reported by candidate teachers, but also for the high rates of attrition early in the profession. Current approaches often explain this paradox by the stress associated with first teaching experiences (i.e., vocational stress processes). By contrast, the present study focuses on the stress experienced during teacher education (i.e., academic stress processes), by analyzing the sources of stress and motivation described in writing by French preservice teachers. Using systematic procedures for content analysis (N = 106 autobiographical texts), major results suggest that preservice teachers are mostly motivated by their positive views of the teaching profession, but that the academic demands they face during teacher education challenge their motivation to pursue the career. Implications are drawn on ways to analyze and tackle academic stress processes, in an effort to support candidate teachers’ wellbeing and thus limit attrition rates.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher education programs play a crucial role in developing teachers’ equity/social justice mindsets and technology integration knowledge and expertise. Scholars have advocated for merging these two areas to support common curricular goals and access unique learning benefits. However, little is known about how equity pedagogy and technology integration intersect in preservice teacher (PST) education. This scoping review aims to expand knowledge and understanding at this intersection with the goal of developing a foundation for future research and practice. Findings revealed that relevant studies focused on two main styles of pedagogy: (a) leveraging technology to teach about equity and social justice (i.e., tech-infused equity pedagogy), and (b) adopting a critical stance toward technology’s roles in schools and society (i.e., digital equity pedagogy). We provide a detailed description of these pedagogies and present useful systems of classification for related studies. We also present key implications of this work for PST education practice, policy, and scholarship.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Economic corridors unlock new economic opportunities and tourism development in the region to achieve sustainable development goals. Green economic growth is conducive to environmental sustainability. Economic mega-projects of CPEC promote tourism that leads to communities’ well-being and better quality of life. Modern infrastructure development contributes significantly to economic growth and tourism activities. This study’s objectives emphasize exploring tourism and sustainable development pursuits under OBOR economic projects that open doors to improving residents' quality of life. The growing world is an eyewitness to a continuous rise in emissions and its severe consequences for humankind. It is necessary to show off the leading factors that result in tourism and economic activities causing environmental pollution rather than blame policymakers. Undoubtedly, many studies previously focused on demonstrating the influence of socio-economic factors that lead to better environmental quality. However, the empirical literature on tourism, social well-being, foreign direct investment, and the Environment in Belt and Road developed economies needed improvement. This research applied a series of advanced estimators that help demonstrate the study’s probable results. This study explores the role of Social well-being (HDI), tourism development, FDI, renewable energy, information &amp; communication technology (ICT), and urbanization on CO2 emissions in Belt and Road (BRI) developed economies.Estimated results exhibited the significant contribution of ICT and renewable energy to sustainability. Besides, FDI contributes to emissions reduction after its threshold level. Conversely, urbanization and tourism activities contribute to environmental pollution. The study outcomes stated inverted/EKC U-shaped hypotheses related to specified economies. Finally, the analysis based on the D-H panel causality test constructs exciting results.The present study concludes that economic corridor plays a vital role in tourism development, the community’s well-being, and SDGs goals (sustainable development) impact on environmental safety. The findings suggest essential and applicable policies to attain the desired sustainability level. Findings contribute to the literature on tourism, well-being, and sustainability. Further studies can use insights using this methodology.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Measuring the appropriate level of teacher compensation for different working conditions requires overcoming a number of empirical challenges, including defining and measuring differences in qualifications, effects of non-wage compensation, financial constraints, and lack of market clearing. We address those challenges in a study of teacher compensation in Alaska’s 462 public schools in 53 districts. Each of our three linked empirical specifications produces a set of different compensation adjustments needed to offset differences in working conditions across schools and communities. However, an overall pattern is clear: if districts wish to attract and retain teachers of similar qualifications across all schools, schools serving mainly racially minoritized and low-income populations will need to pay substantially more than they currently do. Estimated required compensation adjustments are quite large in some cases, illustrating the need to address working conditions and other factors that affect teachers’ choices to accept and stay in jobs at high-need schools.

          Abstract
                  <p>Intending to counteract Klein’s second discontinuity in teacher education, we explored and applied the innovation of “interface ePortfolio” in the context of a geometry course for preservice teachers (PSTs). The tool offers the possibility of implementing the design principle of profession orientation. In the article, we theoretically clarify what we understand by this principle and locate our innovative concept against this theoretical background. We empirically investigate the extent to which counteraction against the second discontinuity is successful by analyzing reflection texts created in the interface ePortfolio, focusing on PSTs’ perspectives. Our qualitative content analysis shows that most of them perceive the innovation as helpful in the intended sense and indicates that the course concept, in general, and the interface ePortfolio, in particular, have helped establish relevant links between the course content and their later work as teachers.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Students’ opportunities to persevere in making sense of mathematical ideas have long been considered significant to learning. Building on existing literature and a case study of video-based teacher collaborative sensemaking, we propose a conceptual framework for bridging perseverance and sensemaking. This framework synthesizes dispositional, metacognitive, and contextual-interactive theoretical perspectives on perseverance. Informed by these three research perspectives, the conceptual framework brings forth three interrelated mediators for bolstering perseverance practices and dispositions towards mathematical sensemaking: students’ positions as capable sensemakers, explicit problem-solving heuristics, and facilitation of student participation within their collective Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). We argue that the three mediators, when brought together, provide a holistic and generative lens for teaching and teacher learning. To illustrate the framework and its utility, we build on a case study featuring a veteran middle-school mathematics teacher across his classroom facilitation of students’ engagement with a classical mathematical task, the Tower of Hanoi, and a subsequent video-based debrief about the lesson with his colleague and our research team. We first frame the analysis around classroom events, and then investigate teacher learning opportunities in the lesson debrief. By making explicit the complex work of directing perseverance towards sensemaking, this study provides a more nuanced understanding of perseverance for teaching and teacher learning. Moreover, developing clarity around notions of perseverance in mathematics classrooms helps mitigate the potential dangers of the term being taken up in ineffective or even harmful ways.</p>

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>The EU-funded project Supporting Mathematics and Science Teachers in Addressing Diversity and Promoting Fundamental Values (MaSDiV) (2017–2020) promoted inquiry-based learning as a pedagogy that supports diverse and multicultural classrooms. This project included the design of a professional development (PD) programme for teachers. This paper explores the mismatches between acts of promotion and offering in this PD programme when it was implemented in Malta with mathematics teachers. Findings suggest that a promotion-offering mismatch, especially when a PD programme forms part of an international project, is: (1) inevitable in view of the personal interpretations that participants construe from the texts that promote the programme; and (2) costly for everyone involved and for the quality of the PD experience itself. These results position mismatches as unwelcome occurrences. While it appears impossible to eliminate mismatches completely, the argument is made that the costs of mismatches could be mitigated by developing PD content and adopting a PD model that would increase the possibilities that the implementation of a PD programme maintains fidelity to the programme’s principles. This calls for an approach to PD programme development and implementation that recognizes mismatches as a reality to be factored in from the design stage onwards.</p>

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 301-335, June 2023. <br>Interaction analyses are useful tools to examine complex socioeconomic outcomes in which the effect of one variable depends on the presence or values of another variable. Interaction effects capture simultaneous changes in two (or more) covariates, and their computation is especially challenging in nonlinear models. For such models, a statistically significant interaction-term coefficient does not necessarily indicate significant interactive effects. For analyses in which the interaction effect cannot be inferred from the model estimates, I introduce ginteff, a new command that automatically computes two- and three-way interaction effects. The command accommodates a large suite of estimation models and allows researchers to use either the partial derivative or the first difference to model the effect of the interacted variables.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 402-417, June 2023. <br>Inference for structural and treatment parameters while having high-dimensional covariates in the model is increasingly common. The Neyman-orthogonal (NO) estimators in Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Wei (2016, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 34: 606–619) produce valid inferences for the parameters of interest while using generalized linear model lasso methods to select the covariates. Drukker and Liu (2022, Econometric Reviews 41: 1047–1076) extended the estimators in Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Wei (2016) by using a Bayesian information criterion stepwise method and a testing-stepwise method as the covariate selector. Drukker and Liu (2022) found a family of data-generating processes for which the NO estimator based on Bayesian information criterion stepwise produces much more reliable inferences than the lasso-based NO estimator. In this article, we describe the implementation of posw, a command for the stepwise-based NO estimator for the high-dimensional linear, logit, and Poisson models.

They can be coalesced and can report summary statistics, correlation coefficient matrices, split-sample t tests, and regression results automatically in one .docx file.

Presumably, the multiple tests and multiple confidence are designed to help determine which parameters are responsible for a possible rejection of the overall null hypothesis of no effect. When taken by itself, each test and each confidence interval provides valid inference about the null hypothesis of no effect for each parameter at the specified error rate. However, simultaneously using two or more of these tests or confidence intervals provides inference at an error rate that exceeds the one specified.In this article, I discuss the sotable command, which provides p-values that are adjusted for the multiple tests and a confidence band that can be used to simultaneously test multiple parameters for no effect after almost all frequentist estimation commands. I also provide an introduction to the literature on simultaneous inference.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 455-490, June 2023. <br>Recently, Eckert and Vach (2020, Biometrical Journal 62: 598–609) pointed out that both confidence and comparison regions are useful tools to visualize uncertainty in a two-dimensional estimate. Both types of regions can be based on inverting Wald tests or likelihood-ratio tests. confcomptwo enables Stata users to draw both types of regions following one of the two principles for various two-dimensional estimation problems. The use of confcomptwo is illustrated by several examples.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 336-385, June 2023. <br>This article is an update to Jann (2018a, Stata Journal 18: 765–785). It contains a comprehensive discussion of the colorpalette command, including various changes and additions that have been made to the software since its first publication. Command colorpalette provides colors for use in Stata graphics. In addition to Stata’s default colors, colorpalette supports a variety of named colors, a selection of palettes that have been proposed by users, numerous collections of palettes and colormaps from sources such as ColorBrewer, Carto, D3.js, or Matplotlib, as well as color generators in different color spaces. Furthermore, a new command called colorcheck is presented that can be used to evaluate whether colors are distinguishable by people suffering from color vision deficiency.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 386-401, June 2023. <br>Besides the Wald and likelihood-ratio tests, the Lagrange multiplier test (Rao, 1948, Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 44: 50–57; Aitchison and Silvey, 1958, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 29: 813–828; Silvey, 1959, Annals of Mathematical Statistics 30: 389–407) is the third canonical approach to testing hypotheses after maximum likelihood estimation. While the Stata commands test and lrtest implement the first two, Stata does not have an official command for implementing the third. The community-contributed boottest package (Roodman et al., 2019, Stata Journal 19: 4–60) focuses on methods of bootstrap inference and also implements the Lagrange multiplier test functionality. In this article, I introduce the new community-contributed postestimation command lgrgtest, which allows for straightforwardly using the Lagrange multiplier test after constrained maximum-likelihood estimation. lgrgtest is intended to be compatible with all Stata estimation commands that use maximum likelihood and allow for the options constraints(), iterate(), and from(). lgrgtest can also be used after cnsreg.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 578-588, June 2023. <br>The Houtman–Maks index is a measure of the size of a violation of utility-maximizing (that is, rational) behavior. In this article, we introduce the command hmindex, which calculates the Houtman–Maks index for a dataset of prices and observed choices of a consumer. The command is illustrated with an empirical application.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 23, Issue 2, Page 438-454, June 2023. <br>In this article, we introduce a new community-contributed command, xtnumfac, for estimating the number of common factors in time-series and panel datasets using the methods of Bai and Ng (2002, Econometrica 70: 191–221), Ahn and Horenstein (2013, Econometrica 81: 1203–1227), Onatski (2010, Review of Economics and Statistics 92: 1004–1016), and Gagliardini, Ossola, and Scaillet (2019, Journal of Econometrics 212: 503–521). Common factors are usually unobserved or unobservable. In time series, they influence all predictors, while in paneldata models, they influence all cross-sectional units at different degrees. Examples are shocks from oil prices, inflation, or demand or supply shocks. Knowledge about the number of factors is key for multiple econometric estimation methods, such as Pesaran (2006, Econometrica 74: 967–1012), Bai (2009, Econometrica 77: 1229–1279), Norkute et al. (2021, Journal of Econometrics 220: 416–446), and Kripfganz and Sarafidis (2021, Stata Journal 21: 659–686). This article discusses a total of 10 methods to estimate the number of common factors. Examples based on Kapetanios, Pesaran, and Reese (2021, Journal of Econometrics 221: 510–541) show that U.S. house prices are exposed to up to 10 common factors. Therefore, when one fits models with house prices as a dependent variable, the number of factors must be considered.
