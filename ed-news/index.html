          Abstract
                  <p>Research incorporating either eye-tracking technology or immersive technology (virtual reality and 360 video) into studying teachers’ professional noticing is recent. Yet, such technologies allow a better understanding of the embodied nature of professional noticing. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine how teachers’ eye-gaze in immersive representations of practice correspond to their attending to children’s mathematics. Using a mixed methods approach, we incorporated eye-tracking technology embedded within a virtual reality environment to compare novice and expert teachers’ gaze duration with quality of professional noticing. Findings and results both corroborate and extend previous research evidence about important differences in professional noticing between expert and novice teachers. Specifically, the amount of experience, and thus familiarity, teachers have with being in a classroom may affect their physical movement in both real and virtual representations of practice. Additionally, findings and results emphasize the importance of teachers’ visual focus on students’ doing of mathematics across the classroom.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Federal entitlement policies like Title III and the IDEA help grant multilingual learners (MLs) and students with disabilities (SWDs) access to public schools. Yet they have operated in ways that continue to “other” the very student populations they intend to integrate. Drawing on social network surveys and semi-structured interviews collected from one urban district over 18 months, we ask: To what degree do central office leaders share responsibility for instructional decision-making in literacy and math? And, how did organizational conditions disrupt or perpetuate the “othering” of MLs and SWDs among central office staff? Leveraging a conceptual framework of critical social network analysis and institutional theory, we found that, despite efforts to promote joint-work and shared responsibility across central office departments, regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive dimensions of the institutional environment continued to “other” special populations leaders from content-area leaders and, thus, the core of instructional decision-making.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Higher education scholars have studied white supremacy and whiteness to understand the ways racial inequity persists in the academy; however, scholars mostly focus on individual and social levels of analysis such as individual ideologies or macro systems of oppression. Recent literature on racialized organizations have begun to address whiteness, but we have yet to fully understand how whiteness functions within organizations to reproduce racial inequities and sustain white supremacy as a racialized hegemonic power. Furthermore, there is little evidence on how organizations and their leaders support or resist whiteness. In this systematic review of whiteness in higher education research from the past 20 years, I identify a gap in the literature—that whiteness in higher education organizations is under examined. To begin to redress this gap, I designed a conceptual framework that examines how white supremacy as a hegemonic and racialized power via whiteness functions and is potentially contested in higher education organizations.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>PK–12 district-level administrators have been asked to navigate an increasingly complex policy landscape concerning gender-diversity reforms. We apply sensemaking theory to examine administrators’ understanding of legal and policy protections for trans and gender diverse (TGD) students. Using 36 interviews with administrators and policy consultants, we examine whether PK-12 district administrators (a) know about existing legal and policy protections, (b) tie policies to administrative actions, (c) build capacity for structural gender reforms, and (d) proactively learn about gender diversity. We use these categories to delineate among resistant, emergent, and gender-inclusive leadership approaches along the Gender-Inclusivity Leadership Spectrum. Our findings suggest PK–12 leaders would benefit from additional implementation strategies and education concerning gender diversity, even in states with protective legislative mandates for TGD people in schools.

          Abstract
                  <p>The study aimed to advance knowledge into what is data-ing, a process defined whereby people engage with data, how and why they were gathered, and how they will be used in the future. Utilising a novel interdisciplinary approach, first-year microeconomics and humanities students wrote contextualized stories as part of their coursework in 2022 and 2023. Neither course taught statistics, with contextualised storytelling defined here as a process that involves learners drawing on one’s identity or life experiences, including things they do, and that have happened to them, their families, friends, or communities. Nine participants volunteered for the exploratory study, each submitting one story to the researchers. Four stories were selected based on showing the most potential for research purposes. Data analysis saw the researchers annotate and code the four participants’ stories, then analyse critical events. Tentative findings revealed how data-ing using contextualised storytelling might help students make sense of discipline specific concepts in courses that are rich in statistical language. The activity of data-ing also suggests students can identify variables and use statistical or mathematical statements that they may or may not be aware of, suggesting there may be value in embedding statistics into non-statistics disciplines to support student learning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Using structural equation modeling, a previous study investigated the longitudinal relationships of role-related mathematics identity, efficacy, and interest to grade 12 mathematics performance. The results indicated that both mathematics identity and educational expectations at grade 11 were statistically and substantively significant predictors of grade 12 mathematics achievement in the presence of other factors such as grade 9 mathematics achievement, high school mathematics coursetaking, educational expectations at grades 9 and 11, as well as student and school background socio-demographic factors. The current study uses multiple group structural equation modeling and shows that the model derived in the previous study holds for males and females equally well. The study also found that females’ levels of motivation (except for interest) were lower than males’ at both points in time and that the males’ and females’ means on the motivation variables declined equally from grade 9 to grade 11. Implications of the findings are discussed.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Leaders from marginalized groups disproportionately shoulder emotional labor resulting from the work of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in higher education. This emotional burden can lead to stress and mental health consequences. Institutions bear the responsibility of addressing the emotional burden. This multiple-case qualitative study aimed to identify effective institutional strategies to alleviate emotional labor. We interviewed 107 leaders at eight institutions to examine their experiences with emotional labor and institutional support. We selected institutions based on their progress toward DEI. Leaders were chosen based on being involved directly in the DEI work within a shared leadership effort. Drawing on Ahmed’s theory of diversity work and Zembylas’s critical emotional praxis, we identified the following themes: sharing DEI responsibilities with many leaders, creating spaces for emotions, and role-modeling the desired behaviors to build positive relationships and trust. Through these strategies, institutions can reduce emotional labor and create equitable environments for DEI leaders.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Early colleges are a model of schooling that combines the high school and college experiences, providing students the opportunity to simultaneously earn a high school diploma and an associate degree or 2 years of college credit. This article updates findings from a 17-year longitudinal experimental study of the model, examining the impact of the model on postsecondary performance and completion. The study found positive impacts on overall degree completion, with very large impacts on associate degree completion. There were also positive impacts on bachelor’s degree completion for low-income students and first-generation college-goers. For students who enrolled in a public 4-year institution, the study found positive impacts on advanced coursetaking. There was no difference between treatment and comparison students on final college GPA or on the percentage of students who double-majored. Treatment students who earned a bachelor’s degree did so more quickly than comparison students.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>A new generation of science curriculum materials is being developed and made widely available across K–12. These materials, along with their associated professional learning, are expected to play a pivotal role in transforming science instruction to meet the vision of A Framework for K–12 Science Education and the performance expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards. This study investigated one of the first widely available middle school curriculum programs designed for the NGSS, Amplify Science 6–8. The study team conducted a randomized experiment to examine the implementation and efficacy of the middle school curriculum program (materials plus teacher professional learning) for improving seventh grade students’ learning in physical science. Findings show that students in schools where the program was implemented significantly outperformed peers in the comparison condition on an NGSS-focused physical science assessment. These findings underscore the importance of conducting additional research on NGSS-designed curriculum programs across other grade levels and within different science domains.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>In this critical qualitative study, we draw on interviews with sitting Presidents of Color in one state to explore the racialized dimensions of the college and university presidential search and appointment process. Informed by Ray’s racialized organization tenets of whiteness as a credential and racialized agency, our findings show that participants felt hyper-scrutinized and judged against white, masculine standards, norms, and expectations and had to endure explicit and implicit undermining of their potential for campus leadership. Our findings provide practice implications and recommendations for making presidential searches and appointments in higher education more racially equitable and inclusive.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Restorative justice has the potential to re-frame schools as caring and politically conscious educational spaces. As it moves to the mainstream, however, it risks being co-opted by the carceral logics that undergird the schooling of Black students in the United States. This ethnographic analysis interrogates how restorative justice provides opportunity to politicize care within the boys mentoring group at one predominantly Black high school. Specifically, the adults used the restorative circle to (1) express verbal and physical affection and (2) evoke and acknowledge shared emotions, while also (3) recognizing the positionalities and lived experiences of the Black boys in the circle and (4) co-constructing socioemotional and cognitive-behavioral tools to navigate the structures that surround them. We argue that this politicized caring is crucial to ensuring restorative practices optimize their anti-carceral potential.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Years ago, a groundbreaking review of student data from the 2013–2014 school year indicated that Black students were overrepresented among those experiencing punishment in a variety of contexts. In the intervening decade, new data has emerged, schools have implemented policies to reduce racial disparities, researchers have highlighted new methods of measuring disparities, and pundits have reignited debates about the degree and pervasiveness of disparities. Clarity is needed. Are Black students experiencing more exclusion and punishment than their peers? If so, of what kinds and in what contexts? This article responds by reviewing the most recent federal data, measuring Black overrepresentation across six types of punishment, three comparison groups, 16 subpopulations, and seven types of measurement. We generate 1,581 unique estimates of Black overrepresentation and find evidence that, no matter how you slice it, Black students are overrepresented among those punished. We conclude with policy recommendations to reduce widespread and enduring racial disparities.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Over one billion people globally struggle with mental ill-health, including depression, and self-harm. Mental ill-health is prevalent in lower income nations, where lack of research in implementation and policy change is further impeded by stigma and fragmented service delivery. This British Academy funded project (ARCLIGHT) developed from a ‘pre-bid stage’ in partnership with key Guyanese stakeholders. The project was a participatory action research study (PAR) across three differing Guyanese communities. Its objective was to co-create a community-based mental health improvement programme. A key component included supporting participants recording their digital stories of successful practices using mobile phones linked to local Wi-Fi systems. The study contributed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of improving wellbeing and health, enhancing gender equality, and reducing social and economic inequalities and meeting the World Health Organisation’s strategic priorities for Guyana regarding mental health and violence. This interdisciplinary project considered the cultural, professional, and political barriers to mental health recovery, provided new conceptual understandings and policy-relevant evidence that addressed the global challenge of mental health, in multi-ethnic and resource-poor countries. Our collaborative approach, underpinned by PAR, encouraged behavioural change, economic independence, and enhanced local services provision.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we analyse a lesson on Thales’s theorem in a Chilean secondary school classroom through the combination of two theories: Mathematics Teachers’ Specialised Knowledge (ThMTSK) and Mathematical Working Spaces (ThMWS). Both theories, first separately and then in relation to one another, are used to analyse two tasks proposed by the teacher in the classroom following a cross-methodology for networking of theories. Through a single case study research design, a content analysis of the transcript of the video recording of the lesson was conducted. The joint analysis of this lesson allows us to better understand the mathematical work taking place in the classroom. In particular, the results show the scope of each model and their complementarity through the detection of meeting points and blind spots, through the role of proof, representations, and the change between geometrical and numerical work in teaching Thales’s theorem. This allows for a deeper understanding of a teacher’s practice and teaching. Ultimately, relationships between the theoretical elements of both theories are established to show their complementarity. We conclude that networking between theories can contribute to the development of these theories by raising questions that involve examining their foundations and assumptions in greater depth.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Evolving or stagnant immigration laws and policies may distinctly shape the experiences of undocumented students by shifting access to rights or opportunities. I draw upon 30 interviews with college students in California to analyze how they encountered legal vulnerability. I argue that legal vulnerability can be dismissed, dormant, or deep-rooted, producing contrasting experiences. Inclusive state and institutional policies set the stage for some students to dismiss legal vulnerability and decouple vulnerability from their academic experiences. However, most encountered dormant legal vulnerability through awakened racist xenophobia following the 2016 presidential election and deep-rooted legal vulnerability via persistent uncertainty about their futures or worries over family. Distracted students lost focus, motivation, and study time, which impacted their classroom participation and overall academic performance. Yet, they attempted to improve their academic engagement with limited effectiveness. Altogether, I theorize the relationship between different types of legal vulnerability and undocumented students’ college experiences.

          Abstract
                  <p>Advancements in computing and statistical analyses have significantly transformed mathematics education, integrating it with data and computer science. As big data becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding its complexities, including its unique uncertainties, is crucial. This study explores the uncertainty that novice students can articulate during their initial engagement with big data, including both data preparation activities or data-ing as well as data analysis activities. Consistent with prior research on students’ engagement with small data, we offer a case study revealing that novices can also exhibit extreme views of uncertainty while engaging with big data. Contrary to the context of small data engagement, our analysis revealed different sources for these extreme views. The classification we used can offer means to identify students’ uncertainty views and support them in developing a more balanced, mature, perception of uncertainty. Moreover, the analysis underscores students’ inclination towards high-uncertainty articulations during their initial encounters with big data-ing activities.</p>
