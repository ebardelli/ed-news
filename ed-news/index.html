          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Holistic admissions practices require evaluating an applicant’s credentials in light of the opportunities available in their high school context. High school grades, test scores, and course taking are clearly related to college grades, retention, and graduation. But does performance in high school context also relate to college success? Building a unique dataset of 2.3 million students in a Midwestern state, we find that contextualized indicators of high school grades and standardized tests are strongly associated with student success in college, validating their use in holistic admissions. Contextualized grades have a stronger and more consistent association with college success than contextualized test scores, and may be most helpful at test-optional, test-free, and broader-access colleges that have yet to adopt holistic admissions practices.

          Abstract
                  <p>In Mathematics Education (ME), research dealing with topic-specific (TS) issues (e.g., what levels of development exist in learning fractions) produces usually local results and is considered less fashionable and attractive for innovative research projects than research dealing with context-specific (CS) issues that have more general and abstract scopes (e.g., what is mathematical instruction? what is the field of ME?) and produces middle-range or grand theories. TS- and CS-research run along separate tracks with little or no crossover, at least from the beginning of the socio-political-turn in ME, but connecting them could help to single out hidden variables in CS-research. This paper shows that TS-research creates specific mathematical objects that allow us to reduce the distance between these two lines of research. Mathematical objects specific to ME research are shown to be both a technical link between the two lines of research because they allow topic-specificity to access more abstract and general realms of research, as well as factor at stake when aspects related to the social, political, and ethical implications of the ontological creativity of TS-research are discussed in a critical postmodern approach. Discussing its impact on textbooks, teacher-training, teaching practices, further TS-research-practices, as well as on the researcher’s epistemological empowerment and on the self-referentiality of ME research, TS-research moves from the periphery to the heart of CS-research.</p>

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The World Bank has been called the most influential organization in education reform globally. Not only is it the single largest funder of education for international development, but it also produces knowledge, circulates discourse, and structures policymaking processes in ways that extend its influence far beyond its primary role as a bank. However, while much literature has been produced about the World Bank, the field of education lacks a systematic discussion of what has been reported about how the World Bank influences policy formation at the country level. Through the conduct of a theoretically informed systematic literature review of 70 publications, this article clarifies and provides examples for the numerous ways that the World Bank influences policy formation. In all, the article documents 11 pathways through which the World Bank influences policymaking. The article concludes by suggesting areas where research on the World Bank can be improved, namely, through more explicit attention to the theoretical and methodological approaches employed. The goal of this review is to encourage scholars to be more specific in their conceptualizations and discussions of World Bank influence, to go beyond general claims of policy imposition or agenda shaping.

          Abstract
                  <p>Incorporating an evidence-based approach in STEM education using data collection and analysis strategies when learning about science concepts enhances primary students’ discipline knowledge and cognitive development. This paper reports on learning activities that use the nature of viscosity and the power of informal statistical inference to build students’ conceptual understanding of interpolation and extrapolation without imposing on them the demands of understanding the nonlinear mathematics used to explore the concepts at the tertiary level. An exploratory research strategy was adopted to investigate the way in which Year 5 students created and analysed graphical representations from data collected when performing viscosity experiments. The data representations produced by the students and their subsequent predictions were analysed using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) model as adapted specifically for graphical representations. The results illustrate that when provided with appropriate technological tools to scaffold student learning, in this case TinkerPlots™, development of students’ appreciation of interpolation and extrapolation within meaningful data contexts across the STEM curriculum does not have to wait until the tertiary level.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>A tertiary course in Quantitative Reasoning (QR) has the potential to develop key practical and intellectual skills for citizenship, such as critical thinking, problem solving, quantitative literacy, and oral and written communication. In this article, we present research conducted on four instructors of such a QR course for students enrolled in a wide variety of nonscience degree programs at a university in the United States. The course used a student-inquiry approach to proportional reasoning, probability, statistical reasoning, and mathematical modeling. The findings are framed by a 5 C model of QR, which entails Critical thinking to link real-world Contexts to mathematical Concepts supported by student Collaboration and QR Competencies. The research addressed the questions of how university instructors support student development of the skills needed for critical citizenship and how this support relates to the 5 C model. We found that three of the four instructors viewed critical thinking as a central goal of the QR course and as supporting citizenship education. All four engaged students in tasks designed to develop a combination of skills associated citizenship, including critical thinking, self-questioning, collaboration, and communication. The discussion addresses such issues as the course’s merits and challenges, student engagement, the relative importance of the five Cs, the importance of instructional autonomy, and recommendations for related professional development and future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Armed with half a decade of experience as editor of vinculum, 4 years of writing the regular column “Math Ed Matters by MatthewMaddux” for The Variable, and as lead editor of Selected Writings from the Journal of the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ Society, I can safely say that the reports of the death of the Journal of the Saskatchewan Mathematics Teachers’ Society (SMTS) have been greatly exaggerated — until now. I mean, sure, with all due respect, and as a member of the executive of the SMTS myself, the journal kind of carries on as the subscript, which is a series of links compiled by the SMTS executive. Looked at from an old-man-yells-at-cloud perspective, emailing a few links out is a far cry from the mountain of material found printed in the many, many pages of the Journal of the SMTS, differently named as The Mathematics Newsletter, The SMTS Newsletter, SMTS Journal, Journal of the SMTS, vinculum, and The Variable over the past 60 years. I should know, after all, I led an extensive excavation of math teacher journal materials here in Western Canada. This article, then, is a quasi-autopsy of the journal. Rest in Peace, Journal of the SMTS. You deserve it.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, a team of teacher educators collectively think through the many possibilities of how concepts such as decolonization, abolition, and fugitivity intersect with and are taken up by teacher education programs. To do so, we undertook a critical interpretive synthesis of scholarly literature spanning 2000 to 2020 to locate, examine, and organize existing examples of teacher education programs that work to transgress hegemonic colonial models of education. We revisit de Oliveira Andreotti et al.’s social cartography as a framework for comparing the theoretical foundations and social implications of each teacher education program.

          Abstract
                  <p>This narrative review of current research on gender and mathematics covers the years 2020 to 2022. The number of exemplary publications within these 3 years and the diversity of topics, theoretical frameworks, subjects, and authors are indications of gender and mathematics remaining a robust and evolving area of study. Of particular interest are studies of lived experiences of students in secondary school and university programs, many of which featured continuing and troubling discriminatory incidents. In addition, the focus in several studies on the intersectionality of gender with race and other identity features is a commendable trend that should be continued. Similar to the transition from sex differences to gender differences that emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, in the papers examined, some authors have reconceptualized gender as a fluid, non-binary construct, although most gender data are reported in binary ways. Gender remains a focus of research in mathematics education because of persistent inequities in achievement, attitudes, representation, and lived experiences.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>As in many countries, for decades in Aotearoa (New Zealand), we have heard the story of the Pacific and Māori achievement gap in mathematics. This has become a widely accepted part of beliefs constructed across multiple communities about students and schools and who can do and learn mathematics successfully. A common response by policy makers and educators alike is to fix the problem of those deemed academically bleak by putting in place a range of interventions. In this article, we challenge the positioning of Pacific students as a problem to be fixed and instead focus on how we can address the practices inherent in historical forms of institutionalised racism related to colonisation. We use an Indigenous research model—Tivaevae—to develop an exemplary case study of the teachers and students from one low socio-economic urban school as they were involved in conscientisation and the reconstitution of educational practices to privilege indigenous knowledge systems. The findings highlight one model of how teachers and students can change institutionalised Western world practices in the mathematics classroom. We argue that the shift to honouring indigenous knowledge systems and a strength-based approach provided opportunities for Pacific students to learn mathematics in ways that supported them to build strong mathematical dispositions, and rather than being assimilated, retain their cultural identity.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In this study we employed regression analysis and between-group matched pair design to analyze whether participation in a competency-based education pilot was associated with improved high school completion and postsecondary entry. Data were obtained for high schools participating in a CBE pilot program in Illinois. Results of the matched pair design showed that CBE participation was significantly associated with higher rates of high school graduation for seniors across all groups with differences significant overall (97.2% for CBE vs. 93.1% for non-CBE), for White students (97.2% vs. 92.7%), and for students eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (96.3% vs. 90.3%). Graduation rate for seniors was also higher for African American students and for Hispanic-Latinx students, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the matched pair design, CBE participation was not significantly associated with entry into college within 12 months of high school.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Three trends have characterized state policymaking for higher education in the 21st century: divestment, accountability, and race neutrality. These policy agendas are often justified as an attempt to optimize system efficiency and performance by making institutional actors (agents) responsive to the demands of state officials (principals). In this manuscript, we present quantitative evidence that these three policy initiatives have not achieved their stated purpose. We use contemporary social theory to explain why this is the case. Finally, we call for deeper re-engagement of states and their higher education systems in place of transactional and technocratic models.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Youth voter turnout remains stubbornly low and unresponsive to civic education. Rigorous evaluations of the effects of adopting civics tests for high school graduation by some states on youth voter turnout remain limited. We estimate the impact of a recent, state-mandated civics test policy—the Civics Education Initiative (CEI)—on youth voter turnout by exploiting spatial and temporal variation in the adoption of CEI across states. Using nationally representative data from the 1996 to 2020 Current Population Survey and a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that CEI does not significantly affect youth voter turnout. Our null results, largely insensitive to a variety of alternative specifications and robustness checks, provide evidence regarding the lack of efficacy of civics test policies when it comes to youth voter participation.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Education research increasingly conceptualizes how social interactions and contexts of public schools replicate practices found in prisons. Yet prison-schooling is often left out of education research. Concurrently, prison-schooling is where we educate a disproportionate amount of multiply marginalized youth, specifically disabled Girls of Color. The lack of attention to prison-schools has limited how teaching in youth carceral facilities can be examined for its challenges and supports of disabled Girls of Color. Centering the girls’ words from class observations, field notes, and interviews, this study describes and intervenes in dehumanizing and (de)socializing mechanisms in prison-school education. We explore attempts and impacts of countering prison-school education through a sociocritical literacy course infused with an abolitionist praxis. We end with discussion on the limits of countering prison-school through courses alone, suggesting abolition across multiple scales instead.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>A portion of EL-identified youth want to exit the EL instructional services to which they are legally entitled. Moreover, institutionalized adultism within EL policy does not provide youths a role in decision-making about these services. As a result, little is known about how individuals who attempt unsanctioned exits conceptualize EL instructional services. This study uses an intersectional anti-adultism conceptual lens to analyze the retrospective interviews of 35 women of color who attempted to exit EL instructional services during their K–12 schooling. The findings highlight three dominant themes in participants’ conceptualizations of EL instructional services: they were academically limiting, socially isolating, and that placement in these services was a product of racism. Moreover, this detailed analysis evidenced how schooling transitions impacted participants’ conceptualization of EL instructional services. These findings have implications for how research, policy, and practice can center EL-identified youths’ decision-making and disrupt their experiences of marginalization.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The historical record reveals that in the final opinion of the landmark school segregation case Cooper v. Aaron, the U.S. Supreme Court justices intentionally used the term “desegregation” rather than “integration” to soften the ire of those opposed to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. The justices believed that Southern resisters to integrations would find the former term “a shade less offensive” than the latter. In this lecture, education scholar and sociologist Prudence Carter reverses that logic and discusses why educational practices of “radical inclusion” are “a shade less offensive” today than mere desegregation in light of persistent educational disparities by race, ethnicity, and class. Carter draws on her original research and other social science evidence to show why societies marred by social and economic divides continue to struggle with the realization of integration in schools and communities. In her commentary on multiple dimensions of educational inequality, she highlights policies and evidence-based practices that have the potential to bring us closer to equity in schools and society.

          Abstract
                  <p>Tasks play an important role in mathematics education, as they provide opportunities for students to develop their competencies and to cognitively engage with the mathematical content. The potential for cognitive activation as a central feature of a mathematical task has been considered in numerous studies, mostly as a didactical analysis by means of existing classification systems. In this study, which has been carried out in the frame of the TEDS research program, a different approach is taken by which we aim to identify the cognitive demand level of tasks used in ordinary mathematics lessons. Thus, the correlation between general mathematical competencies and the cognitive mathematical activities required to solve the task was analyzed and common properties of groupings of tasks were empirically extracted. In detail, 2490 tasks from mathematics lessons in Germany were analyzed by means of a rational task analysis with regard to their potential for fostering general mathematical competencies, namely modelling, problem solving, reasoning and argumentation, use of representations, use of symbols and operations, and communication. Latent class analysis revealed six classes of mathematical tasks with varying potential for the different competencies. In accordance with previous studies on mathematical tasks in Germany, the biggest class focused solely on the use of symbols and operations, while other classes showed different foci. Post hoc analyses revealed that the classes of tasks differ with regard to the level of cognitive activity they require. The results of the study highlight that the potential for cognitive activation of the tasks used in the classrooms of this more recent study has not improved in the last decades, despite many reform activities in German mathematics education, and that many mathematical tasks used are still more or less calculation oriented.</p>
