          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item-level count data frequently arise in cognitive, educational, and psychological assessments. Correctly handling different dispersion levels in count data is crucial for accurate statistical inference. This research proposes a Quasi-Poisson item response theory model that accommodates overdispersion, underdispersion, and equidispersion in count data, aiming to explicitly model the connection between the mean and variance parameters, providing a method that is both computationally efficient and statistically robust. This semiparametric model specifies the first two conditional moments for the count variables and derives marginal moments to estimate model parameters. Simulation studies demonstrate the Quasi-Poisson model’s efficacy in parameter recovery across different dispersion scenarios and its negligible computation time. Empirical data analysis further underscores the model’s superior fit and computational efficiency in a real-world setting.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Two-way dual-language immersion (TWDL) programs aim to combine English speakers and speakers of a partner language in the same classroom to receive content instruction in both languages. Stated goals include bilingualism and biliteracy, high academic achievement, and sociocultural competence. In school districts aiming to reduce segregation, TWDL programs also can integrate students from diverse linguistic, racial, and economic backgrounds, although mounting evidence shows that equitable integration does not always happen. Using school-level enrollments and district data on TWDL program growth from 2000 to 2021, this paper describes enrollment and segregation patterns across the Los Angeles Unified School District elementary schools with TWDL programs. We find that elementary schools with TWDL programs are enrolling increasing numbers of racially, linguistically, and economically marginalized students and are generally more diverse than schools without TWDL programs, although there appear to be limits on the potential of TWDL programs to foster diversity, especially in a segregated urban context.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>This case study examines the connections between mindfulness activities and related benefits, including wellness, as 13 Black fifth graders embarked on an 8-week mindfulness program in their public-school classroom. The children responded well to the program and exhibited some wellness outcomes associated with mindfulness. However, hegemonic school and classroom practices emphasizing adult control and minimal child agency prevented the children from practicing new mindfulness skills or sustaining feelings of wellness, mattering, and harmony throughout the school day. We found that classroom mindfulness efforts, when not supported by all classroom teachers and administrators, necessarily limit Black children’s ability to develop a sense of self-awareness and self-efficacy and can in fact reinforce feelings of self-blame. Our findings suggest that mindfulness programs can have a positive impact for Black children when paired with antiracist practices, allowing space for the children to practice refusal and prioritize their right to matter.

          Abstract
                  <p>Explanatory videos play an important role in the flipped classroom (FC) approach, which has become highly important especially since the COVID-19 crisis. In this qualitative study, we explore the potential of using explanatory videos (EVs) in mathematical modelling education as important component of FC and assess its merits and deficiencies. We focus on the perspectives and experiences of 44 preservice mathematics teachers (PSTs) attending a German university in their master phase. Considering EVs in an interactive FC context, we employed a multifaceted approach to data collection that included interviews, online surveys with open-ended questions, EVs generated by the PSTs, and written documents resulting from collaborative group activities. The findings show that the EVs used in FCs in modelling can enhance understanding and simplifying modelling content and real-world situations. Moreover, PSTs report that using EVs in flipped modelling seminars can offer personalized learning, optimize teaching hours, decrease anxiety, and increase learners’ attention. PSTs also improved their skills in developing EVs on modelling and evaluating their quality in terms of structure, content, and focus. The experienced challenges include time-consuming content development, workload, technical hurdles, and feasibility of FC implementations. Although these challenges are important, they are not content-specific issues, and we conclude that the notable benefits of using EVs in FCs have the potential to promote technology-enhanced modelling education.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article, we report on an Australian study in which generic, specific, and catalytic enablers of mathematical modelling are identified and described. The study adopted a design-based research approach involving six secondary teachers, and their intact classes, over three years. Data was generated from 60 pre/post-teacher and student (Years 9–11) interviews, which was subject to reductive thematic analysis, consistent with the principles of inductive category formation. This analysis led to the development of a Typology for Instructional Enablers of Mathematical Modelling which identifies and describes both enablers and un-enablers of modelling activity. These are related to external/internal/personal learning goals, classroom expectations and ways of working, management of the learning process, and instructional anticipation. Enablers/un-enablers are further categorised into generic, specific, and catalytic dimensions. Implications for both practice and future research are discussed, including the nature of catalytic enablers and the connections between enablers and specific aspects of the modelling process.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we discuss our experience in collaborating with mathematicians to increase their use of active learning pedagogy in a proof-based linear algebra course. The mathematicians we worked with valued using active learning pedagogy to increase student engagement but were reluctant to use active learning pedagogy due to time constraints. Our mathematicians perceived obligations in their teaching that increased the time it would take to implement some of the active learning pedagogy that we suggested, leading them to view this pedagogy as inviable. By attending to mathematicians’ obligations, we were able to design active learning strategies that met the interests and needs of the mathematics educators and mathematicians collaborating on this project.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This research examines a 58-year, 202 sequential issues, longitudinal published record of the Ontario Mathematics Gazette. The publication is oriented to K–12 teachers of mathematics in Ontario. A total of 3609 units of analysis were identified that led to 447 unique index categories. A chi-squared goodness of fit test found, within the limits of the test, that these categories arise continuously, independently, and at a steady rate. The frequency of occurrence in both absolute and relative terms showed a few trends, such as the shift of curriculum development away from teachers and toward research findings. A key finding was the absence of significant biases or short-term trends within the publication’s history. This speaks to the association being an independent voice, but the breadth of topics indicates it is an important support for teachers.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Thursday, 16. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent data show rising suicidality among high school girls. We posit this increase may be related to an overlooked factor: more girls identifying as LGBQ. Using four cohorts of national Youth Risk Behavior Survey data (N = 22,562 females, N = 22,130 males), we found that LGBQ identification among females rose from 15% in 2015 to 34% in 2021. LGBQ females consistently reported higher suicidality, although rates remained stable within both LGBQ and heterosexual groups. The rise in females’ suicidality may stem from social pressures faced by LGBQ youth. Male suicidality and LGBQ identification showed smaller changes. More support for LGBQ students is essential to address this trend.

          Abstract
                  <p>The reasons for teaching programming in school are indeed manifold. Programming can for example be utilized as a vehicle for understanding and learning particular mathematical subject matter, or as a tool for solving mathematical problems. In this paper, however, we propose to utilize programming as a vehicle for developing mathematical competencies such as problem-solving, exploration, modeling, reasoning, representation, generalization, and abstraction. We perform a design study utilizing a systematic, iterative development process for designing teaching sessions, focusing on one mathematical competence at a time. We apply the proposed methodology on a set of teaching sessions that are developed, implemented, and tested in a range of classroom settings. Based on this development process, we conclude that programming can be used to develop mathematical competencies. Furthermore, we identify a set of teacher practices that can be used to facilitate mathematical competence development in programming activities.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Feedback and preservice teachers’ (PSTs’) clinical practice/field experiences are vital for their learning. Understanding influences on field supervisors’ feedback is critical, especially for preparing dual language bilingual education (DLBE) teachers because it requires specialized knowledge—yet systematic guidelines and programs for DLBE teacher preparation are lacking. We conducted a collaborative autoethnography to determine how our identities and experiences with language and DLBE related to our feedback and supervision of DLBE PSTs. We analyzed and discussed the narratives we wrote about our experiences and the feedback we provided while supervising 13 Spanish–English bilingual PSTs in elementary DLBE classrooms. Our identities and experiences, which were influenced by families, education, language histories, geography, and sociopolitical contexts, influenced our feedback. Considering identities and experiences illuminates what is (sometimes unconsciously) prioritized and ignored in feedback. Engaging in deep reflection is important for continued support of supervisors and PSTs.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>In this philosophical paper, we argue that youth sports, both in and out of schools, are a largely unrealized space for democratic/civic education. Where youth sports leagues used to be low cost, local, and inclusive, much has changed over the last several decades. We are now in the neoliberal era of exclusive, privatized, and professionalized youth sports. Drawing on Dewey’s robust conception of democracy and Talisse’s concerns about partisan polarization, we argue that youth sports should be spaces to develop democratic habits, dispositions, and values. We explore the benefits of youth sports as well as current challenges, including excessive costs and pressure, disrupted families, and hyperindividualism. We end by offering suggestions for reforming youth sports to recenter their educational and democratic potential and value, including supporting loosely structured play, modeling democratic behavior, teaching democratic habits directly, and learning from more progressive national sports models.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Official development agencies are increasingly supporting civil society lobby and advocacy (L&amp;A) to address poverty and human rights. However, there are challenges in evaluating L&amp;A. As programme objectives are often to change policies or practices in a single institution like a Government Ministry, L&amp;A programmes are often not amenable to large-n impact evaluation methods. They often work in strategic partnerships to foster change; hence, contribution may be a more relevant evaluation question than attribution. Small-n qualitative approaches are available to measure the effectiveness of L&amp;A which use the theory of change as their analytical framework. We conducted a meta-evaluation of 36 evaluations of multi-component international programmes to support civil society L&amp;A across Asia, Africa and Latin America, comprising the majority of programmatic support from one international donor. We assessed the confidence in causal claims in the evaluations using a new tool that we developed. Assessments of the contribution of the programmes to the changes in outcomes were not provided in many of the evaluations, nor were predictable sources of bias addressed. Given that L&amp;A programmes are likely to adopt an influencing approach where many different inside-track and outside-track engagement objectives, opportunities and strategies are attempted, many of which might be expected to fail, there appeared to be a clear bias in the evaluations towards reporting outcomes that were achieved, ignoring those that were not. We provide guidance on how to improve the design, conduct and reporting of small-n qualitative evaluations of aid effectiveness.

                  <p>Inferentialism has emerged as a valuable theoretical resource in mathematics education. As a theory of meaning about the use and content of concepts, it offers a fresh perspective on traditional epistemological and linguistic questions in the field. Despite its emergence, important inferentialist ideas still need to be operationalized. In this paper, I operationalize multiple inferentialist concepts to analyze prospective secondary mathematics teachers’ learning about graphs and quantitative and covariational reasoning in a mathematics content course. I use Robert Brandom’s ideas about upstream, downstream, and incompatible inferences to illustrate the inferentialist mastering metaphor for learning and Brandom’s ideas about objectivity. My analysis shows (a) inferentialism’s capacity to address epistemological issues like objectivity and conceptual understanding, (b) the importance of attending to different types of inferences to assess learning from an inferentialist perspective, and (c) how the development of mastery is associated with virtues. I conclude by identifying the study’s potential limitations and trajectories for future research.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Novice teachers improve substantially in their first years on the job, but we know remarkably little about the nature of this skill development. Using data from Tennessee, we leverage a feature of the classroom observation protocol that asks school administrators to identify an item on which the teacher should focus their improvement efforts. This “area of refinement” overcomes a key measurement challenge endemic to inferring from classroom observation scores the development of specific teaching skills. We show that administrators disproportionately identify two skills when observing novice teachers: classroom management and presenting content. Struggling with classroom management, in particular, is associated with early career attrition. Using a returns to experience framework, we observe improvement in these skills among teachers who remain.
