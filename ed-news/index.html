          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article I describe and reflect on my evolving undestandings of the study of mentoring since the publication of the 2005 article in the Journal of Teacher Education. My reflective journey suggests stressing two assertions to the study of mentoring. One, that there is a need to develop a more multidimensional and integrated conception of mentoring which draws on integrated models of mentoring and focuses on mentor-mentee/s dyadic and collaborative interactions as units of analyis and interpretation. Two, that we should go deeper into how mentors’ sense-making of being ‘lost or found in translation’ as agents of change operates within complex fields of interaction, at multiple policy, personal and interpersonal levels. Thus. a curriculum for learning to mentor should also include contents related to policy learning. I elaborate on these undestandings throughout the paper.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>National policies have targeted widespread exclusionary discipline in schools which is associated with negative academic outcomes. Principals play an important role in making disciplinary decisions, yet little is understood about how their mindsets might impact these decisions. We hypothesized that principals’ mindsets regarding the purpose of discipline (exclusion vs. prevention) would predict their responses to misbehavior. In a random, nationwide sample (N = 234), principals responded to misbehavior by a hypothetical Black or White student. Exclusion beliefs predicted more severe discipline, whereas prevention beliefs predicted greater endorsement of referring the student to a school counselor. Principal mindsets also predicted exclusionary discipline in real-world contexts.

          Abstract
                  <p>Young children’s spatial reasoning is critical to mathematics learning from an early age. Recent reviews have drawn attention to the importance of mathematical experiences in the early years; however, an explicit focus on research in spatial reasoning can contribute to a more coherent account of the field. This paper reports a scoping review of qualitative studies (n = 37) during the years 2009–2021. The studies analysed in this review provide insight into children’s embodied spatial concepts and non-verbal expressions such as gesture and the relationship between spatial reasoning and mathematics learning in early childhood (birth to 8 years). Four main themes were found: (i) children’s manipulation and transformation of objects, (ii) children’s bodily engagement with and within spaces, (iii) children’s representation and interpretation of spatial experiences, and (iv) contexts for spatial learning. While the review illuminates a deeper awareness and a more holistic and embodied view of children’s spatial competencies, there remains few studies focussed on children under three years of age. Future directions for ongoing research are identified.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics education research has been aware that calculus students can draw on single definite integrals as a model to compute areas (SImA), without minding whether the function changes its sign in the assigned interval. In this study, I take conceptual and empirical steps to understand this phenomenon in more depth. Building on Fischbein’s theory, I conceptualize area as a figural concept and associate its calculation with intra-mathematical modelling routes that pass through the network of figures and integrals. To characterize these routes, I analyzed video clips that students in a large first-year service course in mathematics submitted as part of their coursework. This led to the construction of an analytical cycle explicating the models that students generated when implementing SImA. To appreciate how widespread SImA can be, I use the responses of nearly twelve thousand students in final multiple-choice exams in the same course over a decade. This analysis found that nearly thirty percent of the students chose answers that are consistent with this model of reasoning; in some exams the SImA-options were selected more frequently than the correct answers. Drawing on these findings, I make several teaching-oriented comments about the relations between areas and definite integrals.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>One of the ways in which students can be taught science is by doing science, the intention being to help students understand the nature, processes, and methods of science. Investigative research projects may be used in an attempt to reflect some aspects of science more authentically than other teaching and learning approaches, such as confirmatory practical activities and teacher demonstrations. In this article, we are interested in the affordances of investigative research projects where students, either individually or collaboratively, undertake original research. We provide a critical rather than a systematic review of the field. We begin by examining the literature on the aims of science education, and how science is taught in schools, before specifically turning to investigative research projects. We examine how such projects are typically undertaken before reviewing their aims and, in more detail, the consequences for students of undertaking such projects. We conclude that we need social science research studies that make explicit the possible benefits of investigative research projects in science. Such studies should have adequate control groups that look at the long-term consequences of such projects not only by collecting delayed data from participants, but by following them longitudinally to see whether such projects make any difference to participants’ subsequent education and career destinations. We also conclude that there is too often a tendency for investigative research projects for students in science to ignore the reasons why scientists work in particular areas and to assume that once a written report of the research has been authored, the work is done. We therefore, while being positive about the potential for investigative research projects, make specific recommendations as to how greater authenticity might result from students undertaking such projects.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Conceptually grounded curricular materials in the context of professional development programs facilitate teachers’ adoption of new pedagogies. Even though science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional development opportunities for early grade level teachers continue to receive attention, one existing challenge is to support teachers further in implementing well-defined integrated STEM curricula. The earlySTEM program supports K–4 teachers with the systematically developed earlySTEM curriculum, its associated curricular materials, and year-long mentoring. The program was implemented in 26 schools. This mid-evaluation investigated teacher perceptions of the earlySTEM program with a focus on contributions and challenges. A total of 134 teachers from the 26 schools responded to a survey with open-ended questions. Survey data were analyzed using a descriptive approach. The findings indicated that the teachers had positive experiences with the earlySTEM program. The results revealed that the earlySTEM program is perceived to have contributed to (a) teachers’ STEM teaching skills and STEM conceptualizations and (b) students’ skills development and awareness on the connection of the curriculum content to real-world problems. The results also document the perceived challenge in implementing the earlySTEM curriculum: need for more classroom time. The conclusions offer insights for similar program designs.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Understanding the development of major educational policies is essential, especially federal policies integral to Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs)—one of the fastest-growing types of postsecondary institutions in the United States, which collectively serve over two-thirds of Latina/o/x-identified college students. Accordingly, in this archive-based study, we explore the expansion of Title V, specifically the creation of the Postbaccalaureate Opportunities for Hispanic Americans Program, and how advocates framed the need for this program. Specifically, employing McBeth et al.’s policy narrative framework, we story how Congress came to enact this program, describing the setting, characters, and plot of this policy process. In doing so, we make visible via narration how federal policy unfolds and the relationship between federal and state-level policy. Additionally, we show that nationalist, capitalist, and democratic logics are often used to justify programs to support the Latina/o/x community. Considering the findings, we conclude with implications for policy and future research. Ultimately, using this innovative lens, we expand the HSI literature and complexify the understanding of Title V.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are unique in their ability to support the educational advancement of students of color. Approximately one in five postsecondary institutions are eligible for funding under an MSI designation, yet more than half of all undergraduate students of color are enrolled in such colleges and universities. However, there continues to be great disagreement and confusion about how to define MSIs. Researchers, policymakers, advocacy organizations, and even institutions themselves have advanced different and inconsistent definitions as to what might be considered an MSI. Given these contrasting constructions of MSIs, the purpose of this article is to offer a uniform definition and typology as to how MSIs should be defined and to construct an MSI dataset based upon this approach. We assert that this approach will yield more accuracy to the description and study of MSIs, which will greatly benefit and inform the work of institutional leaders, advocates, policymakers, and the broader MSI research community.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Racial inequality in exclusionary discipline is a salient educational equity issue. The implications of educators’ discretion in administering discipline and the complexity of repeated office discipline referrals (ODRs) and suspensions are reflected in school discipline policy debates nationwide. This brief uses New York City to learn more about persistently disciplined students. Black students are more likely to be persistently referred than other students. The disparities in the students who are persistently suspended are not as stark as the disparities in the students who are persistently referred. School characteristics play an essential role in predicting persistently disciplined students and the findings reinforce the value of teachers’ diversity and experience and school climate for reducing racial inequality in school discipline.

          Abstract
      
                  <p>
      Findings on children’s proportional reasoning abilities strongly vary across studies. This might be due to the different contexts that can be used in proportional problems: fair-sharing, mixtures, and probability. A review of the scientific literature suggests that the context of proportional problems may not only impact the difficulty of the problem, but that it also plays an important role in how children approach the problems. In other words, different contexts might elicit different (erroneous) thinking strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of context in third graders’ (n = 305) proportional reasoning abilities. Results showed that children performed significantly better in a fair-sharing context compared to a mixture and a probability context. No evidence was found for a difference in performance on the mixture and the probability context. However, the kind of erroneous answers that were given in the mixture and probability context differed slightly, with more additive answers in the mixture context and more one-dimensional answers in the probability context. These findings suggest that the type of answers elicited by proportional problems might depend on the specific context in which the problem is presented.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>After 20 years, the research on empathy in teacher education has grown tremendously. This concept originally explored in our article 20 years ago, raised questions regarding the type of empathy and its potential implications for preparing culturally responsive teachers. Though research on empathy has increased 3-fold, teacher educators still struggle in our preparation of effective teachers for all children. One positive step forward in this recent line of research has been the centering of empathy in a more critical frame cautioning us against the concept of inauthentic or false empathy, as well as questioning whether empathy is enough.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study was aimed at exploring the key factors affecting postgraduate students-teachers’ translation of a theoretical framework from English into their native language. The research was carried out with 21 Turkish postgraduate students who were also mathematics teachers, based on the theoretical framework of the documentational approach to didactics. The research was designed as a case study. The data were obtained from postgraduate students’ weekly translation papers, the recordings of collective translation sessions, and the researchers’ and the postgraduate students’ reflective notes over a period of 7 weeks. The data were analyzed using descriptive and content analysis in order to investigate the factors influencing difficulties the postgraduate students had while translating. The analyses showed that the task of translating a theoretical framework at the postgraduate level led student-teachers to work on the meaning of the concepts and the unity of the framework and to reinterpret the source text. The research showed that the translation of the theoretical framework was strongly influenced by syntactic, sociocultural, and academic/educational differences, and these factors were interrelated.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Our current multicultural societies require that education addresses diversity and promotes cultural awareness and intercultural learning. Mathematics and science education can also contribute to this aspect of citizenship education and create a culture of belonging for all students. Professional development that integrates intercultural learning with educational practices is still uncommon in the field of science and mathematics teacher preparation and support. This study explores the possibilities to support science and mathematics teachers in implementing intercultural learning through a professional development course. The course was developed in a European setting, based on a theoretical analysis, and tried out with 319 teachers from six participating countries. The impact of the course on teachers’ take up of intercultural learning was measured with a pre-post questionnaire. We found that the course strengthened teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and extended their teaching practices with opportunities created by cultural diversity among their students or in their subjects. In addition to that, teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs and the perceived cultural diversity in class appeared to be influencing factors for teachers’ practices. Based on our findings we recommend that the combination of intercultural learning with educational practices of mathematics and science might be a suitable gateway to provide new intercultural learning opportunities for students.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>To be successful in algebra, students need access to high-quality instruction that includes opportunities to develop their algebraic understanding. Yet research on algebra teaching suggests that instruction remains procedurally focused, indicating that teachers may need additional support to provide students such opportunities. One possible lever for improving instruction may be through curricular guidance provided to teachers, specifically through educative materials that provide support for teacher as well as student learning. This study aims to understand how curricular guidance supports teachers to enact the types of instructional practices that support students’ learning opportunities in algebra specifically, and how teachers enact that guidance. We draw from a sample of 29 video observations from six teachers of the same three textbook lessons and use aligned analytic frameworks to examine the curriculum materials and enacted lessons in tandem. We investigate how the curricular guidance provides opportunities for algebra-focused instructional features, how these opportunities are taken up by teachers, and how and in what ways differences in instructional enactments might be related to the curricular opportunities. We find differences in which instructional features varied more by lesson and which varied more by teacher and describe sources of this variation. Curricular guidance supported teachers’ enactments, but teacher-level variation was largely due to teachers going beyond the support provided. This study suggests how curriculum materials can better support teacher learning and provides insight into taking a content-focused approach to studying curricular enactment.</p>

Presenting an overview of classroom activities based on audio data, the diagrams show a variety of patterns, including each group’s progression through assigned tasks, some students’ exclusion from discussions of those tasks, and the teacher’s patterns of interaction with groups. The representations provide new ways that researchers might approach and present multilayered classroom data.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The changing educational landscape requires new organizational frameworks to understand how schools and universities make sense of and respond to broader institutional forces like accountability, diversity, and the market. In this article, we draw on recent innovations in organizational theory to propose a model that identifies two general processes through which pressures from the environment shape educational practice in schools: filtering and local adaptation. We review three areas where researchers have studied filtering and local adaptation—routines, sensemaking, and networks—to illustrate how these processes are currently being applied in education and how this work can be extended. We also identify studies that have begun to integrate these different areas of scholarship and propose directions for future research. This article offers education researchers new to the field conceptual tools for guiding their analysis and assists more seasoned researchers in situating their studies in a broader context of institutional maintenance, change, and heterogeneity.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In the wake of racial justice protests in the United States, many states adopted policies to constrain the discussion of racism, particularly contemporary and systemic racism, in K-12 classrooms. Discursively framed as “critical race theory bans,” these policies enumerate lists of “prohibited concepts” to be eliminated from classroom instruction and curriculum materials. This brief document analysis provides an overview of first-wave prohibited concepts policies among the states to adopt such policies during the 2020-2022 legislative sessions. The analysis summarizes the prohibited concepts, teaching practices that remain allowed, and the nature of the prohibitions.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Thirty years ago, “Problems, process, and promise: Reflections on a collaborative approach to the solution of the minority teacher shortage” (Goodwin, 1991) offered a perspective on an approach to the minority teacher shortage. That piece represented the start of the author’s life-long work on teacher preparation, with a particular focus on the recruitment and retention of teachers of color in response to growing numbers of students of color juxtaposed against a predominantly white teaching force. Now, several decades later, this article is her opportunity to reflect on those early thoughts, framed by the question: What progress have we made (or not) as a profession, and a society, in addressing this imperative? In pondering this question, this piece returns to the focus of the original article to think anew about problems, process, and promise as conceptual lenses for assessing how far we have come and where we now need to go.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>There is a need to better understand the complex landscape of adolescent literacy intervention as a shared responsibility across all educational stakeholders. To address this need, we examined the self-reported literacy beliefs and practices about secondary readers and literacy intervention among a group of educators (including administrators, teachers, and specialists) who participated in a year-long professional learning series focused on providing adolescents with rich and responsive literacy learning opportunities. We found that educators’ beliefs and practices shifted as they developed shared understandings of asset-based mindsets and ways of supporting students’ situated literacy learning and comprehension within disciplinary contexts. We offer suggestions for how to create shared learning opportunities for educators across roles and discuss implications for future research.
