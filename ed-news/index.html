          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Official development agencies are increasingly supporting civil society lobby and advocacy (L&amp;A) to address poverty and human rights. However, there are challenges in evaluating L&amp;A. As programme objectives are often to change policies or practices in a single institution like a Government Ministry, L&amp;A programmes are often not amenable to large-n impact evaluation methods. They often work in strategic partnerships to foster change; hence, contribution may be a more relevant evaluation question than attribution. Small-n qualitative approaches are available to measure the effectiveness of L&amp;A which use the theory of change as their analytical framework. We conducted a meta-evaluation of 36 evaluations of multi-component international programmes to support civil society L&amp;A across Asia, Africa and Latin America, comprising the majority of programmatic support from one international donor. We assessed the confidence in causal claims in the evaluations using a new tool that we developed. Assessments of the contribution of the programmes to the changes in outcomes were not provided in many of the evaluations, nor were predictable sources of bias addressed. Given that L&amp;A programmes are likely to adopt an influencing approach where many different inside-track and outside-track engagement objectives, opportunities and strategies are attempted, many of which might be expected to fail, there appeared to be a clear bias in the evaluations towards reporting outcomes that were achieved, ignoring those that were not. We provide guidance on how to improve the design, conduct and reporting of small-n qualitative evaluations of aid effectiveness.

          Abstract
                  <p>Inferentialism has emerged as a valuable theoretical resource in mathematics education. As a theory of meaning about the use and content of concepts, it offers a fresh perspective on traditional epistemological and linguistic questions in the field. Despite its emergence, important inferentialist ideas still need to be operationalized. In this paper, I operationalize multiple inferentialist concepts to analyze prospective secondary mathematics teachers’ learning about graphs and quantitative and covariational reasoning in a mathematics content course. I use Robert Brandom’s ideas about upstream, downstream, and incompatible inferences to illustrate the inferentialist mastering metaphor for learning and Brandom’s ideas about objectivity. My analysis shows (a) inferentialism’s capacity to address epistemological issues like objectivity and conceptual understanding, (b) the importance of attending to different types of inferences to assess learning from an inferentialist perspective, and (c) how the development of mastery is associated with virtues. I conclude by identifying the study’s potential limitations and trajectories for future research.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Novice teachers improve substantially in their first years on the job, but we know remarkably little about the nature of this skill development. Using data from Tennessee, we leverage a feature of the classroom observation protocol that asks school administrators to identify an item on which the teacher should focus their improvement efforts. This “area of refinement” overcomes a key measurement challenge endemic to inferring from classroom observation scores the development of specific teaching skills. We show that administrators disproportionately identify two skills when observing novice teachers: classroom management and presenting content. Struggling with classroom management, in particular, is associated with early career attrition. Using a returns to experience framework, we observe improvement in these skills among teachers who remain.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>The increasing prominence of dual-language bilingual education (DLBE) in the United States necessitates deeper understanding of institutional roles and professional identities of DLBE teachers, particularly when incongruent. We qualitatively analyzed teacher resistance in discordant situations as discussed in conferences between DLBE teachers and a bilingual instructional coach in two districts over 2 years. In these conversations, we found a distinction between nonconfrontational and open, direct resistance. We applied an agentive triad model of teacher identity, agency, and power to understand how DLBE teachers navigated discordant situations in their schools. Teachers acted from different identity positions, including agentive compliance, anagentive compliance (without agency), and nonconfrontational resistance. Findings and theorization demonstrate that DLBE programs present special considerations for teacher identity, role, and resistance. Moreover, context-specific characteristics, including program age, model, and administration, may impact teachers’ approach to resistance. Findings and theorization are relevant to successful DLBE program implementation and equity focused instructional coaching.

          Abstract
                  <p>Learning to launch problem-based lessons is challenging for prospective teachers (PTs). Teaching rehearsals offer an opportunity for PTs to practice launches in a controlled environment in which the action can be paused to discuss situations that arise. Typically, the teacher educator (TE) initiates the vast majority of these pauses, but in this study, the TE encouraged any PT to also initiate a pause in the action whenever they identified a potential learning opportunity for the class. We collected detailed data on each in-the-moment discussion in order to determine who initiates and participates in these discussions, how discussions initiated by the PTs and the TE differ in structure and substance, and whether PTs want to remember discussions with particular structures or substances. We found that over half of the discussions were initiated by PTs themselves. We also found that PTs across the class actively engaged in the in-the-moment discussions. Looking closer at the structure and substance of the discussions showed that the TE and PTs structured the discussions in similar ways, but there were some differences in the substance of those discussions. We also found that PTs were more likely to want to remember discussions they had initiated as well as those that were framed as highlighting a productive move.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In the contemporary educational landscape characterised by performativity pressures, schools face increasing scrutiny regarding their students’ mathematical outcomes. Inquiry-based approaches in mathematics education offer promising potential to enhance reasoning and problem-solving capabilities across diverse student populations. However, the transition from teacher-centred methodologies to student-centred, inquiry-based approaches presents significant challenges for educators. This scoping review examines reported professional learning approaches aimed at building teacher capacity in implementing inquiry-based mathematics instruction, with the potential to improve student engagement and interest in the subject. Here, capacity refers to a teacher’s ongoing professional ability to implement and effect change. The review provides insights into various hindrances to implementing inquiry-based learning, including the substantial time investment required, teachers’ confidence levels, and the challenge of shifting deeply ingrained pedagogical beliefs. Conversely, it identifies a range of supports for facilitating this pedagogical shift, with the ultimate goal of improving students’ mathematical outcomes. These supports include school-wide commitments to providing opportunities for teachers to actively collaborate with specialist educators and mentors within their institutions. Findings from this review underscore that the transition to inquiry-based approaches is a gradual process requiring sustained effort and commitment. The foundation for this shift lies in cultivating a school culture that acknowledges and addresses the complex needs of both teachers and leaders in implementing inquiry-based learning. This review contributes to the growing body of literature on professional development in mathematics education, offering valuable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers seeking to enhance mathematical instruction and student outcomes through inquiry-based approaches.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>We study an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating product-term regression models with missing data. The study of such problems in the frequentist tradition has thus far been restricted to an EM algorithm method using full numerical integration. However, under most missing data patterns, we show that this problem can be solved analytically, and numerical approximations are only needed under specific conditions. Thus we propose a hybrid EM algorithm, which uses analytic solutions when available and approximate solutions only when needed. The theoretical framework of our algorithm is described herein, along with three empirical experiments using both simulated and real data. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides greater estimation accuracy, exhibits robustness to distributional violations, and confers higher power to detect interaction effects. We conclude with a discussion of extensions and topics of further research.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Performance management in university-based scientific research institutions is essential for driving reform, advancing education quality, and fostering innovation. However, current performance evaluation models often focus solely on research indicators, neglecting the critical interdependence between the education and research systems. This oversight leads to inefficiencies in resource allocation and an underestimation of overall institutional performance, particularly in universities with varying development levels. To address these deficiencies, this study introduces two innovative two-stage data envelopment analysis models: the group-frontier and meta-frontier evaluation models. The findings are validated using data from 144 universities across China. They demonstrate that the proposed models effectively mitigate the underestimation of efficiency in traditional models and accurately reflect the intertwined nature of university subsystems and the disparities in university development. These results offer valuable insights for improving the performance of scientific research institutions and informing the strategic decisions of university administrators and government education departments.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>To shape professional learning (PL) and curriculum interventions for successfully transforming instruction, we need to better understand how multiple aspects of the system work. Applying structural equation modeling with a sample of 437 teachers in 153 middle and high schools in 11 districts serving 50% or more Black or Latinx students, we found that teachers are significantly more likely to use ambitious and culturally responsive (CR) instruction in the classroom and that student engagement increases when PL and curriculum adoption are (1) targeted toward ambitious and CR instruction, (2) provide clear, specific directions to teachers, (3) are aligned with each other, (4) are supported by teachers, and (5) are accompanied by incentives. PL worked through fostering stronger beliefs in and confidence using CR instruction. The curriculum and PL had both independent and interactive effects on bolstering the use of ambitious and CR instruction.

          Abstract
                  <p>Transitioning from material to theoretical geometry is often considered a significant challenge in compulsory education. Over the last twenty years, research rooted in the Theory of Didactical Situations (TDS) has explored how material geometry can support the teaching and learning of theoretical geometry, promoting continuity in teaching. These studies have defined didactically focused material geometry practices, referred to as “the geometry of tracing,” where figure reproduction is considered a fundamental situation within this geometric practice. In this text, we explore the potential of transposing this fundamental situation into a didactic one within a classroom setting. Based on the analysis of a case study, we examine the relationship between the effective situation and the learning process. We pay attention to the roles and interactions of adaptation and acculturation processes in the observed didactic phenomena. The TDS framework helps us analyze how the combination of the a-didactical potential of the situation and the teacher’s didactic interventions promotes a shift towards theoretical geometry.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Retention of teachers of color remains a persistent educational concern, yet little research explores whether teachers of color are less likely to turnover when teaching in schools with principals and peer teaching staff of the same race/ethnicity. This study explores whether principal and peer teacher demographics predict teacher turnover in New York City, and whether they do so differently for teachers of color. We find that Black teachers are less likely to turnover when working in schools with a principal and a higher share of peer teachers of the same race/ethnicity. Results show similar and more consistent patterns for White teachers but no significant difference for Hispanic teachers. We conclude by discussing implications for educational policy, practice, and research.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This study proposes a Bayesian method for diagnostic classification models (DCMs) for a partially known Q-matrix setting between exploratory and confirmatory DCMs. This Q-matrix setting is practical and useful because test experts have pre-knowledge of the Q-matrix but cannot readily specify it completely. The proposed method employs priors for the Bayesian variable selection to simultaneously estimate the effects of active and nonactive attributes, and the simulations lead to appropriate attribute recovery rates. Furthermore, the proposed method recovers the attribute mastery of individuals at the same as for a fully known Q-matrix. In addition, the proposed methods can be used to estimate the unknown Q-matrix part. A real data example indicates that the proposed Bayesian estimation method for the partially known Q-matrix fits better than a fully specified Q-matrix. Finally, extensions and future research directions are discussed.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study investigated how income inequality shapes the role of economic and cultural capital in students’ academic performance. By analyzing a multilevel dataset of 72 countries (economies), we found that (1) the associations between economic capital and academic achievements are stronger in unequal societies than in equal ones, whereas the associations between cultural capital and students’ achievements are stronger in equal societies than in unequal ones, and (2) in more equal societies, the associations between cultural capital and students’ achievements are stronger for students with lower economic capital, whereas the associations between cultural capital and students’ achievements are stronger for students with higher stocks of economic capital in unequal societies. The findings contribute to understanding how social context shapes the processes of intergenerational reproduction from a comparative perspective.
