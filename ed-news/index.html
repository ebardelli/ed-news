          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines interactions between educational systems and environments, focusing on the stance leaders take toward instructional guidance in their environment. After analyzing interview and focus group data from 49 school and system leaders across three systems (i.e., Montessori, International Baccalaureate, Catholic), we found differences by system in leaders’ stances toward their environment. These stances provided context for the educational infrastructure of each system and for the challenges leaders faced. Rather than taking it as a given that instructional practice is loosely coupled to educational policy, these findings help to illuminate a variety of relationships between systems, environments, and classroom practice, and suggest such variety has implications for school and system improvement.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The debate over race-conscious admissions has gained prominence, notably in cases such as Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard. In debates on race-conscious admissions, the question is often not whether a student will go to college, but which college the student will attend. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we examined racial and socioeconomic disparities in the probability of acceptance to a student’s first-choice college based on institutional selectivity. Race was a significant predictor of acceptance to a first-choice college, with Black and Asian students facing odds of acceptance that were 46% to 59% lower than those of White peers. However, at highly competitive or most selective colleges, race was no longer a significant predictor, and racial disparities in acceptance rates diminished. Socioeconomic status had no significant association with the probability of acceptance to a first-choice college.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper presents restorative action research - a relational, collective, vital approach to fostering wellbeing. It is based on cooperative inquiry carried out by six academics over three years, for the purpose of enhancing their own wellbeing in the increasingly precarious world of higher education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the concept of “vital assemblages” as an analytical tool, the paper illustrates how restorative action research enhanced the participants’ sense of feeling alive, active, and joyful at a time of great stress. This relational, collective, vital approach to wellbeing offers an alternative to the dominant individualistic, internal framing of wellbeing. It is relevant to organizations outside of academia, as echoed in the idea of “networked wellbeing” emerging from the Global South. Restorative action research is also a political act with transformational potential, because it creates social spaces that enable people to free themselves and resist, if only a little, the influence of organizations and other dominant fields that cause illbeing and threaten human society.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>In modern firms, conflicts may arise between the chief executive officer and board of directors due to the separation of ownership and operations. Such conflicts may weaken listed companies’ performance in the short term or affect their development in the long term. Using data on Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2013 to 2022, this study empirically examines the impact of internal control quality on boardroom backscratching. We find that internal control quality significantly mitigates boardroom backscratching by reducing agency costs and increasing analyst attention. This effect is more significant in firms where the management holds less power and the product market is highly competitive. Furthermore, the mitigating effects of internal control quality on boardroom backscratching effectively reduce the risk of the company’s share price collapsing. Overall, this study enriches the literature on boardroom backscratching and internal control quality, and provides valuable references for stakeholders, including listed companies, to improve firm governance efficiency and, thus, maintain the stability of capital markets.

          Abstract
                    <p>Recent research in university mathematics education has moved beyond the traditional focus on the transition from secondary to tertiary education and students' understanding of introductory courses such as pre-calculus and calculus. There is growing interest in the challenges students face as they move into more advanced mathematics courses that require a shift toward formal reasoning, proof, modeling, and problem-solving skills. This survey paper explores emerging trends and innovations in the field, focusing on three key areas: innovations in teaching and learning advanced mathematical topics, transitions between different levels and contexts of mathematics education, and the role of proof and proving in advanced university mathematics. The survey reflects the evolving landscape of mathematics education research and addresses the theoretical and practical challenges of teaching and learning advanced mathematics across various contexts.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>While natural language documents, such as intervention transcripts and participant writing samples, can provide highly nuanced insights into educational and psychological constructs, researchers often find these materials difficult and expensive to analyze. Recent developments in machine learning, however, have allowed social scientists to harness the power of artificial intelligence for complex data categorization tasks. One approach, supervised learning, supports high-performance categorization yet still requires a large, hand-labeled training corpus, which can be costly. An alternative approach—zero- and few-shot classification with pretrained large language models—offers a cheaper, compelling alternative. This article considers the application of zero-shot and few-shot classification in educational research. We provide an overview of large language models, a step-by-step tutorial on using the Python openai package for zero-shot and few-shot classification, and a discussion of relevant research considerations for social scientists.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher resilience literature has expanded rapidly with a large number of publications and an evolving knowledge base. To capture a synthetic account systematically and effectively, this review provides a bibliometric approach to quantitatively examine the metadata of 692 relevant publications during the 26 years from 1998 to 2023.The finding traces the field’s progression from an initial concern for at-risk children to early conceptual discussions of resilience and, ultimately, more in-depth theoretical, empirical, and experimental investigations of teacher resilience, particularly within specific contexts like language teaching. However, the future trajectory of this domain remains an open question.The bibliometric review also enabled the researchers to anchor future research directions and contemplate the key challenges, such as the need for more international collaborations, concerted efforts to study teacher resilience across varied contexts, and the need to carefully balance productivity and influence when conducting new studies. Overall, this review aims to spark thoughtful discussions among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers regarding teacher resilience, in order to establish a more sustainable and global knowledge base.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The importance of the school environment in the development and achievement of youth has been well-documented. Racial inequities within the school environment may lead to differential schooling experiences and perceptions between racially minoritized youth and their White peers. Differences in school racial climate contribute to the achievement gap and impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite this understanding, school racial climate literature remains underemphasized due, in part, to the absence of a unifying model of school racial climate. The current article discusses the importance of school racial climate as conceptually distinct from school climate, provides an overview of existing literature across fields, and identifies factors for consideration in advancing school racial climate research.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study, using a scriptwriting task, examines how 52 Czech pre-service mathematics teachers (PMTs) handled a situation in which a fictional pupil’s incorrect reasoning resulted in a correct answer. The participants were asked to imagine and provide a script that reflects how the situation could evolve in response to the pupil’s incorrect reasoning with a correct answer (IRCA). We found some PMTs allowed the teacher in the scripts to take an active role in directing pupils to realize the IRCA and refute it through counter-examples. After orienting pupils, the teacher moved pupils’ thinking forward by foregrounding new strategies towards a more preferred strategy. However, some PMTs allowed pupils in the scripts to take more responsibility in recommending alternative strategies in response to the IRCA and justify the strategies. PMTs suggested teacher involvement or intervention in creating counter-examples considerably more frequently than letting pupils in the scripts provide alternative strategies and justifications. The results of the study highlight the important role of PMTs in harmonizing teaching strategies in their scripts with the curricular necessities and cognitive developments of pupils.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The rise of interest in data science raises questions about what changes may be needed in how we address the teaching of statistics with primary children. In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Standard item response theory (IRT) models are ill-equipped for when the probability of a correct response depends on the location in the test where an item is encountered—a phenomenon we refer to as position effects. Unmodeled position effects complicate comparing respondents taking the same test. We propose a position-sensitive IRT model that is a mixture of two item response functions, capturing the difference in response probability when the item is encountered early versus late in the test. The mixing proportion depends on item location and latent person-level characteristics, separating person and item contributions to position effects. We present simulation studies outlining various features of model performance and end with an application to a large-scale admissions test with observed position effects.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research incorporating either eye-tracking technology or immersive technology (virtual reality and 360 video) into studying teachers’ professional noticing is recent. Yet, such technologies allow a better understanding of the embodied nature of professional noticing. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine how teachers’ eye-gaze in immersive representations of practice correspond to their attending to children’s mathematics. Using a mixed methods approach, we incorporated eye-tracking technology embedded within a virtual reality environment to compare novice and expert teachers’ gaze duration with quality of professional noticing. Findings and results both corroborate and extend previous research evidence about important differences in professional noticing between expert and novice teachers. Specifically, the amount of experience, and thus familiarity, teachers have with being in a classroom may affect their physical movement in both real and virtual representations of practice. Additionally, findings and results emphasize the importance of teachers’ visual focus on students’ doing of mathematics across the classroom.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Federal entitlement policies like Title III and the IDEA help grant multilingual learners (MLs) and students with disabilities (SWDs) access to public schools. Yet they have operated in ways that continue to “other” the very student populations they intend to integrate. Drawing on social network surveys and semi-structured interviews collected from one urban district over 18 months, we ask: To what degree do central office leaders share responsibility for instructional decision-making in literacy and math? And, how did organizational conditions disrupt or perpetuate the “othering” of MLs and SWDs among central office staff? Leveraging a conceptual framework of critical social network analysis and institutional theory, we found that, despite efforts to promote joint-work and shared responsibility across central office departments, regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive dimensions of the institutional environment continued to “other” special populations leaders from content-area leaders and, thus, the core of instructional decision-making.

Recent literature on racialized organizations have begun to address whiteness, but we have yet to fully understand how whiteness functions within organizations to reproduce racial inequities and sustain white supremacy as a racialized hegemonic power. Furthermore, there is little evidence on how organizations and their leaders support or resist whiteness. In this systematic review of whiteness in higher education research from the past 20 years, I identify a gap in the literature—that whiteness in higher education organizations is under examined. To begin to redress this gap, I designed a conceptual framework that examines how white supremacy as a hegemonic and racialized power via whiteness functions and is potentially contested in higher education organizations.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>PK–12 district-level administrators have been asked to navigate an increasingly complex policy landscape concerning gender-diversity reforms. We apply sensemaking theory to examine administrators’ understanding of legal and policy protections for trans and gender diverse (TGD) students. Using 36 interviews with administrators and policy consultants, we examine whether PK-12 district administrators (a) know about existing legal and policy protections, (b) tie policies to administrative actions, (c) build capacity for structural gender reforms, and (d) proactively learn about gender diversity. We use these categories to delineate among resistant, emergent, and gender-inclusive leadership approaches along the Gender-Inclusivity Leadership Spectrum. Our findings suggest PK–12 leaders would benefit from additional implementation strategies and education concerning gender diversity, even in states with protective legislative mandates for TGD people in schools.
