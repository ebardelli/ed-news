          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper presents successive phases of Taking Boys Seriously (TBS), a longitudinal participatory action research initiative bringing together diverse educational bodies and indigenous educators across a highly stratified education system in a contested society. The voices and everyday life and school experiences of adolescent boys are positioned firmly at the centre of a research methodology aimed at re-engaging, empowering, and learning from marginalised boys. We discuss how a collaborative and reflexive process co-produced with a committed steering group has been vital in pursuit of systemic change. New concepts of compounded educational disadvantage, relational education, and an educational ecosystem have been co-theorised and applied in practical ways to counter deficit narratives and support holistic approaches and new partnerships across educational settings in Northern Ireland. Strengths and limitations of our participatory approach are considered, particularly in relation to the role and participation of boys in the research process.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study focuses on ethical dilemmas that arise in moments of inclusion and equity in mathematics teaching and how they might be tackled through teachers’ professional judgment. Skovsmose’s inclusive landscapes of investigation approach was used to design the study and to collect teachers’ joint reflections on moments of inclusion and equity in their teaching. Ethical dilemmas and professional judgment were the analytical foci for a qualitative thematic content analysis. Three explorative workshops were held with two teams of teachers from two schools in Sweden. The analysis identified three themes of ethical dilemma, and ways in which these were responded to by teachers’ professional judgment: (1) dilemmas of diversity and acting justly; (2) dilemmas of resources and allocating them fairly; (3) dilemmas of values and recognising diversity. We conclude that mathematics teachers’ professional judgments involve showing bravery, going outside of the norm, negotiating values and duties, listening to the students, and throughout this, engaging in collegial learning in the best interests of the learner.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper describes how the notion of the strongly didactic contract can serve to characterize the teaching adopted to implement a task in probability. It is particularly focused on the reality of mathematical work performed by students and teachers. For this research, classroom sessions were developed in an in-service teacher training course designed (and adapted) according to the Japanese Lesson Study model. Through the combined use of the Theory of Didactical Situations (TDS) and the Theory of Mathematical Working Spaces (ThMWS), a coding of the sessions observed was developed. Based on this coding, different patterns emerged which gave each session a specific rhythm and identity from which it was possible to recognize and characterize different strongly didactic contracts. The study highlights the difference between the potential contracts intended by the teachers and those observed in practice. The tools, and especially the coding, developed for the study could be used for future research on instructional situations or in-service teacher training.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Nationally, teachers have experienced major changes in how their performance is evaluated. Teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system likely influences whether they will use the evaluation data to make instructional improvements, yet we know little about teachers’ perceptions of their evaluations. Using survey data from Chicago Public Schools, we explore teacher satisfaction with the evaluation system and their perceptions of its fairness and accuracy. Sixty percent of teachers reported being satisfied with the district’s reformed teacher evaluation. However, satisfaction declined following the implementation of the district’s more rigorous evaluation system, driven by tenured teachers’ differentially negative impressions. Notably, teacher satisfaction was higher in schools with strong climates, particularly where teachers perceived instructional leadership as effective. These findings underscore the importance of school leaders in the implementation of teacher evaluation policies and suggest that some principals need support fostering school climates focused on instructional improvement and building strong relationships with staff.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Collaborative relationships between families and teachers of elementary-aged children are complicated by teachers’ lack of training for family engagement and by hierarchical and racialized power differentials. Home visiting can create a space for teachers to center and honor families’ ways of knowing and being, but those home visits need to be conducted in ways specifically intended to build relationships with families; otherwise, the visits can do damage. In this descriptive exploratory study, we examined how teachers responded to families’ openings during home visits. We articulate a theory that describes actions teachers can employ to build rapport, particularly across difference. This work has implications for research on family engagement and for teacher preparation for home visiting.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study leverages national data and a quasi-experimental design to examine the influence of enrolling in an exclusively online degree program on students’ likelihood of completing their degree. We find that enrolling in an exclusively online degree program had a negative influence on students’ likelihood of completing their bachelor's degree or any degree when compared to their otherwise-similar peers who enrolled in at least some face-to-face courses. The negative relationship between exclusively online enrollment and students’ likelihood of bachelor's degree completion was relatively consistent among White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, low-income, and military students. Findings focused solely on those students enrolled in exclusively online degree programs revealed that the negative influence of exclusively online enrollment was exacerbated when the student attended a for-profit 4-year institution.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows high-poverty schools to offer free meals to all students regardless of household income. Conceptualizing universal meal provision as a strategy to alleviate stigma associated with school meals, we hypothesize that CEP implementation reduces the incidence of suspensions, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds and minoritized students. We link educational records for students enrolled in Oregon public schools between 2010 and 2017 with administrative data describing their families’ household income and social safety net program participation. Difference-in-differences analyses indicate that CEP has protective effects on the probability of suspension for students in participating schools, particularly for students from low-income families, students who received free or reduced-price meals prior to CEP implementation, and Hispanic students.
