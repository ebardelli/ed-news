          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Project-based learning (PBL) grounds instruction in authentic learning experiences where students engage in real-world explorations that culminate in a final product or performance. We report on a mixed methods study with 43 ninth-grade English language arts (ELA) teachers (22 PBL and 21 comparison) and 1,671 students exploring the feasibility of enacting PBL in ELA classrooms and examining how teachers and students perceived this approach to learning. PBL teachers enacted PBL design principles significantly more than comparison teachers. The majority of PBL teachers perceived positive instructional shifts including more student-centered and authentic learning, more student choice, and greater student engagement. Many teachers also expressed a sense of renewal and passion. Students in PBL classrooms reported more meaningful learning experiences, opportunities for collaboration, and other aspects of social and emotional learning. We discuss tensions, including the challenge of covering required content and skills within a PBL-focused classroom.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Research on the big-fish-little-pond effect demonstrates that class-average achievement negatively affects students’ academic self-concept via social comparison processes. The neighborhood-effects literature reports positive effects of advantageous socioeconomic neighborhood conditions on students’ academic development via collective socialization mechanisms. To investigate how socioeconomic neighborhood conditions affect academic self-concept, we separately and simultaneously analyzed classroom- and neighborhood-level composition effects on students’ academic self-concept, using two samples drawn from two grade levels ([math] = 3,906, [math] = 3,277). Analyses of the neighborhood level only indicate that socioeconomic neighborhood conditions negatively predict general, math, and German self-concept in Grade 5. In Grade 9, this holds only for math self-concept. In simultaneous analyses including classrooms and neighborhoods, socioeconomically advantageous neighborhood conditions negatively predicted general and math self-concept in Grade 5.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Some high school seniors who plan to attend college in the fall following graduation do not enroll. This phenomenon, known as summer melt, contributes to lower educational attainment, particularly among low-income students. We extend the literature on summer melt in two ways. First, we show that melt estimates can be sensitive to measurement decisions and local context, and in particular that estimates based on student-level National Student Clearinghouse data can overstate the extent of summer melt. Second, we show that aspects of students’ behavior and perceptions, such as their attendance rates, Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) completion, and confidence about their intended college, predict summer melt. These results suggest ways that school staff and summer melt interventions could potentially target additional support to college-intending students to facilitate their successful transition to college.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher professional development (PD) is among the most prominent levers used to improve teaching quality. The findings of research studies examining PD interventions are heterogeneous, with meta-analyses indicating mean positive impacts but also the existence of many ineffective programs. Educational Researcher has served as a critical platform for conversations on strengthening the research base on teacher PD. In this article, we argue that insights from behavioral economics have the potential to improve professional development research by pointing toward solutions that can strengthen the implementation of well-designed PD. We provide illustrative examples of how concepts from behavioral economics can inform our understanding of barriers to effective PD implementation and discuss behavioral-economics-based tools to mitigate these barriers. We conclude by discussing future applications and research directions.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This article presents a synthesized historiography of higher education in American prisons, exploring interactions of federal, state, and institution-level policies within six specific states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, and Texas. We define considerations for researchers, policymakers, and advocates regarding efforts to sustain educational access for incarcerated students. Findings suggest access is inextricably linked to policies relying on the social construction of crime and incarceration. As such, sole reliance on federal support may be detrimental for programs. A focus on diversifying funding sources will likely better ensure the long-term durability of support for higher education in prison programming.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 25. September 2024</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Scholars theorize that “opportunity gaps” drive achievement disparities between children born into poverty versus affluence. In a 26-year longitudinal study (N = 814), we examine (a) economic disparity in children’s accumulation of opportunities—from birth through high school—at home, childcare, school, afterschool, and in the neighborhood; (b) the extent to which opportunity is linked with educational attainment and earnings in early adulthood; and (c) whether opportunity is most strongly associated with these adult outcomes for children from low-income households. We document large opportunity gaps between children from low- versus higher-income households. These opportunity gaps are strongly linked with educational attainment and earnings, particularly for low-income children, helping explain why household income in early childhood predicts these outcomes in adulthood.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Pandemic-era disruptions to schooling resulted in academic setbacks for many students. To help students catch up, school districts nationwide are implementing a range of academic recovery interventions. In this paper, we use multiple data sources to evaluate the impact and implementation of academic recovery interventions in four school districts during the 2021-2022 school year. Our estimates suggest the interventions failed to reach the expected number of students and had little detectable impact on students’ test scores. Interviews with district officials highlight a host of challenges districts faced during the 2021-2022 school year. Considering the overall scale of pandemic learning loss, our results raise urgent questions about the adequacy of academic recovery efforts relative to students’ needs. The results also have implications for how districts might respond to disrupted learning in the future (e.g. in the wake of natural disasters).

          Abstract
                  <p>This study examines the relationship between instructional quality and mathematics achievement, taking into account socioeconomic status. Data from ten European countries participating in PISA 2012 and 2022 were analysed using the framework of the Dynamic Modelling of Educational Effectiveness. In PISA 2012, instructional quality was defined by student-oriented instruction, classroom management, teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation. The finding indicated that teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation positively predict student achievement, but dimensions of student-oriented instruction and classroom management were negatively related in several countries. Instructional quality was captured by four dimensions in PISA 2022, namely, teacher support, disciplinary climate, cognitive activation in mathematics of encouraging mathematical thinking and of fostering reasoning. Teacher support and disciplinary climate had a positive effect on achievement, but two aspects of cognitive activation had opposite effects on achievement. SES also had significant indirect effects on achievement through various instructional quality dimensions. Across two PISA cycles, teacher support, disciplinary climate, and cognitive activation consistently benefited low-SES students, while classroom management and student-oriented instruction tended to harm their performance. These results underscore the role of instructional quality in promoting equity for disadvantaged students. Trend data from these two cycles of PISA, give an indication of specific instructional strategies that do consistently contribute to student achievement. Implications and findings are discussed in relation to the policy and practice context in different education systems.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study explored preservice mathematics teachers’ (PMTs’) use of proportional reasoning given a situation that involves relating degrees to radian angle measure. Five PMTs participated in a semi-structured task-based interview to solve conversion questions from degrees to radians. Thematic analysis of the transcripts showed PMTs using and connecting various proportional reasoning concepts to describe angle measure in radians when given the measure in degrees. The PMTs also justified using memorized facts and calculations for efficiency and practicality. Findings suggest that conversion questions elicit meanings that are attuned to proportional reasoning concepts. I conclude that PMTs’ meanings for the relationship between degrees and radians are complex and not limited to memorization. Mathematics teacher educators can support PMTs by building on proportional reasoning in situations involving conversion between degrees and radians to encourage them to move beyond memorized facts and calculations.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>We conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model—and its related variants—on science, math, and motivation outcomes. The 5E Instructional Model is a framework for delivering STEM instruction that is based on constructivist learning theory; it has been used throughout the U.S. and other countries, particularly in Turkey. Despite its wide usage, no comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of 5E and related models has yet been conducted. Our search and screening procedures yielded 61 randomized controlled trial studies, estimating 156 effect sizes; 70% of studies met WWC standards with or without reservations. We found that the 5E instructional model resulted in improved science outcomes (g = 0.82, 95% CI [0.67, 0.97]), but a large amount of heterogeneity requires some caution (t = 0.56). We explored numerous explanations for the effect heterogeneity and provided practical recommendations.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Heightened concerns about the health of the teaching profession highlight the importance of studying the early teacher pipeline. This exploratory, descriptive article examines preservice teachers’ expressed motivation for pursuing a teaching career. Using data from a large teacher education program in Texas, we use a natural language processing algorithm to categorize into topical groups roughly 2,800 essay responses to the prompt, “Explain why you decided to become a teacher.” We identify 10 topics that largely reflect altruistic and intrinsic (although not extrinsic) reasons for teaching. The frequency of topics varied substantially by preservice teacher gender, race/ethnicity, and certification area. Intrinsic enjoyment of teaching and experiences with adversity predicted higher clinical teaching performance and lower attrition as a full-time teacher.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Texas legislation mandated that colleges offer developmental education using a corequisite model, where students concurrently enroll in introductory college-level courses with supplemental developmental support. Using data from the population of Texas students in developmental education, we estimated regression models to investigate differential relationships between corequisite characteristics and outcomes, both overall and by student characteristics. Our findings suggest there is no single “magic bullet” course structure that is universally more effective, as relationships between the reform and student success vary by subject and student subgroup. Additionally, even a single credit of corequisite developmental support can be beneficial for some students, potentially more so than traditional three-credit courses.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent efforts prohibiting race-related diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have informed localized public pushback narrating anti-equity campaigns. Emerging research and media accounts have largely focused on adults engaged with or against these efforts, with less attention on youth and their perceptions of these campaigns. To center youth voice, we analyzed 224 student newspaper articles published in Carmel, Indiana and Loudoun County, Virginia—two sites replete with localized contestations of equity reform. Using narrative policy analysis and approaches to counter-narratives, findings demonstrate youths’ roles as engaged policy actors as student journalists highlighted forms of political engagement and action in their local contexts. We include recommendations for school leaders and policymakers to promote youth voice and engagement in education governance.

          Abstract
                  <p>Understanding the concept of completeness for an ordered field is known to be difficult for many university mathematics students. We hypothesise that the variety of possible axioms of completeness for the set of real numbers is one of the sources of difficulties as is the lack of understanding of the raison d’être of these axioms. In this paper, we address this issue by first recalling the discussions on the first proof of the intermediate value theorem by Cauchy (Cours ď analyse De L'École Royale Polytechnique, Part 1: Analyse Algébrique. Debure Frères, 1821) as a contribution to the understanding of the role of completeness in real analysis. Then, we discuss a few research papers that involve the intermediate value theorem and put them in perspective with our own approach. In the second part of the paper, we briefly recall Bolzano’s dissection method and then analyse four proofs of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem for both the set and the sequence versions of the theorem. We then draw on this study to present and motivate the main features of a forthcoming multi-proofs activity that aims to expose students to a small number of axioms of the completeness property and the use of these axioms in proof and proving.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The research presented in this paper aims to shed light on the complex role of mathematics teacher educators who led courses for prospective mathematics teachers. Theoretically, the research combines the documentational approach to didactics and the meta-didactical transposition frameworks, complementing the study with the analysis of the teacher educators’ beliefs about the prospective teachers’ needs. The methodology entails a comparative case study related to two courses, taking place in quite different contexts, led by the two authors independently, and a collaborative self-study of teacher education approach, based on eight reciprocal semi-structured interviews between the authors. The result is a holistic model of mathematics teacher educators’ work that takes into account their practices, including the design of teaching materials based on a variety of resources, justifying discourses and personal beliefs. This can deepen our insight into the expertise of mathematics teacher educators and, prospectively, can be fruitful for their professional development.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Teachers are critical to student learning, but adequately staffing classrooms has been challenging in many parts of the country. Though teacher shortages are widely reported, they are poorly understood, particularly in terms of the magnitude and variation of the shortages, and reported figures are often localized and anecdotal. To address this gap, we systematically examine news reports, Department of Education data, and publicly available information on teacher shortages for every U.S. state. We characterize the data landscape and find there are at least 39,700 vacant positions along with at least 288,000 positions being held by underqualified teachers, both of which are conservative estimates of the extent of teacher shortages nationally. We discuss the implications of our findings for improving data systems, including more specific and consistent reporting of shortage, as well as implications for teacher preparation and education policy.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>We describe alignment between high school career and technical education (CTE) and local labor markets across five states—Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Tennessee, and Washington. We find that CTE is partially aligned with local labor markets. A 10-percentage-point higher share of local jobs related to a CTE career cluster is associated with a 3-point higher rate of CTE concentration in that cluster. Women and students from racial or ethnic minority groups are better aligned with local employment than men, in part due to their selection of CTE fields like Education &amp; Training, Health Science, and Hospitality &amp; Tourism, which correspond with a large portion of the workforce in almost every metro area. We find more limited evidence of dynamic, short-term adjustments in CTE after changes in local labor markets. A small degree of realignment lags the labor market by 2 to 3 years and is only observed following changes in college-level employment.

      </h3>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Many states and communities have invested in public early childhood education programs to improve children’s readiness to enter school and narrow achievement gaps in later grades. This study asked whether and how Wisconsin’s universal state-funded prekindergarten program, Wisconsin 4K, has improved student achievement and helped to reduce the achievement gap. Using publicly available data from 2002–2003 to 2013–2014, the study examined the effects of the program, which features high participation rates and part-day delivery modes. The results showed that Wisconsin 4K enhanced third-grade reading achievement but not math achievement in the participating districts. Its effects were larger for non-White and economically disadvantaged students than for their White and affluent counterparts. The policy implications for large-scale universal pre-K are discussed.
