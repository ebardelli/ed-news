          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Machine learning (ML) methods for causal inference have gained popularity due to their flexibility to predict the outcome model and the propensity score. In this article, we provide a within-group approach for ML-based causal inference methods in order to robustly estimate average treatment effects in multilevel studies when there is cluster-level unmeasured confounding. We focus on one particular ML-based causal inference method based on the targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with an ensemble learner called SuperLearner. Through our simulation studies, we observe that training TMLE within groups of similar clusters helps remove bias from cluster-level unmeasured confounders. Also, using within-group propensity scores estimated from fixed effects logistic regression increases the robustness of the proposed within-group TMLE method. Even if the propensity scores are partially misspecified, the within-group TMLE still produces robust ATE estimates due to double robustness with flexible modeling, unlike parametric-based inverse propensity weighting methods. We demonstrate our proposed methods and conduct sensitivity analyses against the number of groups and individual-level unmeasured confounding to evaluate the effect of taking an eighth-grade algebra course on math achievement in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Increasing school-based parental involvement—which has links to improved student outcomes like academic achievement—is a core area of focus in many preschool programs. Yet, little research to date has examined what the association is between attending preschool and school-based parental involvement in early elementary school. This study addresses this gap by drawing on nationally-representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 2010 to 2011 (N = 18,174) to examine the association between preschool attendance and measures of school-based parental involvement in early elementary school. The findings reveal consistent positive associations between preschool attendance and school-based parental involvement. There is little evidence of variation in associations based on the type (e.g., private and Head Start) or location (e.g., center-based and school-based) of the preschool program.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To expand the use of cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) to longitudinal assessments, this study proposes a bias-corrected three-step estimation approach for latent transition CDMs with covariates by integrating a general CDM and a latent transition model. The proposed method can be used to assess changes in attribute mastery status and attribute profiles and to evaluate the covariate effects on both the initial state and transition probabilities over time using latent (multinomial) logistic regression. Because stepwise approaches generally yield biased estimates, correction for classification error probabilities is considered in this study. The results of the simulation study showed that the proposed method yielded more accurate parameter estimates than the uncorrected approach. The use of the proposed method is also illustrated using a set of real data.

          Abstract
                  <p>Language is a source of power that preserves the status quo in its relationships with learners and mathematics. However, there is a dearth of research that examines how multiple systems of power (e.g., racism, cisheteropatriarchy, colonialism) shape variation in structural inequality and experiences of oppression for language learners. This conceptual paper argues that intersectionality is a promising analytical lens to advance interdisciplinary research on language in mathematics education that nuances knowledge about linguistic justice for racially minoritized and Indigenous learners. To develop this argument, we present insights from a scoping review of research in language education and mathematics education. Our review shows how intersectional analyses can interrogate inequities of language in mathematics education contexts, which are entrenched in ideologies of neutrality that leave exclusionary practices of teaching and learning unchecked. The review also depicts how uptake of intersectionality extends sociopolitical research on language in mathematics education that left interplay between racism, colonialism, linguicism, and other power systems unexamined for nuanced insights on linguistic justice. Following the review, we look across three cases of research studies from our review that vary in terms of their designs and methodologies to illustrate the analytical possibilities of intersectionality in future research on language in mathematics education. We conclude with a discussion of how adopting the lens of intersectionality is necessary to advance interdisciplinary scholarship for linguistic justice.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Using school-month-level learning mode data and high school completion rates across three school years from 429 Wisconsin public high schools, this study examines the impact of disruptions to in-person instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic on high school completion rates, with a focus on socioeconomic disparities. Findings reveal that a longer time in virtual or hybrid learning mode in 2020–21 decreases overall school completion rates and increases the within-school gap in completion rates between economically disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students. This study provides further evidence of the unequal impact of the pandemic and calls for initiatives to support disadvantaged students during school disruptions.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The global economies and international organizations are inclined towards sustainable growth, technological advancements and product innovations. China is the leading economy in information and communication technologies and among the major industrially expanded economies covering a substantial share of the global market in exports. The prime objective of this study is to explore the role of digitalization and Information and communication technologies (ICT) for product innovation (PIN). In doing so, the study also attempts to draw some novel implications regarding business, entrepreneurship, and product innovation in the lens of sustainability. This current study use the annual data of China from 1990–2020. The empirical analysis was conducted using the stationarity testing and the Johansen cointegration test. In addition, due to the data’s asymmetrical distribution, the non-parametric “quantile regression” is used. For robustness, this study employs the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square, Canonical Cointegration, and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square methods. The empirical results reveal that economic progress and financial development are substantial factors of product innovation. The robust analysis reveals that medium and high-tech industries and information and communication technology adversely affect product innovation. Further, the presence of financial development transforms the negative influence of information and communication technology into a positive. The current study concludes more investments in the technological industry are required to encourage product innovation in China. The study discusses some policy-related implications in the context of business sustainability and product innovation.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>At least 38 states have created service areas or “districts” for each of their community colleges. However, little is known about the geographic boundaries of community college districts and the policymaking process that defines them. We studied state policy documents nationally and the actual district boundaries of Texas community colleges to investigate the larger policymaking processes of determining boundaries. We found significant variation across the United States, including in who determines the boundaries and whether the districts have associated tuition reductions. In our case study, we also found evidence that the majority of Texas’s community college districts appear to reflect their larger local environments, although a small number may exhibit evidence of racial imbalance.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Supporting youths’ STEM dispositions takes an entire community of adults, yet we must understand the dispositions that adults bring to such community efforts, ways they influence youths’ learning and are shaped by the community. In this paper, we examine a sociotechnical system called Science Everywhere, which invited the broader community to interact with science learning experiences youths shared across home, school, and community settings. Integrating frameworks for disposition and asset-based community development, we present a case study of four focal adults within Science Everywhere embedded in one neighborhood. We make the case for a relational perspective of disposition development that leverages community members’ science and relational assets to foster dynamic, community-specific learning opportunities for youths, particularly those from resource-constrained communities.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examines the extent to which students obtain postsecondary credentials in the career technical education (CTE) fields of focus they choose in high school. Using school fixed-effects models, we find that focusing on a particular CTE field in high school is associated with an increased probability of enrolling and obtaining a postsecondary credential in that field. The secondary–postsecondary relationship varies across focus areas, and it is strongest in health (increase of 12.5 percentage points), which is disproportionately chosen by females. Across all fields of focus, however, most students enroll and obtain a postsecondary credential in fields that are different from what they focused on in high school.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Community teachers, particularly those who are Black and Latinx, are assumed to improve retention and outcomes depending on retention in schools that serve low-income Black and Latinx students. Based on a critical quantitative analysis of data collected on the career trajectories and retention of hundreds of alternatively certified mathematics teachers, the study shows that community insiders exhibit significantly higher rates of retention in district schools than community outsiders and, in particular, those from elite colleges. Utilizing quantitative critical theory methodology, the study helps to move the field beyond race-neutral analyses of teachers’ retention and careers.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Summer learning loss is a perennial concern for educators and parents alike. However, researchers have recently questioned whether summer learning loss is just a statistical artifact driven by how achievement is measured across the school year. In this study, we empirically investigated a plausible critique of summer learning loss research, namely that students do not put forth their best effort on the fall test compared with the spring test. While we cannot conclude based on our findings that students do in fact lose ground during the summer, we did not find evidence that seasonal differences in test effort are a main driver of summer learning patterns estimated with MAP Growth assessments.

          Abstract
                  <p>Previous research on bilingual mathematics education has proposed that as children “language mathematics” they use multiple sources of meaning. In this paper, we focus on lexical inventions—bilingual children’s made up words that are not formally defined or used but follow the phonology and morphology of a language—as a source of meaning. Consistent with tenets from translanguaging, we recognize lexical inventions as a creative language practice defying idealized language norms. A raciolinguistic theoretical perspective informs our interpretation of children, teachers, and researchers as listening subjects. The purpose of this paper is to explore how mathematical lexical inventions can prompt a translanguaging space where children, teachers, and researchers resist listening subject positions that predispose them to listen for predetermined language practices. Drawing on two lesson transcripts, one from a fourth-grade English-immersion classroom in Colombia and one from a third-grade Spanish-immersion classroom in the United States, we used moment analysis in translanguaging spaces to identify spontaneous and critical moments where lexical inventions prompted mathematical explorations. We argue for adopting listening subject positions as learners of transgressive language practices that are part of interactions between children and mathematics.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>The current study investigated the effectiveness of three distinct educational technologies—two game-based applications (From Here to There and DragonBox 12+) and two modes of online problem sets in ASSISTments (an Immediate Feedback condition and an Active Control condition with no immediate feedback) on Grade 7 students’ algebraic knowledge. More than 3,600 Grade 7 students across nine in-person and one virtual schools within the same district were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions. Students received nine 30-minute intervention sessions from September 2020 to March 2021. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses of the final analytic sample (N = 1,850) showed significantly higher posttest scores for students who used From Here to There and DragonBox 12+ compared to the Active Control condition. No significant difference was found for the Immediate Feedback condition. The findings have implications for understanding how game-based applications can affect algebraic understanding, even within pandemic pressures on learning.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In the Janus v. AFCSME (2018) decision, the U.S. Supreme Court mandated that all public sector workers, including teachers, operate in a Right to Work (RTW) framework. In the years since, teachers’ unions have not experienced the mass exodus that some predicted, but should we expect them to? Using an original, historical data set spanning 1942–2017, I examine the effect of prior RTW policies on teachers’ union membership and school expenditures. I find that RTW policies decrease teachers’ union membership by roughly 43% and reduce educational expenditures by nearly $800 per pupil. Importantly, effects take roughly 10 years to clearly materialize. Additional analyses provide support for the notion that effects on school resources are driven, in part, by effects on union membership.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) is a cutting-edge technology in educational measurement that targets at providing feedback on examinees’ strengths and weaknesses while increasing test accuracy and efficiency. To date, most CD-CAT studies have made methodological progress under simulated conditions, but little has applied CD-CAT to real educational assessment. The present study developed a Chinese reading comprehension item bank tapping into six validated reading attributes, with 195 items calibrated using data of 28,485 second to sixth graders and the item-level cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs). The measurement precision and efficiency of the reading CD-CAT system were compared and optimized in terms of crucial CD-CAT settings, including the CDMs for calibration, item selection methods, and termination rules. The study identified seven dominant reading attribute mastery profiles that stably exist across grades. These major clusters of readers and their variety with grade indicated some sort of reading developmental mechanisms that advance and deepen step by step at the primary school level. Results also suggested that compared to traditional linear tests, CD-CAT significantly improved the classification accuracy without imposing much testing burden. These findings may elucidate the multifaceted nature and possible learning paths of reading and raise the question of whether CD-CAT is applicable to other educational domains where there is a need to provide formative and fine-grained feedback but where there is a limited amount of test time.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Any time examinees have had access to items and/or answers prior to taking a test, the fairness of the test and validity of test score interpretations are threatened. Therefore, there is a high demand for procedures to detect both compromised items (CI) and examinees with preknowledge (EWP). In this article, we develop a procedure that uses item scores and distractors to simultaneously detect CI and EWP. The false positive rate and true positive rate are evaluated for both items and examinees using detailed simulations. A real data example is also provided using data from an information technology certification exam.

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers (PTs) should provide them with opportunities to deepen their understanding of and develop productive dispositions toward mathematics. Supporting mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) to learn how to develop practices that create rich learning opportunities for novice teachers comprises a challenge for our field. This analysis examines an unconventional professional learning experience for MTEs: viewing video of experienced teacher educators enacting the same lessons that they would enact with their own PTs. We examined how viewing videos embedded in a larger set of supports developed by the Elementary Mathematics Project (EMP) impacted MTEs’ actions when planning or enacting the lessons. EMP also includes high-quality curriculum materials to use with PTs and instructional guides to support their enactment. Twelve MTEs were interviewed about their experience viewing video clips to help them to engage in preparation (Mason, 2011) as they prepared to enact EMP lessons. MTEs’ noticings included how prospective teachers engage with the mathematics and one another and how the expert MTEs supported prospective teacher interactions and aspects of the classroom environment. MTEs connected the actions they identified to broader principles of teaching, offering a rationale for each and hypothesizing how it impacted the instruction. Importantly, through watching video, MTEs generated conceptual resources (e.g., identifying questions asked in the video that they wanted to try out), which they reported allowed them to respond to prospective teachers in the moment when teaching. Implications for using video to support MTE development are discussed.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>We propose the ‘flow of a proof’ as a construct that relates to the balance lecturers achieve in their presentation between the proof as a whole and its different parts, taking into account various aspects (informal, contextual) of proof classroom presentation. We conducted expert interviews in which we presented two different proofs of the same theorem to five experienced tertiary level mathematics lecturers and asked them to reflect on features of these proofs and of proofs in general, and on their considerations and practices when teaching proofs. The lecturers related to a rich collection of proof features and pedagogical considerations. Our findings demonstrate the subjectivity of lecturers’ considerations as well as tensions they experience between striving towards mathematical accuracy and adjusting the proof presentation to their students; these tensions influence the flow of the proof, which is an outcome of the choices that the lecturers make. We discuss our findings in light of existing literature about mathematicians’ pedagogical considerations and the existence of a shared pedagogical culture.</p>
