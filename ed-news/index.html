          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Cognitive diagnostic computerized adaptive testing (CD-CAT) is a cutting-edge technology in educational measurement that targets at providing feedback on examinees’ strengths and weaknesses while increasing test accuracy and efficiency. To date, most CD-CAT studies have made methodological progress under simulated conditions, but little has applied CD-CAT to real educational assessment. The present study developed a Chinese reading comprehension item bank tapping into six validated reading attributes, with 195 items calibrated using data of 28,485 second to sixth graders and the item-level cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs). The measurement precision and efficiency of the reading CD-CAT system were compared and optimized in terms of crucial CD-CAT settings, including the CDMs for calibration, item selection methods, and termination rules. The study identified seven dominant reading attribute mastery profiles that stably exist across grades. These major clusters of readers and their variety with grade indicated some sort of reading developmental mechanisms that advance and deepen step by step at the primary school level. Results also suggested that compared to traditional linear tests, CD-CAT significantly improved the classification accuracy without imposing much testing burden. These findings may elucidate the multifaceted nature and possible learning paths of reading and raise the question of whether CD-CAT is applicable to other educational domains where there is a need to provide formative and fine-grained feedback but where there is a limited amount of test time.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Any time examinees have had access to items and/or answers prior to taking a test, the fairness of the test and validity of test score interpretations are threatened. Therefore, there is a high demand for procedures to detect both compromised items (CI) and examinees with preknowledge (EWP). In this article, we develop a procedure that uses item scores and distractors to simultaneously detect CI and EWP. The false positive rate and true positive rate are evaluated for both items and examinees using detailed simulations. A real data example is also provided using data from an information technology certification exam.

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers (PTs) should provide them with opportunities to deepen their understanding of and develop productive dispositions toward mathematics. Supporting mathematics teacher educators (MTEs) to learn how to develop practices that create rich learning opportunities for novice teachers comprises a challenge for our field. This analysis examines an unconventional professional learning experience for MTEs: viewing video of experienced teacher educators enacting the same lessons that they would enact with their own PTs. We examined how viewing videos embedded in a larger set of supports developed by the Elementary Mathematics Project (EMP) impacted MTEs’ actions when planning or enacting the lessons. EMP also includes high-quality curriculum materials to use with PTs and instructional guides to support their enactment. Twelve MTEs were interviewed about their experience viewing video clips to help them to engage in preparation (Mason, 2011) as they prepared to enact EMP lessons. MTEs’ noticings included how prospective teachers engage with the mathematics and one another and how the expert MTEs supported prospective teacher interactions and aspects of the classroom environment. MTEs connected the actions they identified to broader principles of teaching, offering a rationale for each and hypothesizing how it impacted the instruction. Importantly, through watching video, MTEs generated conceptual resources (e.g., identifying questions asked in the video that they wanted to try out), which they reported allowed them to respond to prospective teachers in the moment when teaching. Implications for using video to support MTE development are discussed.</p>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Wednesday, 19. April 2023</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Modern policies are commonly evaluated not with randomized experiments but with repeated measures designs like difference-in-differences (DID) and the comparative interrupted time series (CITS). The key benefit of these designs is that they control for unobserved confounders that are fixed over time. However, DID and CITS designs only result in unbiased impact estimates when the model assumptions are consistent with the data at hand. In this paper, we empirically test whether the assumptions of repeated measures designs are met in field settings. Using a within-study comparison design, we compare experimental estimates of the impact of patient-directed care on medical expenditures to non-experimental DID and CITS estimates for the same target population and outcome. Our data come from a multi-site experiment that includes participants receiving Medicaid in Arkansas, Florida, and New Jersey. We present summary measures of repeated measures bias across three states, four comparison groups, two model specifications, and two outcomes. We find that, on average, bias resulting from repeated measures designs are very close to zero (less than 0.01 standard deviations; SDs). Further, we find that comparison groups which have pre-treatment trends that are visibly parallel to the treatment group result in less bias than those with visibly divergent trends. However, CITS models that control for baseline trends produced slightly more bias and were less precise than DID models that only control for baseline means. Overall, we offer optimistic evidence in favor of repeated measures designs when randomization is not feasible.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Wednesday, 19. April 2023</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Increasing industrial activities trigger the intense use of fossil fuels and increase the number of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. Countries with a high share in current carbon emissions need to expand their use of renewable energy sources. Canada is an important energy producer and consumer globally. In this regard, its decisions are important for the future development of global emissions. This study examines the asymmetric effects of economic growth, renewable energy, and non-renewable energy consumption on carbon emissions in Canada from 1965 to 2017. In the first stage of the analysis, unit root testing was performed for the variables. For this, Lee-Strazicich (2003), ADF and PP unit root tests were used. The nonlinear ARDL method was used to analyze the relationship between variables. and Measures: In order to analyze the relationship between the variables in the established model, renewable energy consumption (%), non-renewable energy consumption (%), and carbon emissions (per capita-Mt). In addition, the economic growth (constant price 2010- US$) parameter was added to the model as a control variable. The findings support that energy consumption, economic growth, and renewable energy have an asymmetric effect on carbon emissions in the long run. The positive shock in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions, and a unit increase in renewable energy reduces carbon emissions by 1.29%. Besides, the negative shock in economic growth greatly deteriorates the quality of the environment; that is, a 1% reduction in economic growth causes emissions to increase by 0.74% in the long run. On the other hand, positive shocks in energy consumption have a positive and significant effect on carbon emissions. A 1% increase in energy consumption causes 1.69% carbon emissions. There are important policy implications for Canada to eliminate carbon emissions, increase the share of renewable energy sources and achieve its economic growth targets. In addition, Canada needs to reduce its consumption of non-renewable energy (such as gasoline coal, diesel, and natural gas).

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study examined the prevalence of student-to-student and staff-to-student sexual harassment in K-12 schools and school district compliance with Title IX using a retrospective survey of young adults. Participants (n = 511) were asked to describe their knowledge of policies and procedures regarding Title IX, the prevalence of sexual harassment, and the school’s observed response to harassment using a 34-item, anonymous online survey. Descriptive statistics revealed that 13.4% of participants perceived that sexual harassment at their K-12 school district was at a “moderate” or “high” level, 50.1% reported that they either knew someone who experienced sexual harassment by a school employee or experienced it themselves, and 17.4% (n = 89) of individuals personally experienced one or more incident of staff-to-student sexual harassment. Nearly all (94%) students were unable to identify their Title IX compliance officer and 70% were unaware of how to file grievances. School districts without policies and materials that address sexual harassment had statistically significantly higher rates of harassment than school districts with policies (p = .01) and materials (p &lt; .01).

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In response to COVID-19 many companies, particularly technology companies, voluntarily attended to the strained education sector by donating or temporarily discounting their core products, generating public support and gratitude. This type of philanthropic corporate action demonstrates an expansive and perhaps increasing function in the provisioning of certain educational materials and resources by private actors. This article analyzes this strand of corporate activity as pipeline philanthropy and shows how this model of strategic corporate giving differs from existing models of philanthropy in education. Through illustrations this study assesses the democratic implications of corporate entanglement through philanthropic action to evaluate whether the benefits brought about by an enhanced role for corporate actors in education are worth what they compromise.

          Abstract 
                  <p>Definitions play an important role in mathematics by stipulating objects of interest to mathematicians in order to facilitate theory building. Nevertheless, limited research has examined how mathematicians approach writing definitions or the values of the mathematical community that are upheld through norms related to definition use and writing. Based on interviews with nine algebraists/category theorists, we characterize two mathematical values upheld through definitions: clarity in and for communication and freedom of choice in the use and writing of definitions. Further results highlight the norms and values related to defining that participants do and do not claim to discuss through their instruction, including a clear emphasis on precision and rigor in mathematics but limited attempts to show that definitions are created by people to serve their needs. Implications include a need for providing instructional opportunities for students to engage with more mathematical values in order to better understand what algebraists do.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>This paper examines changes from 1996–2019 in U.S. parents’ time investment at their children’s schools using data from the National Household Education Survey (N ≈ 116,000). The most common way parents spend time at their child’s school is by attending a general school meeting, which rose from 76% to 85% over this period. The proportion who volunteered at school rose slightly over time (36% to 38%), whereas the frequency of participating in school activities decreased slightly. Little change emerged in the proportion who attend a PTA/PTO meeting (~50%), whereas the proportion who spent time fundraising decreased (60% to 54%). Differences in time investment between high- versus low-income parents either narrowed significantly (attended school meetings, frequency of participation) or remained stable (attended PTO/PTA meeting, volunteered) over time, except for income-based differences in time spent fundraising for their child’s school, which grew significantly. We discuss factors possibly related to these narrowing and persistent gaps.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Cherokee is an endangered Indigenous language. Revitalization efforts often include offering Cherokee language instruction, but these efforts have been hampered by a lack of qualified teachers. An initial licensure program was launched in fall 2019 aimed at supporting Cherokee language renewal via the preparation of teachers. While a step forward, little is known about this program and the extent to which it meets the needs of Cherokee language teacher candidates. In response, we conducted a year-long case study to chronicle the experiences of a Cherokee language teacher as he completes this program. Results confirmed that teachers of Indigenous languages may still be developing language proficiency and may lack resources, rendering instruction more challenging. Findings also shed light on beneficial program characteristics (e.g., attention to lesson and unit plan design) and emphasized the need for greater involvement of the Indigenous community in teacher preparation programs.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this essay, two women of Color researchers examine the intersections of race and disability and ask, “What is the power and purpose of positioning and positionality statements?” Informed by Black feminist theory, and drawing from the DisCrit tenets of intersectional oppressions, historicity, and whiteness and ability as property, the authors focus on researchers’ positioning in relation to how they engage and communicate knowledge about multiply marginalized people. Positionality statements, they argue, must be more than a listing of identities or a claim on authority through the naming of professional proximity to marginalized communities. Recognizing the increasing expectations for education scholars to articulate positionality in their scholarship, the authors offer a three-pronged intersectional framework, with provocations about the onto-epistemic, sociohistoric, and sociocultural elements of positioning. Education researchers interested in conveying how intersectional oppressions effect knowledge production will find this framework useful for crafting positionality statements that consider the multidimensional nature of power, oppression, and research in relation to their field, the literature, and multiply marginalized participants.

          Abstract
                  <p>The capacity to interrogate data with critical thinking is a strong predictor of statistical literacy (SL). This data interrogation, from the data consumers’ perspective, incorporates four complex response skills: interpreting, communicating, evaluating, and decision-making, and those skills are strongly supported by students’ appreciation of three interrelated knowledge components (text and context, representation, and statistical-mathematical knowledge). Due to the need to be critical data-information readers, students’ SL should develop during their formal schooling. The aim of this paper was to investigate differences in SL between Indonesian year 9 and year 12 students and between female and male students. The same test was administered to 48 year 9 students (50% females) and 48 year 12 students (50% females) from 16 different schools in Indonesia. Findings revealed that the highest percentage of year 9 and 12 students demonstrated evidence of consistent but non-critical thinking (level 4), suggesting that they exhibited their statistical knowledge but not in critical ways. There were 42% of year 9 students showing limited statistical thinking (levels 1 to 3) compared to 17% of year 12 students. Furthermore, while there were no significant gender differences in students’ SL and its all skills, the study shows significant grade level differences in overall SL as well as in its skills except interpreting. Implications of this study include the development of a framework that provides a coherent assessment of students’ SL from a data consumers’ perspective, along with suggestions for classroom teaching.</p>

                  <p>The Creativity of an Aha! Moment and Mathematics Education presents the implementation of Bisociation and constructivist theory into mathematics learning in school and college. The book has two goals: (1) to look into classroom facilitation, emergence, and depth of knowledge assessment of an Aha! Moment insight, and (2) to look into the connections between Bisociation theory and the fields of creativity and learning theories. This edited volume consists of empirical and conceptual studies comprehensively and in-depth about the creativity of Aha! Moments. This book is the first book that contains the application of Aha! Moments that will certainly encourage readers from mathematics and natural science teachers, human creativity researchers, librarians, and computer experts to dig deeper into the concept and application of creativity Aha! Moments. The volume’s editors hope that readers will have new opportunities to reflect on the critical role of creativity in learning and teaching mathematics at schools.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>New York City offers an example of the national trend to expand dual language bilingual education (DLBE) programs, yet only a small proportion of multilingual learners are enrolled in these programs in city schools. Our examination of new DLBE programs in three city schools builds on research about the “gentrification” of DLBE. Specifically, our findings show how school leaders opened DLBE programs to re-engineer the demographics of their student population by enrolling more White, privileged students in the name of “school turnaround”—namely, to increase enrollment and popularity in a school choice context and improve performance on accountability measures.

          Abstract
                  <p>The aim of this study is to advance understading of teachers’ and researchers’ work, in particular its cultural specificities, from a resource perspective by exploring the issues and challenges faced during the translation of a theoretical framework, the Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD), from Western (English and French) to East Asian languages (Chinese and Japanese). A basic assumption is that the challenges encountered while translating are driven by the cultural and linguistic differences that exist between the West and East. Adopting the perspective of the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD), we frame the translation work as a transposition process of research praxeology (a model of the researchers’ practices and knowledge) from a Western to an Eastern institution. We investigate this process to identify cultural elements at different levels (school, society, civilization, etc.) using the ATD framework. After translating a DAD article into Chinese and Japanese separately, we then worked collaboratively to identify similar or diverse translation issues and investigated their origins. Consequently, the results revealed a considerable difference between the West and East, and ample similarities between China and Japan, especially in terms of the researchers’ work and its relationship with the teachers’ work.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This mixed-method study examines Michigan’s Partnership policy for school turnaround, which positions the district and superintendents as key policy implementation actors. We first interviewed 21 of 35 Partnership superintendents/leaders across Michigan and surveyed teachers to understand the initial response to the turnaround policy and the strategic planning process. We then used our understanding of these leaders’ responses to conduct a purposively sampled embedded multiple comparative case study of three varied districts. These case studies helped us more deeply understand and compare how districts engaged in the process of crafting coherence and school-level stakeholders’ perceptions of activities related to coherence and implementation of the reform. Based on these two levels of data collection and analysis, we found that many leaders used the opportunity to create new changes, roles, and partnerships, but the majority also symbolically adopted policy demands by aligning their turnaround plans with pre-existing efforts. Using cross-case comparisons of our three districts, we argue that some degree of strategic buffering from policy demands may be warranted, especially when districts have low capacity and face significant challenges recruiting and retaining teachers.

          Abstract
                  <p>Good stories, literary or mathematical, have the ability to keep the reader engaged and wanting for more. However, poorly designed stories may also elicit a negative aesthetic reaction and thereby reduce engagement. By drawing on literary theory and Dietiker’s (For the Learning of Mathematics 33(3):14–19, 2013; Educational Studies in Mathematics 90(3):285–302, 2015) theoretical framework of mathematical stories, this essay conceptualises two aspects of mathematical stories that are likely to be perceived by the readers as aesthetic deficiencies: mathematical cheap plot tricks and mathematical plot holes. Additionally, examples of them are proposed from various areas of mathematics curriculum and some ideas of how they can be avoided, so as not to hinder engagement, are offered.</p>
