          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: In 2003, Bloom, Hill, and Riccio (BHR) published an influential paper introducing novel methods for explaining the variation in local impacts observed in multi-site randomized control trials of socio-economic interventions in terms of site-level mediators. This paper seeks to improve upon this previous work by using student-level data to measure site-level mediators and confounders. Research Design: Development of asymptotic behavior backed up with simulations and an empirical example. Subjects: Students and training providers. Two simulations and an empirical application to data from an evaluation of the Health Professions Opportunity Grants (HPOG) Program. This empirical analysis involved roughly 6600 participants across 37 local sites. Measures: We examine bias and mean square error of estimates of mediation coefficients as well as the true coverage of nominal 95-percent confidence intervals on the mediation coefficients. Results: Simulations suggest that the new methods generally improve the quality of inferences even when there is no confounding. Applying this methodology to the HPOG study shows that program-average FTE months of study by month six was a significant mediator of both career progress and long-term degree/credential receipt. Conclusions: Evaluators can robustify their BHR-style analyses by the use of the methods proposed here.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>School practices and policies are often influenced by various research, nonprofit, for-profit, and philanthropic organizations. To help understand their influence, this article provides a framework accounting for the variety of school improvement organizations (SIOs) and summarizes debates regarding their benefits and risks. I cluster SIOs as providing (a) direct school support, (b) research/advocacy, or (c) funding—each with a continuum of organizations underneath them. Studies highlight how SIOs take innovative risks, create improvement networks, and transform school practices. However, they also emphasize the danger of creating challengers to public institutions, the possibility of state retreat, and loss of community input. The article concludes by suggesting ways to use this framework for future studies, assess SIOs’ outcomes, and address their risks.

          Abstract
                  <p>This qualitative study aimed to identify the changes in a prospective’ conceptions about the nature of mathematical tasks and pedagogy in video cases and to investigate the characteristics of the prospective’ professional knowledge and views during task design/modification. The study used the mathematical task demand engagement process, which includes task-sorting activity, selecting tasks, reflecting on illustrative cases, and teaching and reflecting on tasks as enacted. The findings regarding one prospective, Kar, were reported. Focus group interviews, individual interviews, and two recorded lessons were used as data sources. The content analysis method was employed for the in-depth analysis of the data. The findings suggested a change in Kar’s ideas about the nature of mathematical tasks, particularly about what characteristics low and high-level tasks possess and the efficiency of the Task Analysis Guide. Kar also generated detailed ideas on the pedagogy of high and low tasks and realized the role of teachers as facilitators while enacting high-level tasks. Another finding is that Kar’s decisions regarding task adaptation and her reasons catalyze both situated and global knowledge and views. Our findings suggest that providing an opportunity for prospective to reflect on and discuss the nature of mathematical tasks as planned, implemented, and revisited in a professional context is beneficial.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>While there is no shortage of scholarship on “equity” in higher education, researchers typically examine whether a policy or practice is (in)equitable rather than how those responsible for designing and enacting a policy or practice make meaning of equity. Using a sensemaking framework and case study approach, I explored the collective meaning-making of practitioners at one community college during a time of increased policy attention to equity. Despite lacking a formal definition after 2 years of meaning-making, practitioners labeled specific ideas and activities as equity, suggesting the development of an implicit understanding. From this case, I offer five lessons to propose the concept of “equity sense,” a practitioner-constructed, contextually bounded meaning with implications for practice, policy, and research.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Research on how COVID-19 school closures impacted the learning of young children is still sparse, and the broader implications of these findings have yet to be fully explored. In this study, we examine the impacts of COVID-19 school closures on language and literacy development in a state-funded pre-K program in a Florida school district. Using COVID closures as a natural experiment, we additionally explore the implications of these findings for the literature on the efficacy and dosage of state-funded pre-K programs. We used propensity score matching to compare children from the COVID cohort (n = 1,211) to children from a pre-COVID cohort (n = 1,167). Results revealed no significant difference on the Florida Kindergarten Readiness Screener (FLKRS) assessment between the two cohorts at kindergarten entry. The COVID cohort had significantly higher scores on each of the individual subdomains of the FLKRS than the pre-COVID cohort, with especially large positive effect sizes for constrained literacy skills. Results indicate that COVID-19 closures did not have significant negative impacts on pre-K children’s language and literacy skills at kindergarten entry. Findings further suggest that state-funded pre-K programs with comparatively less funding and lower quality ratings may not provide adequate support for children’s language and literacy outcomes.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>We examine the effects of disseminating school-level academic performance data—achievement status, achievement growth, or both—on parents’ school choices and their implications for racial, ethnic, and economic segregation. Many researchers consider growth to be a superior (if still imperfect) measure of school effectiveness relative to status. Moreover, compared to status, growth has weaker relationships with schools’ demographic compositions. We conduct an online survey experiment featuring a nationally representative sample of parents and caretakers of children ages 0–12. Participants choose between three randomly sampled elementary schools drawn from the same school district. The provision of status information guides participants toward schools with higher achievement status and fewer Black, Hispanic, and economically disadvantaged students. The provision of growth information and the provision of both types of academic performance data guide participants toward higher growth schools. However, only growth information—alone, and not in concert with status information—tends to elicit choices with desegregating consequences.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Given the current threat posed by toxic digital content, preparing students to evaluate online sources cannot be relegated to a single subject area—this instruction should happen across the curriculum. This article focuses on materials designed to teach students to evaluate online information across subject areas. ninth-grade biology and world geography teachers taught a series of curriculum-embedded lessons based on the following design principles: (a) Focus on a core question and strategy; (b) engage students in evaluating real online content; (c) feature cognitive apprenticeship and formative assessment; and (d) support teacher learning. We examine whether these lessons helped students become more skilled evaluators of online content. Pretest/posttest data (N =574) showed statistically significant growth in students’ ability to evaluate the credibility of online content. We analyze the role played by the curriculum design principles in this interdisciplinary intervention and explore implications for future initiatives.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Co-operative inquiry was conceived as an authentic science of humans as self-determining persons. But what if we extend our definition of persons to include beings in the more-than-human world – and indeed the cosmos itself – as sentient and responsive? This paper gives some account of a series of co-operative inquiries with human and river persons worldwide, drawing on living cosmos panpsychism to address questions of the kind, What would it be like to live in a world of sentient beings rather than inert objects? The paper includes some narratives of encounters with animals who appear at our river encounters, and reflects on the veracity claims we are making.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/erxb'>Wednesday, 07. June 2023</a> | 
        
          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The adoption of growth strategies based on foreign trade, especially in the previous century when liberal policies began to dominate, is one of the main reasons for the increase in output and indirectly for environmental concerns. On the other hand, there are complex claims about the environmental effects of liberal policies and thus of globalization. This study intends to analyze the effects of global collaborations involving 11 transition economies that have completed the transition process on the environmentally sustainable development of these nations. In this direction, the effects of financial and commercial globalization indices on carbon emissions are investigated. The distinctions of globalization are used to distinguish the consequences of the two types of globalization. In doing so, the de facto and de jure indicator distinctions of globalization are used to differentiate the consequences of two types of globalization. In addition, the effects of real GDP, energy efficiency, and use of renewable energy on environmental pollution are dissected. For the main purpose of the study, the CS-ARDL estimation technique that allows cross-sectional dependency among observed countries is used to separate the short and long-run influences of explanatory variables. In addition, CCE-MG estimator is used for robustness check. According to the empirical findings, the economic growth and increasing energy intensity increases carbon emissions, but the increase in renewable energy consumption improves environmental quality. Furthermore, trade globalization does not have a significant impact on the environment in the context of globalization. On the other hand, the increase in de facto and de jure financial globalization indices results in an increase in carbon emissions, but de jure financial globalization causes more environmental damage. The harmful impact of de jure financial globalization on environmental quality suggests that the decreasing investment restrictions and international investment agreements of transition countries have been implemented in a manner that facilitates the relocation of investments from pollution-intensive industries to these countries.

                  <p>We report on a group theory activity in which learners explored dihedral symmetries through a tangible geometric model. This approach has historical roots in the work of Felix Klein’s Erlangen Program and his Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint. We situate our study with respect to this history as well as current educational research in spatial visual reasoning, abstract algebra, and teacher knowledge. Our findings highlight opportunities that tangible geometric models can provide for fostering structural and interconnected understanding characteristic of teachers’ knowledge at the mathematical horizon.</p>

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Black students face hyper-disciplining and high levels of social control when they enter American schools. The cultural mismatch hypothesis attempts to explain this hyper-disciplining by arguing that the mostly White teaching force misinterprets the attitudes and behaviors of Black students, which leads to their hyper-disciplining. Utilizing a longitudinal, deeply iterative, participatory, and critical ethnographic research process, however, this article shows that traditional scholarship around the cultural mismatch hypothesis is insufficient. The analysis indicates that teachers’ misinterpretation of mismatched capital (the traditional cultural mismatch hypothesis) is actually a racialized interpretation of both matched and mismatched capital coming from Black students, and such racialized interpretations are guided by the logic of antiblackness endemic to American institutions. Hence, this research argues for the integration of antiblackness as a theoretical tool to expand upon cultural mismatch explanations and for the creation of educational spaces where Black students are recognized, valued, and treated with dignity and humanization.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Broadband is not equally accessible among students despite its increasing importance to education. We investigate the relationship between broadband and housing policy by joining two measures of broadband access with Depression-era redlining maps that classified neighborhoods based in part on racist and classist beliefs. We find that despite internet service provider self-reports of similar technological availability, broadband access generally decreases in tandem with historic neighborhood classification, with further heterogeneity by race/ethnicity and income. Our findings demonstrate how past federally-developed housing policies connect to the digital divide and should be considered in educational policies that require broadband for success.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we investigate the links between prospective elementary teachers’ (PTs’) ability to notice student mathematical thinking, their mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) and their ability to decompose learning goals into component conceptual parts (Morris et al., 2009). Previously, researchers have proposed theoretical connections between MKT and teachers’ professional noticing, but empirical support for these relationships has been limited. Results of this mixed-methods study indicate that PTs who scored higher on an MKT assessment outperformed their peers in terms of attending to student thinking but had similar performance in terms of interpreting that thinking. However, PTs who were able to conceptually unpack a learning goal into subconstructs performed higher-quality interpretations of student thinking. We hypothesize that the skill of decomposing learning goals may allow PTs to apply their mathematics knowledge to successfully interpret student work. These results have implications for understanding how noticing and MKT may develop in relation with each other.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Educators increasingly recognize the importance of students’ learning orientations, but relatively little is known about how these mindsets vary across and potentially shape educational settings. We use nationally representative data to document contextual variation in mathematics orientations in U.S. high schools. We find systematic variation in orientations between differentiated course levels within school, suggesting orientations are more a feature of proximate instructional contexts than general school climate. Between-course variation in orientations is comparable to analogous sorting on demographic characteristics and not primarily explained by prior achievement. Measures of individual learning orientations at scale hold promise for understanding collective educational contexts.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Practices incorporating students’ cultures and communities are foundational to effective teaching. However, teacher candidates often do not effectively incorporate culturally based practices into their instruction. This article describes the perceptions of English education instructors as they reconceptualized their curriculum to cultivate culturally based practices. Findings show three major factors impacted the instructors’ reconceptualization of curriculum: (a) the instructors’ cultural roots; (b) the pervasiveness of whiteness—systems and processes that preference white identities, assumptions, and privileges that accompany the white experience; and (c) deep-seated tensions between culturally based practices and the practices of the university operating within the institution of English education. The authors assert that no individual who has matriculated through white-centric educational institutions and broader societal structures can be excluded from the call to unlearn whiteness. They urge teacher educators to dismantle oppressive, white-centric practices by reflecting on the interplay of biases and socio-political beliefs that they and their teacher candidates bring into educational spaces.

          Abstract
                  <p>Definitions are an integral aspect of mathematics. In particular, they form the backbone of deductive reasoning and facilitate precision in mathematical communication. However, when multiple non-equivalent definitions for the same term exist, their ability to serve these purposes can be called into question. While ambiguity can be productive, the lack of an agreed upon definition can make the truth value of certain mathematical statements unclear. In this study, we presented pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers with three mathematical claims in which definitional ambiguity was a consideration; then, we asked them to determine the correctness of each claim, justify their positions, and anticipate what reasoning might lead to a possible counterargument. Based on their responses, we identified several factors that influenced the participants’ approaches in each situation as well as cross-cutting themes that describe their considerations. Finally, we consider the pedagogical implications of employing such a task in teacher preparation programs and in-service teacher education.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>This quantitative study aims to explore the validity of Donohoo et al.’s (2020) Enabling Conditions for Collective Teacher Efficacy Scale (EC-CTES) for fostering collective efficacy in schools and evaluate its relationship to measures of collective teacher efficacy. The instruments used for this study include the EC-CTES, the Collective Efficacy Scale (CES-SF), and the Collective Teacher Beliefs Scale (CTBS). The data were evaluated through confirmatory factor analysis, correlation matrices, and multiple regression models. The findings from this study demonstrate that the EC-CTES is a valid tool. The EC-CTES subscales are positively associated with measures of collective teacher efficacy. We recommend adjustments for the EC-CTES subscales for greater congruence with collective efficacy theory and practical application. Due to the theoretical density of collective teacher efficacy, a modified conceptual framework is proposed to make the enabling conditions theory more accessible to practitioners.
