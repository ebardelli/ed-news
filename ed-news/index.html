          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The asymptotic posterior normality (APN) of the latent vector in an item response theory model is an important argument in modeling and inference. For a single latent trait, Chang and Stout proved its APN for binary items under general conditions, which generalized Chang for polytomous data and Kornely and Kateri for multivariate latent traits (MLT) and binary items. As MLT and polytomous items are nowadays common in psychometry, an APN-theory covering both simultaneously remains an open and ongoing problem. We generalize the APN-theory accordingly, providing thus a broader foundation for developments relying on APN. We also prove consistency of common estimators for the MLT, extending the according results of Chang and Kornely and Kateri.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study explores how observed emotion-focused teaching in preschool classrooms differs across classroom activity settings. Forty-three teachers were observed across several mornings. A total of 1,604 video cycles were coded for levels of emotion-focused teaching (e.g., total, modeling, responding, and instructing) and their activity settings (e.g., mealtimes and transition). Activity settings seemed to afford—to varying degrees for different teachers—the opportunity to interact with children around their emotional learning. Small-group activity settings had the highest levels of emotion-focused teaching, and mealtimes had the lowest. Emotion instructing occurred most often during whole-group interactions, and emotion modeling occurred most often during children’s independent work. Findings can inform the creation and implementation of professional development to promote these emotion-focused teaching practices. While research is increasingly demonstrating the value of emotion-focused teaching, understanding the variability of such practice over the various activity settings may identify opportunities to enhance the intentional support of children’s emotional learning.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>To ensure that new teachers enter classrooms poised for success, we need more evidence regarding supports that can expedite skill development during teacher education. In this study, we capitalize on mixed-reality simulations as a setting for evaluating such supports. Using a randomized control trial, we examine the extent to which coaching improves text-focused instruction compared to the more typical practice of self-reflection. Then, employing a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, we qualitatively and quantitatively explore the extent to which candidates’ individual characteristics might influence the effectiveness of those supports. We find that, on average, coaching is the more effective support for skill development, but we also surface potential drivers of heterogeneous effects of both coaching and self-reflection, including self-efficacy, extraversion, and prior skills. We conclude with implications for teacher education programs and researchers.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Sunday, 20. October 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Because data-informed decision-making (DIDM) can help teachers meet diverse learners’ needs (van Geel et al., 2016), educator preparation programs (EPPs) must ensure that preservice teachers (PSTs) develop the data literacy skills needed for effective data use. However, little is known about the ways in which EPPs work towards building PSTs’ data literacy, despite licensure and accreditation requirements compelling EPPs to do so. In this study, we analyzed survey, document, and interview data from Virginia EPPs to determine what present practices for DIDM preparation are taking place across the state. Results point to a lack of uniformity among EPPs for how preparation is undertaken, and that PSTS seem to have limited coursework on data use. Additionally, there appears to be minimal collaboration between EPPs and clinical partners, such that PSTs infrequently have opportunities to engage in DIDM during field experiences.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Milner advances curriculum punishment as a tool to describe how students may be harmed with policy and practice moves in education. Curriculum punishment pushes students and curriculum apart—where practices do not connect with and align with rich and robust diversity among young people, families, and communities. Although curriculum practices should honor, reflect, speak from the point of view of, deepen knowledge about, nuance myopic and mundane notions of, and enhance student identity, motivation, interests, and needs, curriculum punishment does the opposite by presenting one-dimensional, under-substantiated, and untruthful narratives and themes of individuals, communities, and nation-states. Tenets that explicate practices that Milner describes through curriculum punishment are (a) Avoiding, (b) Scripting, (c) Narrowing, (d) Distorting, and (e) Banning. Although some of these practices are beyond the control of teachers, teachers are encouraged to Study, Collaborate with others about, Reflect on, Advocate against, and Transform (SCRAT) Curriculum Punishment.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>During summer, children’s activities are dependent on their families’ and communities’ resources, raising concerns about inequalities in access to summer enrichment experiences. In this research brief, we use nationally representative data from the 1999 and 2011 ECLS-K cohorts to examine trends in kindergarten children’s summer enrichment activities over time by socioeconomic status and race. Although we find that persistent inequalities characterize many of these experiences, there were some promising trends, including small shifts upward in summer home academic activities. We discuss implications and future research directions.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This article provides robust empirical evidence for the association between science teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and student achievement. Unlike previous studies, we employed two approaches (text-based vs. video-based tests) to assess if, and to what extent, teachers’ PCK assessed by these two approaches are related to student achievement. An analysis utilizing two-level hierarchical linear modeling revealed that PCK assessed by both types of tests reveals a significant and positive association with student achievement. Teachers’ PCK assessed by the video-based test better predicted student achievement than teachers’ PCK assessed by the text-based test. Based on this result, we discuss implications for research on teacher knowledge and policy implications for teacher education.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Whole-school reforms have received widespread attention, but a critical limitation of the current literature is the lack of evidence around whether these extensive and costly interventions improve students’ long-term outcomes after they leave reform schools. Leveraging Tennessee’s statewide turnaround reforms, we use difference-in-differences models to estimate the effect of attending a turnaround middle school on student outcomes in high school, including test scores, attendance, chronic absenteeism, disciplinary actions, drop out, and high school graduation. We find little evidence to support improved long-run student outcomes—mostly null effects that are nearly zero in magnitude. Our results contribute to a broad call for educational researchers to examine whether school reforms meaningfully affect student outcomes beyond short-term improvements in test scores.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The recent COVID-19 pandemic and an emphasis on improving access to international education experiences have spurred researchers and practitioners to consider global experiences without international travel. Domestic study away programs can broaden access to intercultural learning for postsecondary students. This systematic literature review, the first known attempt to review the literature on study away, explores how researchers and professionals have previously discussed these opportunities. We draw from 59 publications to understand how study away is defined; conceptual, theoretical, and methodological approaches to investigating study away; common programmatic features; and learning outcomes. We find that study away is often ill-defined, and many empirical publications do not utilize theoretical or conceptual frameworks in their exploration. Learning outcomes attributed to study away were most commonly either psychosocial or related to attitudes and values. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners and highlight directions for future work.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The current climate reflects not only a hostile politicization of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work but also an institutionalization of anti-DEI sentiments through legislation and litigation, leaving educational institutions to operate within a hyper-legalistic environment. Although there are a large number of education attorneys who interface regularly with educational institutions, the field of education knows very little about contemporary models of collaboration between attorneys for educational institutions and the values that inform these collaborations. In this article, we aim to illustrate the significant role of attorneys for P–20 educational institutions, the need for more research to help us better understand existing strengths and limitations, and ways to harness this role in meaningful ways to further DEI commitments.

Short-term effects were established in a previously published real-world effectiveness randomized controlled trial. In the present quasi-experimental study, we examined the extent to which the effects remained approximately 1 year after the intervention. Because the original control group eventually also got the intervention, we compared mandatory municipal language assessment outcomes of 2,327 children in the treatment group to matched nontreatment children. The intervention effect was maintained at similar magnitudes at the 1-year follow-up for oral language skills (effect sizes = 0.09–0.14), and spillover effects were found for rhyming skills (effect size = 0.12).

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Research suggests that longer commute times may increase employee turnover probabilities by increasing stress and reducing job attachment and embeddedness. Using administrative data from a midsized urban school district, we test whether teachers with longer commute times are more likely to transfer schools or exit the district. Both descriptively and in regression results employing multiple fixed effects, we find that teachers with longer commutes are more likely to transfer schools within the district. Regression results show that each 5-minute increase in one-way commute time predicts an increase in transfer probability of 0.8 to 1.0 percentage points over most of the commute time distribution. We also find evidence that teachers with the longest commutes (i.e., 40+ minutes each way) have higher district exit probabilities. Moreover, teachers with longer commute times are absent from work more frequently and receive lower observation ratings. We discuss potential implications for local human resources policy and practice.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study investigated the effects of the Leader in Me (LiM), a social-emotional learning program implemented in thousands of schools. A mixed-method design included (1) a collective case study in four diverse, high-implementing elementary schools and (2) a post hoc quasi-experiment using propensity score 1:3 matching of 117 LiM and 348 non-LiM schools to compare achievement and discipline incident rates. The case study indicated that participants perceived LiM as improving social-emotional competencies for both teachers and students. Teachers reported being more prosocial, feeling more camaraderie, using more effective discipline, developing better teacher-student relationships, and enjoying teaching more. Students were more prosocial, confident and motivated, and had fewer problem behaviors. School climate improved. Results replicated across four diverse schools. The quasi-experiment supported results of the collective case study. Schools implementing LiM had higher mathematics and ELA, but not science, scores on state proficiency exams and fewer discipline incidents.

Using data from 265 observations of math instruction in preschool, kindergarten, first-, and third-grade classrooms in New York City public schools, we explore P–3 instructional alignment as it would be experienced sequentially, over time and across grades, by students. We examine the continuity of developmentally appropriate instructional environments and high-quality pedagogical practices, as well as the progression of P–3 mathematics content coverage. We find notable discontinuities in instructional environments and some pedagogical practices, particularly across preschool and kindergarten. We also find both progression and repetition in math content coverage. Results suggest that, on some dimensions, kindergarten may be poorly aligned with both preschool and the early elementary grades.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article considers the future of teacher education through researching the impact of encouraging cosmopolitan perspectives in an undergraduate children’s literature course for preservice teachers. The research question focuses on how preservice teachers respond to reading and dialoguing through a cosmopolitan lens. Reading literature through a cosmopolitan lens entails a reflexive consideration of personal convictions and a reflective openness to learning from the perspectives of others. The results of this study provide insights into how preservice teachers understood a cosmopolitan response. The results also highlight the need for further critical inquiry into how to invite greater reflexive consciousness and reflective openness to other perspectives in preparing teachers for a diverse society.
