          Abstract
                  <p>The study reported in this paper contributes to the literature on prospective teachers’ decision making, specifically regarding how they analyze and make informed decisions about the use of their textbooks. We designed a training intervention with 28 future Costa Rican teachers, in which they had to identify and manage semiotic conflicts that can be found in a textbook lesson. For this purpose, we selected a lesson on proportionality from a textbook commonly used in Costa Rica. We performed an interpretive and exploratory content analysis of teachers’ responses to the textbook lesson assessment tasks. The results show that participants progressed in identifying semiotic conflicts and could produce effective solutions for some of the detected semiotic conflicts. The prospective teachers reflected on the way they used the lesson by proposing improvements in more than one facet (epistemic, cognitive, affective, interactional, mediational, and ecological). We conclude that the training provided allowed the participants to progress in decision making regarding the use of the textbook lesson, although it is necessary to reinforce their didactic-mathematical knowledge on proportionality so that they can develop more critical and well-founded analyses.</p>

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 8-13, October 2024. <br>Transforming schools through mastery learning may solve education's existential crisis, offering today’s learners the relevance and individualization they need while returning to the most ancient form of assessment, proving that learning has occurred. Mastery learning requires significant change to all the norms and practices of school, altering time, space, culture, technologies, and pedagogies. Ira David Socol and Pam Moran share how, in Virginia, Kentucky, and Nevada, statewide innovation networks provide schools with the support, coaching, and peer encouragement required for sustainable change. Backed by both public and private organizations, these networks meet in-person and virtually, work synchronously and asynchronously, and communicate with stakeholders to build fundamental change.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 14-18, October 2024. <br>A mastery-based learning model has limited value in secondary English classrooms, particularly as it relates to writing instruction. Kelsey Hammond and Chelsey Barber argue against the focus on standardized benchmarks that are tied to mastery-based models in favor of an approach to writing that is explorative, personal, and imaginative. The rise of artificial intelligence writing tools like ChatGPT further challenge the traditional mastery paradigm by replicating formulaic writing tasks. The authors advocate for a shift toward fostering self-actualization, empathy, and creative expression in students, emphasizing writing as a means of personal growth and social discourse rather than a mere demonstration of skill.

Nancy R. Singer, Amy Lannin, Maha Kareem, William Romine, and Katie Kline report on the STEM Literacy Project, a three-year National Science Foundation grant that aimed to improve STEM teachers’ knowledge and integration of literacy in their classrooms. They describe teachers’ professional learning, scenario-based assessments and other strategies they incorporated in their STEM classrooms, and how writing enables students to understand real-world issues.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 28-33, October 2024. <br>Demetrius Fuller developed the HOMies, eight characters who represent eight habits of mind for learners, while he was an art teacher at a Massachusetts elementary school. When students began talking about the HOMies outside their art class, the initiative spread across the school. Linda Nathan, Demetrius Fuller, and Nate Meyers describe the HOMies and unpack the key ingredients involved in scaling a good classroom practice throughout an entire school. They look at the role of involving teachers from different subject areas and with different perspectives in the program. This example shows how teachers and leaders can ensure that innovative ideas can be shared and sustained so that schools can continually evolve to find ways to meet student needs.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 34-38, October 2024. <br>Dialogue, listening, and compromise are essential elements of living in a democracy. In a highly partisan time, is it possible to reestablish common ground when it comes to how best to educate our children in and for democracy? Authors Brendan Sheran, Ashley Carey, Jack Schneider, Rebecca Woodland, and Kathryn McDermott, who are affiliated with Center for Education Policy (CEP) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, outline a process called deliberative polling. They used this process of bringing citizens together in a structured way to deliver information and allow for questions and discussion in their Civic Summit. The event, in which Massachusetts citizens discussed the pros and cons of an upcoming state ballot measure on high school graduation exams, was an example of how a summit can bring people together to discuss, safety ask questions, and debate education issues.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 56-57, October 2024. <br>Phyllis L. Fagell offers advice to educators. In this issue, a teacher is frustrated that her teaching assistant will only work with students receiving special education services and won’t help address misbehavior among other students. A principal needs help dealing with a teacher giving him the silent treatment because he couldn’t accommodate a request from her.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 20-23, October 2024. <br>Some students learn better if they can apply skills and knowledge to their lives. Youth apprenticeships are a way for students to work and gain skills in a chosen career field and earn money while still in high school. Youth apprenticeships are on a continuum of work-based learning that includes job shadowing and internships. Apprenticeships require a yearlong commitment from the students and employers, and students often graduate from high school with career credentials and college credits. Schools and employers must work together to make the experience a success for all participants.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 42-46, October 2024. <br>The promotion and measurement of standards in compulsory education systems has been a prominent feature of Western education systems for centuries. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) have made the limits of current standards-based approaches to assessment more evident. Louis Volante, Don A. Klinger, and Christopher DeLuca discuss the importance of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills for the future success of schools. More authentic assessments, some of which leverage AI, can assess students’ performance in these essential domains.

Robinson looks back at her short stint as an early child care worker after Hurricane Katrina displaced thousands of classroom teachers. Robinson recalls that the work was rewarding but made more difficult by the low pay and the constant turnover of teachers and providers. She worked two other jobs to make ends meet. She advocates for increased pay and support for early childhood education teachers.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 39-41, October 2024. <br>Shifts in the education system to more student-centered learning will require state and local education agencies to rethink how they do their work. Current accountability systems focus on compliance with standards, as demonstrated in annual summative assessments. Mark Elgart explains that a new approach to accountability will offer more authentic and flexible assessment options and give schools support for continuous improvement in response to assessment results. Instead of focusing on compliance and testing, state education agencies can shift to offering options for assessment and resources for professional development. Local education agencies would be responsible for providing accountability data to the state and providing professional development on how to use assessment data for continuous improvement.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 2, Page 52-53, October 2024. <br>Being retained in a grade can have long-term consequences for students, and certain students are disproportionately likely to be retained in their grade. Robert Kim considers grade retention as a potential civil rights issue. Thus far, courts have been reluctant to overrule schools’ decisions in this area. However, cases that illuminate large disparities among students or that tie grade retention clearly to other acknowledged civil rights violations might invite greater judicial scrutiny.

Many teachers told her that they were looking for professional development that was more meaningful than what their districts offered, and research indicates that this desire is common. Stoffel shares how her return to public education enabled her to better understand what kinds of professional learning teachers want and need.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This field study examined factors that might influence hand raising in students with high levels of shyness. Data were assessed using student self-reports of shyness and social relatedness factors (student-teacher relationship and peer relationship), observations of instructional factors (wait time, warm calling, class size, and school subject), and behavioral measures of hand raising among 204 middle school students during a school week. Multilevel analyses show that student-teacher relationship and warm calling facilitate hand raising of highly shy students, but also that they less likely raise their hands the better their peer relationship. Thus, the results suggest that both social relatedness and instructional factors can promote hand raising in highly shy students, opening the gateway to their oral participation.
