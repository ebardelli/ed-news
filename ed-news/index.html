          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this conceptual article, we argue for the need to examine power relations in continuous improvement (CI) in education. Specifically, we contend that examining power in CI requires an examination of practices that constitute the work of CI. Drawing on practice theory, we conceptualize practice and power and use these constructs to examine a CI effort on improving mathematical proficiency in an elementary school. From this case, we draw out three power moves to illustrate how examining power through practice in CI can generate insight into the varied power dynamics in a CI effort. We end by arguing for more examinations into the practice of CI work to understand power relations and the enactment of CI efforts in education broadly.

          Abstract
                  <p>Although there has been increasing attention to the importance of teacher agency in professional development, there has been little attention to what it takes to facilitate collaborative work that both centers teachers’ assets and expertise and leads to productive learning. This paper presents a framework for focused and responsive facilitation of productive discourse around instructional practice in teacher learning communities. Drawing on a situative perspective, we trace the development of six novice teacher leaders as they were mentored to lead online collaborative lesson design groups focused on analyzing artifacts of K-8 mathematics instruction in a large urban district in the US. Our framework articulates how leaders facilitated the discussions in ways that both built on teacher knowledge, experiences, and contributions while also focusing on professional learning goals. Our analysis also shows how rich learning opportunities were co-constructed and sustained by the mentors, teacher leaders, and participants in each group over time. Through narrative descriptions of one group, we show how the teacher participants began to take on some of the facilitation practices themselves as they apprenticed into the practices of the community. This approach to professional learning positions teachers’ experience and knowledge as important assets while supporting them to try out and reflect on new classroom practices.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We present the 2-year experimental mixed-methods findings of a two-generation English as a second language (ESL) program. This program combines a high-dosage, child-oriented curriculum for parents with Head Start for children in addition to family-based supportive services. At baseline and after 2 years, 189 Latinx and Zomi immigrant parents completed surveys while children completed skill assessments. A subset of 67 parents participated in focus groups regarding their experiences. Treatment parents reported significantly higher English writing skills and self-esteem and significantly lower language brokering and material hardship. There were no significant differences in children’s outcomes. Possible explanatory mechanisms across multiple contexts were identified in the qualitative data. Evidence is promising that a Two-Generation ESL Program improves some outcomes for parents.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Although research indicates that individual students benefit when they enroll in early algebra classes, evaluations of broad-based algebra acceleration often report negative effects. Using a regression discontinuity design, we replicate the positive effects of eighth-grade algebra placement on student achievement found in prior studies. We then demonstrate that eighth-grade algebra placement positively affects the achievement level of students’ classmates, as well as the experience and value added of students’ math teachers. Peer composition effects may help to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the positive effects of algebra on individual students and negative effects of algebra acceleration since these estimated effects are large enough to plausibly explain the majority of the effects of eighth-grade algebra on student test scores.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this exploratory study, we investigate undergraduate students’ engagement with generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) in proving mathematical statements. We selected six mathematical statements to conduct interviews with three students. We present the emergent framework, Students’ Interactive Proving Experience with AI (SIPE-AI), which explains the processes of students’ use of genAI in their proving and the factors influencing these processes. Our findings identify three factors that shape students’ use of genAI: conceptions of proof, conceptions of genAI, and ethical considerations. The results suggest a need to guide undergraduate students in critically engaging with genAI tools, rather than passively accepting their outputs. We also discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing undergraduate mathematics education by fostering informed and critical use of genAI in mathematical proving.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article we analyze how students reason about linear combinations across multiple digital environments. We present the work of three groups of undergraduate students in the Southeast United States (US) who were considered ready to take linear algebra. The students played the game Vector Unknown, reflected upon aspects of their gameplay using GeoGebra, and used that knowledge to design a level for a 3D version of the game under some constraints. We performed a grounded qualitative analysis of each student’s activity to identify key episodes of student reasoning about linear combinations using technology. Both authors reviewed the episodes and categorized them according to the type of student activity. We compared their reasoning in 2D and 3D space to understand how they made the transition and finally linked these episodes to the technology used to understand its role in building student understanding. We identify four forms of structuring space: Reasoning with Numeric Sums, Reasoning with Resultant Vectors, Reasoning with Tip-to-Tail Vectors, and Reasoning with Vectors as Points. We found that how the technology represented vectors and linear combinations influenced how students engaged in structuring space.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Learning is here considered to have taken place when someone has developed the habit, propensity, and disposition to attend productively to things not previously noticed, and in ways not previously experienced, to do with some specific and particular content. ‘Active learning’ sounds like a tautology, but was introduced as a contrast to the more passive activity of students sitting in lectures listening and transcribing mathematics written on a board or screen onto their own paper. The stance taken here is that effective and efficient learning involves active engagement in activity, but includes enculturation through being in the presence of a relative expert1 who themselves is manifesting mathematical thinking, not simply passing on the records of the results of previous mathematical thought. Such ‘passivity’ does not necessarily require intention. Following Bennett2 actions are here taken to involve three agents or impulses: initiating, responding, and reconciling or mediating. All three agents are thus active, but in different ways. Interactions intended to contribute to learning are considered to be actions, and so involve three agents: learner, teacher (in some manifestation), and mathematical content, all within a culture or ethos. Since there are six different ways in which the triple of agents can be assigned to the triple of impulses, six different modes are possible. Analysing these modes sheds light on different ways in which learning could be said to be ‘active’. Activity takes place within a mode of interaction. Again following Bennett, effective activity is here taken to require appropriate relationships among the gap between current state and intended goal, the resources available, and the tasks set.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Research–practice partnerships around educational research may have beneficial outcomes but also present tensions. By considering the dynamics of manifested tensions, our study aims to understand how teachers engage with the various stages of the research in an inquiry-based professional development community consisting of eleven in-service teachers and three mathematics education researchers. In light of Heider's Balance Theory, we identify and analyze tensions expressed by teachers in the community discourse. Findings indicate that epistemic tensions related to teachers' and researchers' different cultural orientations act as powerful generators of inclusionary and exclusionary actions shaping community members' participation paths. While downplaying epistemic tensions can evoke individual actions detrimental to learning and destructive to the community's existence, awareness of and well-timed coping with tensions can become a springboard for community development.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, the Education Studies Department (ESD) at Berea College shares lessons learned while becoming an inclusive, justice-focused, and democratic Education Preparation Program (EPP) together with its “Community of Teachers” (CoT). ESD values diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI+B) and democratic relationships. These values influence how we do our work. We begin by sharing how the theoretical framework of Community of Practice (CoP) frames our case study. After explaining how a CoP applies to ESD’s approach to educator preparation, we give an overview of Berea College. We share some of its history and its eight Great Commitments. We detail how ESD is a unique EPP compared with other more traditional EPPs. Next, we chronicle the story of how ESD “walks its talk” and invests in the teacher profession. We detail the participants of the case study, outline our methodology of the case study, and share the data we analyzed for this article. Data were analyzed and three emergent themes were discovered about the praxis of ESD: (a) community-engaged and justice-focused teacher preparation, (b) community building within teacher preparation programs, and (c) diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. The article concludes by sharing implications for EPPs and a conclusion.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Early literacy assessment has become commonplace in the preschool years, with phonological awareness constituting one component of emergent literacy targeted by such practices. This within-subjects experimental study examines the role of word familiarity on 93 dual language preschoolers’ performance on phoneme-level awareness tasks in three-phoneme words. A researcher-designed digital tool created individualized test items (foils and target responses) for each child. Half of the items presented target responses that contained familiar words, and half contained unfamiliar words. Results suggest unknown/unfamiliar target words yield lower phonological awareness performance scores.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Given the prominence of international instructors in higher education, understanding their grading practices is essential for informing college grading debates. This first large-scale assessment of undergraduate grading practices highlights how different demographic, classroom and departmental factors shape international instructors’ grading behaviors. Using a unique dataset of over 2,000 randomly selected instructors from three public universities, we examine (a) whether undergraduate-level grading practices differ between domestic and international instructors, (b) what factors contribute to the differences, and (c) whether the differences vary across key subgroups. We find that international instructors grade lower than domestic instructors—about 35% of a standard deviation lower on average. Part of this gap is explained by the concentration of international instructors in particular departments. International instructor grading practices differ across regions of origin, prior U.S. higher education experience, gender, and race. Our results provide insights into U.S. college grading debates and supporting the international instructor workforce.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>While we continue to see a growing push for the restoration and codification of recess in elementary schools, policy does not necessarily equal practice. Georgia recently passed legislation requiring at least 20 minutes of recess per day for students in PK-5. The purpose of this research study was to survey elementary school educators to reveal the temporal (i.e., duration, frequency, and cancellation practices) and descriptive (i.e., type, equipment, place) characteristics of recess in Georgia’s public elementary schools. The results of this study, which can be summed up statistically and descriptively as less recess overall, and less free play specifically, as well as reduced access to safe play spaces since the onset of the pandemic, yield important policy implications for Georgia’s school children. These implications relate to persistent disparities in immediate and long-term positive outcomes for children across multiple domains including academic, social-emotional, and behavioral.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study investigates the overrepresentation of Black students in special education by looking at the association of race and related variables with referral, identification, and placement. Analyses were performed on a statewide sample of students and teachers to investigate relationships between student, teacher and school demographics, and special education identification and placement. The results find (1) black students assigned to black teachers are less likely to be identified for special services, (2) black students are less likely to be in inclusive placements with increases in white student enrollment, and (3) black students are more likely to be identified for special services and placed in more restrictive settings.

          Abstract
                  <p>Identifying mathematically gifted students is an important objective in mathematics education. To describe skills typical of these students, researchers pose problems in several mathematical domains whose solutions require using different mathematical capacities, such as visualization, generalization, proof, creativity, etc. This paper presents an analysis of the solutions to two problems by 75 students (aged 11–14), as part of the selection test for a workshop to stimulate mathematical talent. These problems require the use of the capacity for mathematical generalization of solution methods. We define a set of descriptors of such capacity, use them to analyze students’ solutions, and evaluate how well students with high capacity for generalization can be distinguished from average students. The results indicate that the two problems are suitable for identifying potential mathematically gifted students and several descriptors have high discriminatory power to identify students with high or low capacity for generalization.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Constructive matching and response elimination strategies are two primarily used cognitive strategies in Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM), a valid measurement instrument of general intelligence. Identifying strategies is necessary for conducting studies on the relationship between cognitive strategy and other cognitive factors and for cognitive strategy training. However, the strategy identification method used in research is either subjective, or the information in the behavior data is not fully utilized, or it is limited by the size of the sample and cannot be widely used. Therefore, this study trained a convolutional neural network-based visual computational model (CVC) for cognitive strategy identification based on eye movement images. Focusing on the APM, the trained CVC can be used for strategy identification by learning and mining the pattern information in the eye movement images with predefined training labels from a psychometric model. An empirical study was conducted to illustrate the training and application of the CVC. Utilizing the trained CVC and a developed graphical user interface application, the primary finding of the study reveals a high level of agreement in strategy identification between the CVC and the psychometric model, as well as between the CVC and expert judgment. This implies that, akin to the psychometric model, the CVC can be used to identify the two cognitive strategies of constructive matching and response elimination. Overall, the proposed deep learning-based model follows the data-driven perspective and provides a new way of studying cognitive strategy in the APM by presenting objective and quantitative identification results.

          Abstract
                  <p>The development of professional digital competencies is an important condition for a meaningful integration of digital technologies in mathematics education. A widely used and empirically studied approach for the professional development of in-service teachers are teacher design teams, in which lessons are collaboratively planned, implemented and reflected. However, this approach has not yet been considered for the collaboration of pre-service and in-service teachers. Therefore, this article examines in a holistic case study mixed teacher design teams composed of pre-service and in-service teachers. A total of 23 interviews were conducted with pre-service and in-service teachers and analyzed by inductive development of categories using the method of qualitative content analysis. The case study shows among other things, that the different prerequisites of the participants can lead to a relatively clear division of roles within the collaboration, which turns out to be suitable for the professionalization of both pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this study, we examine the real-time decision-making processes of a teacher in a UK post-16 mathematics classroom focusing on the integration of student-centred teaching methods. The contribution of this study is a transdisciplinary theoretical discussion which links teachers’ actual classroom practices (often traditional and teacher centred) with their professed student-centred perspectives. Utilising Abductive Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis, this research incorporates cognitive, social psychological, sociocultural theory and perspectives on affect in the context of in-the-moment decisions. Through co-construction, we identify distinct but overlapping agentic and ecological dimensions of decisions. Recognising that teachers’ spontaneous decisions in the classroom are shaped by both their agency and the social and physical ecology of the classroom, this study provides a structured approach to understanding how diverse disciplinary concepts are related, and paints a dynamic picture of the process of teacher decision-making. This is crucial for identifying both limitations and possibilities in teacher education and professional development.</p>
