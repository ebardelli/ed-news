          Abstract
                    <p>Recent research in university mathematics education has moved beyond the traditional focus on the transition from secondary to tertiary education and students' understanding of introductory courses such as pre-calculus and calculus. There is growing interest in the challenges students face as they move into more advanced mathematics courses that require a shift toward formal reasoning, proof, modeling, and problem-solving skills. This survey paper explores emerging trends and innovations in the field, focusing on three key areas: innovations in teaching and learning advanced mathematical topics, transitions between different levels and contexts of mathematics education, and the role of proof and proving in advanced university mathematics. The survey reflects the evolving landscape of mathematics education research and addresses the theoretical and practical challenges of teaching and learning advanced mathematics across various contexts.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>While natural language documents, such as intervention transcripts and participant writing samples, can provide highly nuanced insights into educational and psychological constructs, researchers often find these materials difficult and expensive to analyze. Recent developments in machine learning, however, have allowed social scientists to harness the power of artificial intelligence for complex data categorization tasks. One approach, supervised learning, supports high-performance categorization yet still requires a large, hand-labeled training corpus, which can be costly. An alternative approach—zero- and few-shot classification with pretrained large language models—offers a cheaper, compelling alternative. This article considers the application of zero-shot and few-shot classification in educational research. We provide an overview of large language models, a step-by-step tutorial on using the Python openai package for zero-shot and few-shot classification, and a discussion of relevant research considerations for social scientists.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher resilience literature has expanded rapidly with a large number of publications and an evolving knowledge base. To capture a synthetic account systematically and effectively, this review provides a bibliometric approach to quantitatively examine the metadata of 692 relevant publications during the 26 years from 1998 to 2023.The finding traces the field’s progression from an initial concern for at-risk children to early conceptual discussions of resilience and, ultimately, more in-depth theoretical, empirical, and experimental investigations of teacher resilience, particularly within specific contexts like language teaching. However, the future trajectory of this domain remains an open question.The bibliometric review also enabled the researchers to anchor future research directions and contemplate the key challenges, such as the need for more international collaborations, concerted efforts to study teacher resilience across varied contexts, and the need to carefully balance productivity and influence when conducting new studies. Overall, this review aims to spark thoughtful discussions among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers regarding teacher resilience, in order to establish a more sustainable and global knowledge base.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The importance of the school environment in the development and achievement of youth has been well-documented. Racial inequities within the school environment may lead to differential schooling experiences and perceptions between racially minoritized youth and their White peers. Differences in school racial climate contribute to the achievement gap and impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite this understanding, school racial climate literature remains underemphasized due, in part, to the absence of a unifying model of school racial climate. The current article discusses the importance of school racial climate as conceptually distinct from school climate, provides an overview of existing literature across fields, and identifies factors for consideration in advancing school racial climate research.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study, using a scriptwriting task, examines how 52 Czech pre-service mathematics teachers (PMTs) handled a situation in which a fictional pupil’s incorrect reasoning resulted in a correct answer. The participants were asked to imagine and provide a script that reflects how the situation could evolve in response to the pupil’s incorrect reasoning with a correct answer (IRCA). We found some PMTs allowed the teacher in the scripts to take an active role in directing pupils to realize the IRCA and refute it through counter-examples. After orienting pupils, the teacher moved pupils’ thinking forward by foregrounding new strategies towards a more preferred strategy. However, some PMTs allowed pupils in the scripts to take more responsibility in recommending alternative strategies in response to the IRCA and justify the strategies. PMTs suggested teacher involvement or intervention in creating counter-examples considerably more frequently than letting pupils in the scripts provide alternative strategies and justifications. The results of the study highlight the important role of PMTs in harmonizing teaching strategies in their scripts with the curricular necessities and cognitive developments of pupils.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The rise of interest in data science raises questions about what changes may be needed in how we address the teaching of statistics with primary children. In this paper, we use a broad definition of data science to outline three foundational aspects that could be addressed during the schooling years: (1) reasoning with data; (2) computational thinking; and (3) inquiry-based learning. Drawing on video data and artefacts from a primary classroom in Australia (children aged 9–10 years old), we examined how a class generated and grappled with a complex, ambiguous problem about the risks and benefits of their activities in cyberspace. The interdisciplinary lesson sequence engaged the children with non-standard data, data privacy, and ethical issues in age-appropriate ways. The analysis used an iterative process that annotated video logs, identified and transcribed critical events linked to these three foundational aspects, and coded these data to make connections within and across the data. The findings suggest a process for introducing children to age-appropriate problems that can be addressed by data science that reflect contexts in their world. Implications of the study provide teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers suggestions for embedding data science education into primary school.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Standard item response theory (IRT) models are ill-equipped for when the probability of a correct response depends on the location in the test where an item is encountered—a phenomenon we refer to as position effects. Unmodeled position effects complicate comparing respondents taking the same test. We propose a position-sensitive IRT model that is a mixture of two item response functions, capturing the difference in response probability when the item is encountered early versus late in the test. The mixing proportion depends on item location and latent person-level characteristics, separating person and item contributions to position effects. We present simulation studies outlining various features of model performance and end with an application to a large-scale admissions test with observed position effects.

          Abstract
                  <p>Research incorporating either eye-tracking technology or immersive technology (virtual reality and 360 video) into studying teachers’ professional noticing is recent. Yet, such technologies allow a better understanding of the embodied nature of professional noticing. Thus, the goal of the current study is to examine how teachers’ eye-gaze in immersive representations of practice correspond to their attending to children’s mathematics. Using a mixed methods approach, we incorporated eye-tracking technology embedded within a virtual reality environment to compare novice and expert teachers’ gaze duration with quality of professional noticing. Findings and results both corroborate and extend previous research evidence about important differences in professional noticing between expert and novice teachers. Specifically, the amount of experience, and thus familiarity, teachers have with being in a classroom may affect their physical movement in both real and virtual representations of practice. Additionally, findings and results emphasize the importance of teachers’ visual focus on students’ doing of mathematics across the classroom.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Federal entitlement policies like Title III and the IDEA help grant multilingual learners (MLs) and students with disabilities (SWDs) access to public schools. Yet they have operated in ways that continue to “other” the very student populations they intend to integrate. Drawing on social network surveys and semi-structured interviews collected from one urban district over 18 months, we ask: To what degree do central office leaders share responsibility for instructional decision-making in literacy and math? And, how did organizational conditions disrupt or perpetuate the “othering” of MLs and SWDs among central office staff? Leveraging a conceptual framework of critical social network analysis and institutional theory, we found that, despite efforts to promote joint-work and shared responsibility across central office departments, regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive dimensions of the institutional environment continued to “other” special populations leaders from content-area leaders and, thus, the core of instructional decision-making.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Higher education scholars have studied white supremacy and whiteness to understand the ways racial inequity persists in the academy; however, scholars mostly focus on individual and social levels of analysis such as individual ideologies or macro systems of oppression. Recent literature on racialized organizations have begun to address whiteness, but we have yet to fully understand how whiteness functions within organizations to reproduce racial inequities and sustain white supremacy as a racialized hegemonic power. Furthermore, there is little evidence on how organizations and their leaders support or resist whiteness. In this systematic review of whiteness in higher education research from the past 20 years, I identify a gap in the literature—that whiteness in higher education organizations is under examined. To begin to redress this gap, I designed a conceptual framework that examines how white supremacy as a hegemonic and racialized power via whiteness functions and is potentially contested in higher education organizations.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>PK–12 district-level administrators have been asked to navigate an increasingly complex policy landscape concerning gender-diversity reforms. We apply sensemaking theory to examine administrators’ understanding of legal and policy protections for trans and gender diverse (TGD) students. Using 36 interviews with administrators and policy consultants, we examine whether PK-12 district administrators (a) know about existing legal and policy protections, (b) tie policies to administrative actions, (c) build capacity for structural gender reforms, and (d) proactively learn about gender diversity. We use these categories to delineate among resistant, emergent, and gender-inclusive leadership approaches along the Gender-Inclusivity Leadership Spectrum. Our findings suggest PK–12 leaders would benefit from additional implementation strategies and education concerning gender diversity, even in states with protective legislative mandates for TGD people in schools.

          Abstract
                  <p>The study aimed to advance knowledge into what is data-ing, a process defined whereby people engage with data, how and why they were gathered, and how they will be used in the future. Utilising a novel interdisciplinary approach, first-year microeconomics and humanities students wrote contextualized stories as part of their coursework in 2022 and 2023. Neither course taught statistics, with contextualised storytelling defined here as a process that involves learners drawing on one’s identity or life experiences, including things they do, and that have happened to them, their families, friends, or communities. Nine participants volunteered for the exploratory study, each submitting one story to the researchers. Four stories were selected based on showing the most potential for research purposes. Data analysis saw the researchers annotate and code the four participants’ stories, then analyse critical events. Tentative findings revealed how data-ing using contextualised storytelling might help students make sense of discipline specific concepts in courses that are rich in statistical language. The activity of data-ing also suggests students can identify variables and use statistical or mathematical statements that they may or may not be aware of, suggesting there may be value in embedding statistics into non-statistics disciplines to support student learning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Using structural equation modeling, a previous study investigated the longitudinal relationships of role-related mathematics identity, efficacy, and interest to grade 12 mathematics performance. The results indicated that both mathematics identity and educational expectations at grade 11 were statistically and substantively significant predictors of grade 12 mathematics achievement in the presence of other factors such as grade 9 mathematics achievement, high school mathematics coursetaking, educational expectations at grades 9 and 11, as well as student and school background socio-demographic factors. The current study uses multiple group structural equation modeling and shows that the model derived in the previous study holds for males and females equally well. The study also found that females’ levels of motivation (except for interest) were lower than males’ at both points in time and that the males’ and females’ means on the motivation variables declined equally from grade 9 to grade 11. Implications of the findings are discussed.

This emotional burden can lead to stress and mental health consequences. Institutions bear the responsibility of addressing the emotional burden. This multiple-case qualitative study aimed to identify effective institutional strategies to alleviate emotional labor. We interviewed 107 leaders at eight institutions to examine their experiences with emotional labor and institutional support. We selected institutions based on their progress toward DEI. Leaders were chosen based on being involved directly in the DEI work within a shared leadership effort. Drawing on Ahmed’s theory of diversity work and Zembylas’s critical emotional praxis, we identified the following themes: sharing DEI responsibilities with many leaders, creating spaces for emotions, and role-modeling the desired behaviors to build positive relationships and trust. Through these strategies, institutions can reduce emotional labor and create equitable environments for DEI leaders.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Early colleges are a model of schooling that combines the high school and college experiences, providing students the opportunity to simultaneously earn a high school diploma and an associate degree or 2 years of college credit. This article updates findings from a 17-year longitudinal experimental study of the model, examining the impact of the model on postsecondary performance and completion. The study found positive impacts on overall degree completion, with very large impacts on associate degree completion. There were also positive impacts on bachelor’s degree completion for low-income students and first-generation college-goers. For students who enrolled in a public 4-year institution, the study found positive impacts on advanced coursetaking. There was no difference between treatment and comparison students on final college GPA or on the percentage of students who double-majored. Treatment students who earned a bachelor’s degree did so more quickly than comparison students.
