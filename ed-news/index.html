          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>When beginning readers read aloud, the teacher’s feedback affects their reader identities. Teacher’s feedback may also imprint a strong model of what reading is and what proficient readers do. This systematic review investigates the characteristics of teachers’ feedback on elementary students’ reading and furthers its potential to support students’ agency in learning to read. A total of 52 empirical studies in K–5 settings were identified and analyzed. Findings suggest clear associations between how feedback was presented and what aspects of reading were targeted: typically, either explicit feedback on decoding or implicit feedback on meaning. Further, support for student agency was more strongly associated with implicit feedback practices. Finally, two groups of students—struggling readers and L2 learners—tended to receive feedback that does not promote agency. The review concludes by discussing the potential of feedback practices to support students in becoming proficient and independent readers.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The inequitable distribution of principal effectiveness raises concern among policymakers. Principal sorting likely contributes to wider achievement and opportunity gaps between low- and high-need schools. As a possible policy tool, policymakers proposed performance-based compensation systems (PBCS). Tennessee was one of the states that supported the implementation of PBCS. This study examined the relationship between PBCS and principal job performance in the state, using longitudinal administrative data, principal evaluation data, and unique PBCS data from 2012 to 2019. The study did not find consistently significant, positive relationships between PBCS and principal job performance. However, the relationships were generally more pronounced among high-need schools. The study concludes with detailed discussions about the results, the assumptions behind PBCS, limitations, and implications.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Observed-score test equating is a vital part of every testing program, aiming to make test scores across test administrations comparable. Central to this process is the equating function, typically estimated by composing distribution functions of the scores to be equated. An integral part of this estimation is presmoothing, where statistical models are fit to observed score frequencies to mitigate sampling variability. This study evaluates the impact of commonly used model fit indices on bivariate presmoothing model-selection accuracy in both item response theory (IRT) and non-IRT settings. It also introduces a new model-selection criterion that directly targets the equating function in contrast to existing methods. The study focuses on the framework of non-equivalent groups with anchor test design, estimating bivariate score distributions based on real and simulated data. Results show that the choice of presmoothing model and model fit criterion influences the equated scores. In non-IRT contexts, a combination of the proposed model-selection criterion and the Bayesian information criterion exhibited superior performance, balancing bias, and variance of the equated scores. For IRT models, high selection accuracy and minimal equating error were achieved across all scenarios.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Little has been dedicated to the experience and potential support for local educational policy actors, school board members, that were at the heart of unprecedented decision and sensemaking during the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing sensemaking theory and an interpretivist case study design, this study conducts interviews with four school board members in a Missouri school district. The study explores their motivations for candidacy and perceptions of the role’s responsibilities, especially as individuals elected during the pandemic. The findings highlight that candidates’ decisions to run are influenced by personal and professional experiences, shaping their initial understanding of the position. However, post-election, a transformative process unfolds in the actual enactment of the role, signifying an evolution in their sensemaking journey. This study contributes to the limited but growing literature on school board members who play critical roles in education and whose roles and responsibilities have often been overlooked in the scholarship.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite the growing availability of classroom measures, such measures rarely attended to the embodied nature of learning. This article describes the collaborative development of a practical measure to capture embodied participation in mathematics classrooms with four elementary school teachers—working with students at the intersections of multiply marginalized identities: students of color, emergent bilinguals, and students with disabilities—who informed the measure design and ensured that the data were actionable in their contexts. This article contributes to existing research on classroom measures by highlighting the value of attending to embodied learning through multiple modalities and representations of student participation. We further highlight how such a measure provides practical insights into participation that extend beyond verbal only measures.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>A controversial, equity-focused mathematics reform in the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) featured delaying Algebra I until ninth grade for all students. This study examines student-level longitudinal data on mathematics course-taking across successive cohorts of SFUSD students who spanned the reform’s implementation. We observe large changes in ninth and 10th grades (e.g., delaying Algebra I and geometry). Participation in Advanced Placement (AP) math initially fell 15% (6 percentage points), driven by declines in AP calculus and among Asian/Pacific Islander students. However, growing participation in acceleration options attenuated these reductions. Large ethnoracial gaps in advanced math course-taking remained.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Upper secondary education shapes gender segregation in higher education and the labor market. This study shows gendered elective course enrollment patterns in Chilean upper secondary education across seven subjects, examines their consistency across socioeconomic contexts, and identifies school-level moderators. Using national administrative data from 2012–2021 and multilevel models, we find that students make gender-stereotypical choices regardless of their prior achievement. Notably, in higher-socioeconomic-status schools, gender differences in enrollment are larger, suggesting that socioeconomic context amplifies gendered choices. Additionally, the gender culture of schools moderates segregation in field-of-study choices, indicating that the school environment plays an important role in shaping students’ educational trajectories. These findings highlight the need for targeted policies to address gender and socioeconomic disparities in education.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study highlights the efforts of a Detroit-based community research group to understand chronic absenteeism in a way that acknowledges its underlying complexities. Employing Participatory Action Research, an intergenerational team of community members and university researchers examined the disconnect between educators’ strategies for addressing chronic absenteeism and students’ lived experiences with barriers to regular attendance. The findings reveal a school environment characterized by a punitive attendance framework that constrained teachers’ ability to address absences effectively and allowed school leaders to shift responsibility elsewhere. In contrast, students who experienced chronic absenteeism articulated a vision for improving attendance through specific structural pathways, school improvement, and social-emotional support. The discussion emphasizes the need for strategies that uphold students’ dignity and support educators’ capacity to move beyond punitive attendance policies.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>In an effort to boost engagement while also nurturing 21st century skills such as collaboration and critical thinking, a growing number of U.S. public schools have expanded opportunities for students to engage in applied learning experiences via projects. This conceptual article explores the under-examined relationship between such experiences and the logic of neoliberal capitalism. The author explores how project-based learning, despite its potential as a lever for equity, sometimes takes up neoliberal capitalist tropes such as individualism, competition, profit maximization, the commodification of learner-made artifacts, and market-based solutions to social problems. The article suggests that until the field embraces approaches to project-based learning which include a Freirian emphasis on criticality and praxis, capitalist logic will persist as a mechanism by which “real world” learning can perpetuate all-too-real systems of oppression.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>In this quantitative toponymic study, we examine U.S. public schools named after Confederates, enslavers, and segregationists (CESs). We find that 4.7% of all public schools (n = 4,172) had CES namesakes, although this number declined slightly after the BLM/George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. Most of these are named after enslavers, while 467 are named after Confederates and 210 after segregationists. While nearly one-quarter are named after presidents, the remaining three-quarters of namesakes have no such claim on American history. More than half of schools with CES namesakes reproduce their embedding geographies, highlighting how schools amplify the toponyms of other geographies and public spaces. Of particular concern, Black students are particularly concentrated in schools with Confederate namesakes. We discuss the potential harm of these “symbols” and conclude with policy implications.

          AbstractProspective college students—particularly students of color and those from low-income families—face a myriad of challenges applying to and enrolling in college, including constraints on information, financial aid, and academic preparation. Within the college search process alone, the number, diversity, and complexity of applications that students must complete represent substantial barriers to application and matriculation. A state-level common application seeks to reduce administrative barriers by allowing students to complete a single application to apply to multiple institutions. Using a difference-in-difference design that is robust to variation in treatment timing, we provide the first evidence on state-level enrollment impacts of these common applications. Despite the ongoing development and adoption of state common applications, we find no positive or negative effects on full-time equivalent enrollment in public higher education and show that the format of the common application (paper/online) does not matter. Rather, like strategies considered in other works, common applications may be most useful as a complement to more robust access and enrollment strategies. These findings should inform policy makers and serve as a foundation for future work examining the impacts of common applications on state and student outcomes.

          AbstractThe Advanced Placement (AP) program is widely offered in American high schools and has been touted as a way to close racial and socioeconomic gaps in educational outcomes. Using administrative data from Michigan, I exploit variation within high schools across time in AP course offerings to identify the relationship between AP course availability, AP participation, and postsecondary outcomes. I find that students from non economically disadvantaged families, White and Asian students, and higher-achieving students are more likely to take advantage of additional AP courses when they are offered, thus widening existing gaps in course-taking. I find little evidence that additional AP availability is related to improved college outcomes for any students, with the exception of the most academically prepared students. Expanding access to AP courses without additional incentives or support for disadvantaged students to succeed is unlikely to address educational inequality.

          AbstractThe Pell Grant, while offering substantial financial support for low-income students pursuing higher education, historically covered only the costs of two full-time semesters per year and did not include assistance for summer courses. Research has consistently demonstrated that continuous enrollment throughout the academic year enhances college persistence and degree completion. In response to this understanding, the Summer Pell (SP) program was introduced in the summer of 2009, providing eligible low-income students with an additional grant to cover summer tuition and related expenses. However, after a brief period of operation, the SP program was discontinued in 2011, only to be reinstated in 2017. We utilize administrative data obtained from New York City in the context of differences-in-differences analyses spanning both program periods, and find that SP-eligible students exhibited a higher retention rate in the fall of their second year, achieved higher rates of associate's and bachelor's degree attainment, and experienced greater earnings gains up to nine years after college entry compared with SP-ineligible students. Our analysis of heterogeneity further underscores that the benefits of the SP program were pronounced among Black students and older students.

          AbstractThis paper presents evidence that students with special needs (SN) have no impact on the academic achievement of their peers in primary and secondary schools in the Netherlands. Administrative data are used on all Dutch students who are in their final grade of primary and secondary education in the years 2015–18 and student and school fixed effect models are estimated to find this null finding. To establish if the results truly represent a null finding a conceptual framework for learning from null results is applied. These results support that the inclusion on students without SN has no impact: Point estimates are precise and coefficients are generally insignificant and inconsistent in sign. Our results nuance recent empirical findings, and provide further evidence that, depending on the educational context, inclusive education can be implemented without harming the academic achievement of students without special needs.

          AbstractCareer and technical education (CTE) has existed in the United States for over a century, and only in recent years have there been opportunities to assess the causal impact of participating in these programs while in high school. To date, no work has assessed whether the relative costs of these programs meet or exceed the benefits as described in recent evaluations. In this paper, we use available cost data to compare average costs per pupil in standalone high school CTE programs in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the most likely counterfactual schools. Under a variety of conservative assumptions about the monetary value of known educational and social benefits, we find that programs in Massachusetts offer clear positive returns on investment, whereas programs in Connecticut offer smaller, though mostly non-negative expected returns. We also consider the potential cost effectiveness of CTE programs offered in other contexts to address questions of generalizability.

          AbstractToday, all 50 states have enacted mandates requiring some level of insurance coverage for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this paper, I examine the impact of Massachusetts’ mandate, ARICA (An Act Relative to Insurance Coverage for Autism) on the academic and behavioral outcomes of students with ASD in the state. Using administrative data on Massachusetts public school students, I use a triple difference strategy to estimate impacts on special education setting, attendance, suspensions, and achievement. I find that ARICA increased inclusion for students with ASD; they were 4 percentage points more likely to be fully included after the reform. Further, days suspended decreased by about 26 percent, and the likelihood of receiving a suspension decreased by about 2 percentage points. I find that improvements in student outcomes were larger for students in grades 6–8 (versus elementary students). While I find no statistically significant improvement in test scores for students with ASD overall, math (English language arts) achievement increased by 0.09 (0.13) standard deviation for students in middle grades.

          AbstractHistorically, teacher evaluation systems have identified few teachers as low-performing and needing improvement. In 2012, at the beginning of a national reform movement, Chicago Public Schools implemented its overhauled evaluation system, which incorporated multiple measures of teaching practice and dismissal plans for low-rated teachers. We find that the reform increased the exit rate of low-rated tenured teachers by 50 percent. At the same time, the teachers who replaced the exited teachers were significantly higher-performing. Ultimately, the accountability function of the reformed teacher evaluation policy resulted in higher teaching quality. However, the policy impact was limited because very few teachers received low ratings under the reformed system. Policy simulation results suggest that the available teacher labor supply is likely sufficient to set a higher standard for satisfactory teaching.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Addressing the educational needs of students in math early on is critical given that early gaps in math skills widen further over the course of schooling. This study examines the effectiveness and costs of Kentucky’s Math Achievement Fund—a unique state-level program that combines targeted interventions, peer-coaching, and close collaboration among teachers to improve math achievement in grades K–3. The program is found to improve not only math achievement, but also reading test scores and non-test outcomes including student attendance and disciplinary incidents. The benefits exist across students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, and they are slightly higher for racial minorities.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In cognitive diagnosis, attribute hierarchies are considered important structural features of cognitive diagnostic models, as they provide auxiliary information about the nature of attributes. In this article, the idea of ordering theory is applied to cognitive diagnosis, and a new approach to identify attribute hierarchy based on the attribute correlation intensity matrix is proposed. This approach attempts to identify attribute hierarchy in data with a small sample size while ensuring a high accuracy rate. The results of simulation studies and empirical data analysis show that the proposed approach can be used to identify attribute hierarchy in diagnostic tests, especially in small samples, making it worth popularizing.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Refugee and asylum-seeking youth of color from African and Middle Eastern countries contend with racist-ableist structures in host-nation schools, primarily through newcomer supports offered to them. Considering their unique migratory experiences, this comprehensive systematic literature review explored how youth of color from Africa and the Middle East are supported in host-nation schools already entrenched in systemic racism and ableism. This review advanced precarious citizenship as a framework to explain student experiences. The findings showed how segregation and exclusion, ableist determinations of civic fitness, and assimilationist imperatives introduced precarity and foreclosed educational opportunities. Implications for research and practice are discussed, emphasizing the importance of disrupting racism and ableism in supporting newcomer youth of color.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The series of high-profile Black deaths in the United States between 2012–2022 (e.g., Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Breonna Taylor) mark an important turning point in studies of Black life in education. The increasing use of anti-Blackness theorizing coupled with the introduction of Black critical theory (BlackCrit) to the field of education has inspired new research investigations aiming to understand anti-Black racial harm more precisely. Growing interest in such study leads us to wonder how education researchers envision Black life in their work, and more specifically, the subject of Blackness and its relationship to notions of humanity. As scholars whose research demonstrates a disciplined intellectual commitment to Black humanity, we observe that a uniform scholarly conception of humanity + Blackness remains elusive. In this systematic review of 226 peer-reviewed articles, we seek to better understand (a) how education researchers conceptualize Black humanity in articles published during a period of intense social change and political upheaval in the United States (i.e., 2012–2022); (b) what specific claims they make about Black life as a result; and (c) what long-term implications emerge as a result of this knowledge production. Ultimately, this paper offers insight for sharpening the theoretical and interpretive heft of education research that probes the substance of Black people’s lived education realities, the knowledge from which is desperately needed to imagine, design, and steward education futures that all America’s children need to thrive.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Preschool has direct effects on attendees, but less is known about how public preschool expansions targeted to low-income children affect early educational experiences and school readiness in a broader community. We use Virginia administrative data (~630,000 students) and a discrete increase in targeted public pre-K (Virginia Preschool Initiative Plus [VPI+]) to estimate the effects of means-tested pre-K expansion on preschool participation patterns and school readiness. VPI+ expansion decreased the probability that children spend no time in licensed settings (6–7 percentage points), increasing the probability for public pre-K and private centers (5–8 and 2–3 percentage points, respectively). Kindergarten literacy skills improve (5%–6% of SD). Effects are larger among the target population but shared broadly (perhaps through private centers). These previously unmeasured benefits inform future policy and research.
