          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Collaborative relationships between families and teachers of elementary-aged children are complicated by teachers’ lack of training for family engagement and by hierarchical and racialized power differentials. Home visiting can create a space for teachers to center and honor families’ ways of knowing and being, but those home visits need to be conducted in ways specifically intended to build relationships with families; otherwise, the visits can do damage. In this descriptive exploratory study, we examined how teachers responded to families’ openings during home visits. We articulate a theory that describes actions teachers can employ to build rapport, particularly across difference. This work has implications for research on family engagement and for teacher preparation for home visiting.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This study leverages national data and a quasi-experimental design to examine the influence of enrolling in an exclusively online degree program on students’ likelihood of completing their degree. We find that enrolling in an exclusively online degree program had a negative influence on students’ likelihood of completing their bachelor's degree or any degree when compared to their otherwise-similar peers who enrolled in at least some face-to-face courses. The negative relationship between exclusively online enrollment and students’ likelihood of bachelor's degree completion was relatively consistent among White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, low-income, and military students. Findings focused solely on those students enrolled in exclusively online degree programs revealed that the negative influence of exclusively online enrollment was exacerbated when the student attended a for-profit 4-year institution.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) allows high-poverty schools to offer free meals to all students regardless of household income. Conceptualizing universal meal provision as a strategy to alleviate stigma associated with school meals, we hypothesize that CEP implementation reduces the incidence of suspensions, particularly for students from low-income backgrounds and minoritized students. We link educational records for students enrolled in Oregon public schools between 2010 and 2017 with administrative data describing their families’ household income and social safety net program participation. Difference-in-differences analyses indicate that CEP has protective effects on the probability of suspension for students in participating schools, particularly for students from low-income families, students who received free or reduced-price meals prior to CEP implementation, and Hispanic students.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study draws on quantitative reasoning research to explain how secondary mathematics preservice teachers’ (PSTs) modelling competencies changed as they participated in a teacher education programme that integrated modelling experience. Adopting a mixed methods approach, we documented 110 PSTs’ competencies in Vietnam using an adapted Modelling Competencies Questionnaire. The results show that PSTs improved their real-world-problem-statement, formulating-a-model, solving-mathematics, and interpreting-outcomes competencies. Showing their formulating-a-model and interpreting-outcomes competencies, PSTs enhanced their quantitative reasoning by properly interpreting the quantities and their relationships using different representations. In addition, the analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between PSTs’ modelling competencies and quantitative reasoning. Suggestions for programme design to enhance modelling competencies are included.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>To be able to support students’ competence development in solving physics problems over the course of a lesson series effectively, teachers need a proper appreciation of students’ deficiencies. As teachers commonly assess students’ competence by means of written tests, teachers are challenged to interpret students’ work on these tests and to intervene when some students fail to understand the proper application of solution methods in different contexts. This paper evaluates a formative assessment practice where teachers have been instructed to pinpoint students’ level of understanding of kinematics problems by means of a cognitive diagnostic instrument and to provide personalized hints that match students’ current level of understanding. The study is novel in this sense that the assessment of written tests results of students’ problem solving is not expressed in grades and pass rates, but in terms of cognitive level of understanding. The results show that teachers can determine and monitor shifts of performance of students’ cognitive level of understanding by using this instrument. Second, the results indicate that among students with low initial results, the group that received sufficient feedback via sticky notes made significantly more progress in solving problems than the group that did not receive feed forward on sticky notes. Third, the timing of feedback in the form of sticky notes did not affect on students’ progress in achieving mastery at the end of the instruction period. Our conclusion of this study is: Cognition develops through levels and tiers and support is essential to move to the Zone of Proximal Development. Subsequently, we evaluate group and subgroup implications for didactic interventions and propose suggestions for further investigations.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Principal preparation programs play an important role in developing future school leaders’ skills and practices. Internships, or structured opportunities for future leaders to engage in the work of school leadership in hands-on, authentic ways, are among the most essential components of principal preparation. Using longitudinal data from 12 programs in North Carolina, this study extends research on internships by examining the pathways of interns from prior- to post-internship employment. We find that internships are highly localized around interns’ prior- and post-employment schools but not their preparation program, with wide variability in placements between programs. Interns’ demographics do not play a large role in shaping the geography of internship placements. However, we find that preparation program type is strongly related to the geography of internship placements, suggesting that differences in program structure may shape internship placements. We conclude by highlighting the limitations and discussing implications for future research.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A critically important balance in educational measurement between practical concerns and matters of technique has atrophied in recent decades, and as a result, some important issues in the field have not been adequately addressed. I start with the work of E. F. Lindquist, who exemplified the balance that is now wanting. Lindquist was arguably the most prolific developer of achievement tests in the history of the field and an accomplished statistician, but he nonetheless focused extensively on the practical limitations of testing and their implications for test development, test use, and inference. I describe the withering of this balance and discuss two pressing issues that have not been adequately addressed as a result: the lack of robustness of performance standards and score inflation. I conclude by discussing steps toward reestablishing the needed balance.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Studies about collegiate food insecurity show its prevalence as a national issue that disproportionately affects students from marginalized groups. This study further contextualizes this work, examining the ways that multiply-marginalized students navigate systems of privilege and opportunity at selective, normatively affluent universities to meet food needs and pursue personal goals. Findings from this multi-institutional qualitative study highlight asset-based approaches by which students leverage institutional interest in their marginal identities as navigational strategies. Conclusions point to the value of “student pathways navigation” as a conceptual and analytic approach to understanding how students manage collegiate environments.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher education is at a critical crossroads as colleges and schools of education contend with decreased student enrollment, legislative strategizing to limit what is taught, and general pushback regarding what teachers should learn about teaching and their students. As such, the field of teacher education must examine how to collectively rebuff the current movement by policy makers and elected officials who have formalized their desire to maintain the status quo in education. They continue to lobby against social justice in education, critical race theory, multicultural perspectives in teaching, and culturally responsive and relevant pedagogical approaches to classroom instruction, among others. This paper examines the current moment in educational history and highlights opportunities that may transform teacher education policy to become more justice centered.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many educational policies hinge on the valid measurement of student economic disadvantage at the school level. Measures based on free and reduced-price lunch enrollment are used widely. However, recent research raises questions about their reliability, particularly following the introduction of universal free lunch in certain schools and districts. Using unique data linking the universe of students in Oregon public schools to IRS tax records and other data housed at the U.S. Census Bureau, we provide the first examination of how well different measures capture school economic disadvantage. We find that, in Oregon, direct certification provides the best widely available measure, both over time and across the distribution of school economic disadvantage. By contrast, neighborhood-based measures consistently perform relatively poorly.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We design a commitment device for college students, “Study More Tomorrow,” conduct a randomized controlled trial testing a model of its takeup, and measure its effect on tutoring attendance and grades. The device commits students to attend tutoring if their midterm grade falls below a prespecified threshold. Unlike other commitment devices tested in the education literature, the contract carries a financial cost for noncompliance. Students value the contract, with 10% takeup among those randomly assigned a contract offer. Takeup is not higher among students randomly assigned to a lower contract price, however. The contract does not robustly affect tutoring attendance or student course grades. Our results show that college students are willing to pay for study commitment devices.

          Abstract
                  <p>Over the past several decades, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners have placed an emphasis on inquiry-based science and mathematics instruction in elementary school. While inquiry-based science and mathematics instruction can support student learning and engagement, teacher preparation programmes have experienced challenges in preparing elementary teachers to use and maintain inquiry-based teaching practices. In this study, we describe how one teacher preparation programme in Canada partnered with a local elementary school to design a novel initiative that provided elementary preservice teachers with authentic opportunities to employ inquiry-based instructional practices for science and mathematics. Using a thematic approach, we explored 46 elementary preservice teachers’ beliefs, emotions, and feelings about the initiative and its impact on their future careers as teachers. We found preservice teachers were enthusiastic about the initiative and believed it had a positive impact on their future as teachers. The findings suggest implications for programmatic design in elementary teacher preparation programmes.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>The success and failure of education reform policies often depend on the strategies of reformers. This article suggests a framework to understand the positionality of reformers, as they vary in their strategy (i.e., technical vs. relational) and focus for change (i.e., process- vs. outcomes-focused). Using the case of individuals who initiated new data systems in Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City, the study discusses four groups of reformers: Engineers privilege efficient technical fixes that may be resisted by people on the ground. Capacity-builders focus on empowering schools but may lead to variable successes. Framers research and disseminate ideas to reframe policy and political discourses. Table-setters leverage their social networks and financial resources but may challenge democratic decision-making. As schools continue to be sites of political debates and challenges, the concept of positionality can clarify how reformers promote particular changes and can suggest possibilities for positions to constructively complement each other.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Research has demonstrated that pre-service teachers (PSTs) can learn to notice students’ thinking in sophisticated ways by analyzing videos of classroom interactions. What is less clear is how PSTs use what they notice about student thinking to inform how they respond. Secondary math and science PSTs from three teacher preparation programs were invited to analyze a video clip identifying noteworthy moments of student thinking and describing an instructional move they might make and why. A qualitative analysis of their responses indicates that the PSTs overwhelmingly noticed both the substance and the source of students’ ideas. However, the patterns in their responses to these moments varied. These findings suggest that PSTs would benefit from spending more time unpacking what it means to respond to students’ thinking. The study provides implications for teacher education with respect to the careful selection of classroom clips and tools to support novice teachers developing responsive teaching practices.

          Abstract
                  <p>This article presents the results of a study aimed at understanding potential implications of the project-based approach to teaching science and technology (S&amp;T). A survey of 221 secondary teachers shows that the meaning of this approach hangs on attributes that make it difficult to characterize and differentiate from other pedagogical approaches (e.g. the problem-based approach, interdisciplinarity, strategic teaching, explicit teaching). The objectives that respondents associated with the project-based approach have more to do with socialization than instruction; non-disciplinary skills are perceived to take precedence over teachings specific to S&amp;T. Moreover, the degree to which teachers use this approach trails far behind other approaches that do not compete with subject-specific learning (explicit teaching in particular). The challenges reported by the respondents—especially by the segment of teachers who claimed to have never used this approach—show the need for teacher training on the didactic foundations of this approach and the production of resources that would encourage its use in a way that promotes better learning in S&amp;T.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>While intelligence and motivational variables are well-established predictors of academic achievement, Need for Cognition (NFC), the stable intrinsic motivation to engage in and enjoy challenging intellectual activity, has not yet been considered comprehensively in this field, especially not longitudinally. By applying latent change score modeling, we examined the incremental value of NFC, considering well-established motivational constructs and prior achievement in the prediction of academic achievement across different subjects in a longitudinal approach across two time points in a sample of secondary school students ([math] = 271, [math] = 255). Correlations of NFC with grades were comparable to those of established predictors. NFC incrementally predicted academic achievement over and above prior achievement and ability self-concept. A mutual influence of NFC and academic achievement was found pointing to skill development as well as self-enhancement processes taking place in this interplay. Consequently, we propose to include NFC in models for the comprehensive explanation of academic achievement in school.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Although robots’ social behaviors are known for their capacity to facilitate learner–robot interaction for language learning, their application and effect have not been adequately explored. This study reviewed 59 empirical articles to examine the contexts and application of various social behaviors of robots for language learning, and conducted a meta-analysis of 18 study samples to evaluate the effect of robots’ social supportive behaviors on language learning achievement. Results indicate that robots’ social behaviors have mostly been applied in the studies with K–12 students, for learning vocabulary in English, including small sample sizes of below 80 participants, and lasting for one session. Second, various verbal and non-verbal behaviors of robots have been identified and applied, showing mixed results on language learning achievement. Third, robots’ social supportive behaviors have produced a positive effect on language learning achievement compared to neutral behaviors (g = 0.269). Finally, detailed suggestions for future research are discussed.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Computer programming provides a framework for interdisciplinary learning in sciences, arts and languages. However, increasing integration of programming in K–12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners’ cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators’ choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments’ suitability and alignment with learning objectives.
