          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>District “equity director” (ED) roles have grown rapidly over the past decade. Drawing on interviews and surveys with over 70 EDs across nearly 30 states, this study documents dramatic ED role growth from 2018 to 2022 specifically and examines why, according to EDs, such roles were established locally. Findings, drawing on scholarship on social activism, demonstrate how insider influence from district educators and leaders; intermediate pressure from community coalitions, parents, and students; and external coercion from state and federal education departments and civil rights agencies spurred ED role establishment. Challenges to ED efficacy are discussed, including ED role establishment as “checkbox” work and politicized attacks on district diversity, equity, and inclusion work.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>In states that fund public prekindergarten and kindergarten in elementary schools, principals are central to ensuring these programs support children’s learning and development. Yet few studies explore how principals position these programs within their instructional leadership and what they perceive should be done by district leaders to support their efforts to lead these programs. This case study investigated these issues with a sample of elementary school principals (N = 14) working in Texas. Using a modified conceptual lens that categorizes four essential dimensions of instructional leadership for prekindergarten and kindergarten, we found that principals possessed insight into many of these leadership practices but often did not enact these visions due to the academic performance pressures of the upper grades. Furthermore, principals wanted additional support from their district and state administrators to lead their prekindergarten and kindergarten programs better. Such findings illuminate several opportunities to strengthen principals’ instructional leadership of prekindergarten and kindergarten.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This interpretive phenomenological study reports the effects of reflecting on reflections concerning Critical Incidents (CIs) on the pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) professional development and conceptualization of their identity as TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) teachers. The study involved nine PSTs who were specializing in TESOL and doing their teaching practicum. The main instrument of the study was reflective writing, which required the PSTs to report CIs, write reflections, and share these for receiving peers’ reflections to further reflect on self-reflection and reflection of peers. The process enabled the participants to pursue professional development and conceive identity as TESOL teachers. This seemingly engaging, thought-provoking and meaningful reflective practice can be additive to the existing reflective practices, which have been questioned and debated in the literature. In pursuit of professional development and teacher identity, PSTs can be assigned to reflect on reflections with diverse elements of focus alongside CIs.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Chile has followed the international trend of implementing a standards-based reform, with the particularity of encompassing both academic and non-academic outcomes. Drawing on interview data from four school cases in Santiago, Chile, this study examines the role of attitudes in reform enactment, analyzing whether and how school actors’ attitudes toward academic and non-academic performance indicators influence practice change. Alignment between attitudes toward academic standards and practice change is often disrupted by subjective norms, whereas attitudes toward non-academic indicators consistently drive behavior. This research sheds light on the complex interplay between attitudes and policy enactment, offering valuable insights.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, college and career readiness became the central focus of education policy in the United States. Career academies (CAs) are a popular way to support students in their postsecondary transitions, but little causal evidence exists about whether this model of schooling is effective in promoting learning and transition outcomes. We capitalize on the adoption of the CA model in a large school district that was under the threat of school turnaround and employ a generalized difference-in-differences approach to test whether adopting this model improved student outcomes. We find suggestive evidence that CA adoption improved graduation rates and that these effects were most likely concentrated among schools that had the lowest graduation rates at baseline.

          Abstract
                  <p>The paper presents an analysis of elementary grade mathematics teaching in India focusing on mathematical reasoning. Mathematical reasoning is an important tool to make sense of mathematical ideas, which in turn makes mathematics more accessible to learners and promotes social equality. The paper analyzes 112 lessons from Grades 1 to 8 by 21 teachers in 5 schools in a big city in India. Synthesizing the literature, the paper identifies three main functions of mathematical reasoning (reasoning for sense-making, reasoning for inquiry, reasoning for justification) and concomitant reasoning actions. Working from these three functions of reasoning, a scheme that was suitable for categorizing the reasoning observed in the highly teacher-led instruction was developed and applied to identify the nature and prevalence of reasoning across grade levels and topics. No “reasoning for inquiry” was found in the analyzed lessons. Explanatory Reasoning, a limited form of “reasoning for sense-making” with little student input, was observed, usually in extremely short episodes, in about a quarter of lessons. Modelled Reasoning, a limited form of “reasoning for justification” where step-by-step deductive problem solutions were demonstrated, was more common, dominating lessons in some topics, especially in higher grades. In most lessons, the teacher stated rules and procedures without reason; sometimes providing non-mathematical justifications for procedures in lower grades (e.g., the need to follow arrows or use a mnemonic). The observed rarity of Explanatory Reasoning highlights an urgent need for teacher education programs in India to enhance the sense-making mathematical experiences offered to teachers so that they can, in turn, promote sense-making in their students.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The transition from elementary to secondary school presents challenges for students, including the shift from a streamed to a destreamed mathematics curriculum. This paper explores the Ontario context, where all students began taking the same grade 9 mathematics course in 2021–2022. The Grade 9 Mathematics Research Project investigated current practices, pedagogical strategies, and challenges in implementing the destreamed mathematics curriculum. A qualitative methodology involving semi-structured interviews with 16 in-service teachers explores their instructional practices and challenges in teaching the grade 9 destreamed mathematics course. The study revealed that teachers employed various strategies, including parallel tasks, open questions, and direct approaches to teaching basic mathematics skills. Collaborative planning enabled alignment and consistency across classrooms, while parallel assessments provided choice and accommodated diverse learning needs. Teachers identified challenges including limited time for planning and collaboration, lack of resources or textbooks, wide-ranging student abilities, the integration of coding into the curriculum, and pandemic-related disruptions. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing support, professional development, and resource allocation to facilitate effective teaching and learning in the mathematics classroom.</p>

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>A large body of scholarship focuses on how to prepare White teachers to teach students of Color and guide them to make sense of their Whiteness. Using testimonio, this article adds diversity to teacher preparation literature and makes space for Kelly, a Mexican American preservice generalist teacher, to share her story. In particular, I highlight how her relationships and language ideology influence her ethnic identity construction while participating in the figured worlds of 1) her family, 2) personal K-12 schooling experience, and 3) pre-service student teaching experiences. Kelly’s testimonio is a call to subvert monoglossic language ideologies, value translanguaging, and ultimately prepare PSTs with the self-reflexive capacity to engage in linguistically responsive and sustaining pedagogy.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The asymptotic posterior normality (APN) of the latent vector in an item response theory model is an important argument in modeling and inference. For a single latent trait, Chang and Stout proved its APN for binary items under general conditions, which generalized Chang for polytomous data and Kornely and Kateri for multivariate latent traits (MLT) and binary items. As MLT and polytomous items are nowadays common in psychometry, an APN-theory covering both simultaneously remains an open and ongoing problem. We generalize the APN-theory accordingly, providing thus a broader foundation for developments relying on APN. We also prove consistency of common estimators for the MLT, extending the according results of Chang and Kornely and Kateri.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims to shed light on an overlooked but essential aspect of informal reasoning and its radical implication to mathematics education research: Decentralising mathematics. We start to problematise that previous studies on informal reasoning implicitly overfocus on what students infer. Based on Walton’s distinction between reasoning and argument, and Ernest’s concept of intrapersonal dialogue, we propose two theoretical perspectives for understanding the roles of informal reasoning in argumentation: the semi-formal, and the negotiation perspectives. From the latter perspective, we can say that informal reasoning involves creating alternatives, eschewing the relatively unpromising ones, and choosing the most promising one. To illustrate the advantage of the negotiation perspective over the semi-formal perspective, we present two examples of students’ statistical written reports from a previous study. These examples illustrate that spontaneous concepts influenced the students’ creation of multiple alternatives, and choice of the most promising one, in informal reasoning. Therefore, to better understand the development of mathematical concepts, we need to recognise the role of spontaneous concepts through decentralising mathematics. Finally, we introduce inferentialism as an additional theoretical perspective for investigating both the mathematical development of spontaneous concepts, and the spontaneous development of mathematical concepts. The inferentialist idea of the game of giving and asking for reasons indicates how to empirically investigate the mutual development of spontaneous and mathematical concepts.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study explores how observed emotion-focused teaching in preschool classrooms differs across classroom activity settings. Forty-three teachers were observed across several mornings. A total of 1,604 video cycles were coded for levels of emotion-focused teaching (e.g., total, modeling, responding, and instructing) and their activity settings (e.g., mealtimes and transition). Activity settings seemed to afford—to varying degrees for different teachers—the opportunity to interact with children around their emotional learning. Small-group activity settings had the highest levels of emotion-focused teaching, and mealtimes had the lowest. Emotion instructing occurred most often during whole-group interactions, and emotion modeling occurred most often during children’s independent work. Findings can inform the creation and implementation of professional development to promote these emotion-focused teaching practices. While research is increasingly demonstrating the value of emotion-focused teaching, understanding the variability of such practice over the various activity settings may identify opportunities to enhance the intentional support of children’s emotional learning.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>To ensure that new teachers enter classrooms poised for success, we need more evidence regarding supports that can expedite skill development during teacher education. In this study, we capitalize on mixed-reality simulations as a setting for evaluating such supports. Using a randomized control trial, we examine the extent to which coaching improves text-focused instruction compared to the more typical practice of self-reflection. Then, employing a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, we qualitatively and quantitatively explore the extent to which candidates’ individual characteristics might influence the effectiveness of those supports. We find that, on average, coaching is the more effective support for skill development, but we also surface potential drivers of heterogeneous effects of both coaching and self-reflection, including self-efficacy, extraversion, and prior skills. We conclude with implications for teacher education programs and researchers.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Because data-informed decision-making (DIDM) can help teachers meet diverse learners’ needs (van Geel et al., 2016), educator preparation programs (EPPs) must ensure that preservice teachers (PSTs) develop the data literacy skills needed for effective data use. However, little is known about the ways in which EPPs work towards building PSTs’ data literacy, despite licensure and accreditation requirements compelling EPPs to do so. In this study, we analyzed survey, document, and interview data from Virginia EPPs to determine what present practices for DIDM preparation are taking place across the state. Results point to a lack of uniformity among EPPs for how preparation is undertaken, and that PSTS seem to have limited coursework on data use. Additionally, there appears to be minimal collaboration between EPPs and clinical partners, such that PSTs infrequently have opportunities to engage in DIDM during field experiences.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Milner advances curriculum punishment as a tool to describe how students may be harmed with policy and practice moves in education. Curriculum punishment pushes students and curriculum apart—where practices do not connect with and align with rich and robust diversity among young people, families, and communities. Although curriculum practices should honor, reflect, speak from the point of view of, deepen knowledge about, nuance myopic and mundane notions of, and enhance student identity, motivation, interests, and needs, curriculum punishment does the opposite by presenting one-dimensional, under-substantiated, and untruthful narratives and themes of individuals, communities, and nation-states. Tenets that explicate practices that Milner describes through curriculum punishment are (a) Avoiding, (b) Scripting, (c) Narrowing, (d) Distorting, and (e) Banning. Although some of these practices are beyond the control of teachers, teachers are encouraged to Study, Collaborate with others about, Reflect on, Advocate against, and Transform (SCRAT) Curriculum Punishment.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>During summer, children’s activities are dependent on their families’ and communities’ resources, raising concerns about inequalities in access to summer enrichment experiences. In this research brief, we use nationally representative data from the 1999 and 2011 ECLS-K cohorts to examine trends in kindergarten children’s summer enrichment activities over time by socioeconomic status and race. Although we find that persistent inequalities characterize many of these experiences, there were some promising trends, including small shifts upward in summer home academic activities. We discuss implications and future research directions.
