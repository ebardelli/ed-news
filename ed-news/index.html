          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Situated in the context of advanced placement (AP) reform in the United States, we investigated profiles of teachers’ motivation for participating in professional development (PD) courses in a two-cohort sample of nt1 = 2,369 and nt2 = 2,170 chemistry teachers via multilevel latent class analysis. In addition, the study investigated to what extent profile membership was related to factors at the teacher, school, and PD levels. Participation in PD courses was associated with one of three profiles, labeled “reform-motivated,” “convenience-motivated,” and “interaction-motivated.” Participation in PD courses was more likely to be reform-motivated if a teacher had a major in chemistry, more experience teaching AP, more positive attitudes toward PD, or higher enactment of AP redesign in the classroom, or if the PD course was formal and face-to-face. The results show that teachers have different motivations for participating in PD courses and provide insight into how to engage teachers in professional learning.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study answers the following research questions: 1) What types of mathematical errors do future teachers identify when they reflect on their practice? and 2) Which levels of development of the didactic suitability assessment competence for the “errors” component can be inferred when they reflect on their practice? To answer these questions, we explain the Didactic Suitability Criteria construct and describe the associated training cycle structure in the theoretical and methodological framework sections. We followed a qualitative research methodology that mainly consists of thematic analysis. The study conducted allows finding inductive categories of types of mathematical errors, such as error in the task instructions, error of proposition, procedural error, error in the representation, error in the definition and error in the argument. It also enables establishing levels of development of the didactic suitability assessment competence of future teachers for the “errors” component. The main conclusion of this research is the importance of the context to decide what a mathematical error is. The need to further examine the notion of mathematical error in the training of future mathematics teachers is also stressed. Another conclusion is the development of a rubric that allows for more accurate and deeper reflections of future teachers on the errors made.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Gestures are one of the ways in which mathematical cognition is embodied and have been elevated as a potentially important semiotic device in the teaching of mathematics. As such, a better understanding of gestures used during mathematics instruction (including frequency of use, types of gestures, how they are used, and the possible relationship between gestures and student performance) would inform mathematics education. We aim to understand teachers’ gestures in the context of early algebra, particularly in the teaching of the equal sign. Our findings suggest that the equal sign is a relatively rich environment for gestures, which are used in a variety of ways. Participating teachers used gestures frequently to support their teaching about the equal sign. Furthermore, the use of gestures varied depending on the particular conception of the equal sign the instruction aimed to promote. Finally, teacher gesture use in this context is correlated with students’ high performance on an early algebra assessment.</p>

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>Grasping mathematical objects as related to processes is often considered critical for mathematics understanding. Yet, the ontology of mathematical objects remains under debate. In this paper, we theoretically oppose internalist approaches that claim mental entities as the endpoints of process–object transitions and externalist approaches that stress mathematical artifacts—such as physical manipulatives and formulas—as constituting mathematical objects. We search for a view on process–object duality that overcomes the dualism of mind and body. One such approach is commognition that describes mathematical objects as discursive entities. This paper expands the nature of mathematical objects beyond discourse and highlights the role of learners’ interaction with the environment by adopting ecological onto-epistemology. We develop a functional dynamic systems perspective on process–object duality in mathematics learning emphasizing embodied actions and the re-invention of artifacts’ affordances. As a main result, we reconsider process﻿–object duality as a reification of repetitive actions into a cultural artifact that consists of two steps: (1) forming a new sensory-motor coordination that brings new perception to the fore and (2) crystallizing a new artifact in a mathematical environment that captures this new perception. An empirical example from research on embodied action-based design for trigonometry illustrates our theoretical ideas.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>The past two decades have seen the rise of the residency model, another nontraditional pathway to certification that offers an intensive, practice-based, context-specific preparation designed to address shortages in hard-to-staff districts. Although advocates call the model innovative, research examining residencies at scale warrants skepticism around whether they truly offer a distinctive preparation. Surveying all programs across Tennessee about their adoption of features that characterize the model, we find that residencies offer a unique pathway to teaching in some expected ways though not all. Specifically, residencies reported longer clinical placements, more financial support for residents, and higher rates of mentor training, though they mostly did not report unique practices of candidate recruitment, district partnership, mentor selection, or curricular design. Moreover, we see that the distinctiveness of the model is in decline, with evidence of its dilution among newer residencies and the spread of its features among traditional programs.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This article delineates the development of a measure to assess teachers’ reported engagement in practices that center on issues of racial equity as part of their SEL instruction. An iterative mixed-method approach included theoretical grounding, literature reviews, content expert evaluation, focus groups, cognitive interviews, and multiple survey administrations. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted using data from three independent samples of fifth- to eighth-grade teachers (N range = 240–260; White = 67–89%; Black = 3–7%; Latinx = 5–23%). Test-retest reliability was assessed in a fourth national sample from the RAND American Education Panels (N = 482; Black/African American = 19.9%, Latino/Hispanic = 16.2%, Asian/Asian American = 2.7%, American Indian/Native American = 1.9%, White = 66.0%, Middle Eastern/North African = 0.6%, and Other = 2.7%). Results suggest (1) evidence of strong internal consistency for the 41-item Racial Equity-oriented Social Emotional Learning (REQSEL) measure; (2) REQSEL scores correlated with multiple relevant measures of teachers’ beliefs and behaviors regarding race, ethnicity, culture, and social justice; and (3) REQSEL scores correlated with teachers’ own ethnic-racial identity beliefs.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Diagnostic tests are typically administered in a multiple-choice (MC) format due to their advantages of objectivity and time efficiency. The MC-deterministic input, noisy “and” gate (DINA) family of models, a representative class of cognitive diagnostic models for MC items, efficiently and parsimoniously estimates the mastery profiles of examinees. However, the existing models often overestimate the latent traits of examinees when they respond with partial knowledge, which is often observed in educational assessment. Therefore, the novel models of the MC-DINA family that can appropriately handle such responses were developed in this study. Unlike the existing models, the proposed models placed no restrictions on the Q-vector, which represents attribute specifications. Simulation and empirical studies verified that the proposed approach could resolve the overestimation problem.

        <a href='aera open'>Monday, 06. May 2024</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Teachers in early childhood education (ECE) settings are central to providing children with high-quality experiences that promote both early development and long-term well-being; unfortunately, rates of teacher turnover are high in ECE settings. There are strong theoretical reasons to assume turnover is negatively linked with children’s academic and socioemotional development, but few empirical studies test this hypothesis. Using an econometric fixed effects approach in two waves of data from the nationally representative Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey, this study provides the first national estimate of the relationship between within-year lead teacher turnover and children’s development in Head Start. I find an annual within-year turnover rate of ~9%, about twice that of K–12, and that turnover is negatively associated with children’s language outcomes alongside suggestive evidence for behavioral outcomes.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Nationally, more than 75% of individuals who are credentialed to teach are prepared in traditional college- or university-based teacher education programs (TEPs). But the college and employment pathways that prospective teachers take to TEP enrollment and completion have not been comprehensively examined. A better understanding of how credentialed individuals find their way into TEPs helps us understand the sources of new teacher supply early in the prospective teacher pipeline. With that in mind, we analyze pathways into and through TEPs using historical postsecondary and unemployment insurance data from Washington State. We find that the pathways are quite varied, with around 40% of bachelor’s-level TEP completers spending at least some time in community colleges and fewer than 40% enrolling and finishing at the same university directly after high school. Pathways to master’s TEP completion are even more varied, with almost half of the completers having prior employment experience. For researchers, this varied landscape raises important questions about the relationship between pathways, candidate persistence, and eventual job performance. For policymakers, the results suggest that efforts to recruit the next generation of teachers need to look beyond the pool of students already enrolled at a 4-year university to include students at 2-year colleges or in the labor force who might be interested in entering a TEP.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This brief analyzes 4-year graduation rates among students ever classified as English learners (ever-ELs) and those never classified as English learners (never-ELs) at the intersections of gender, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood income. We follow two cohorts of New York City students who entered ninth grade in 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 (N = 127,931). We find substantial variations in 4-year graduation among these subgroups, with differential predicted probabilities depending on the student’s ever-EL status, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood income. These findings reveal important intersectional disparities in this diverse group of ELs—nuances that are lost when analyzing across a single social dimension and that push us to adopt an intersectional lens in quantitative research on ELs.

          Abstract
                  <p>Traditionally, in many countries there exist different teacher education programs for special education and for regular or inclusive education, not at all with similar underlying paradigms for teaching and learning or similar definitions and understanding of the term inclusion. In this context, one central question is how to define inclusive mathematics education, how to address the manifold aspects, and how to reduce discrimination and marginalization. On the one hand, teacher education programs might focus on diverse groups and specific students, like students with special needs and integrate important questions of special education. On the other hand, teacher education programs might take explicitly a broader perspective, considering the mathematical learning of all students and not taking a specific focus. In this contribution we present research results of the project ProViel (‘professionalisation for diversity’) to discuss how a teacher education program can be designed to address both with the underlying paradigm of making mathematics accessible for all students, and what role pre-service teachers’ beliefs as well as their self-efficacy might play. The project aimed at subject-specific concept development and research concerning teacher education for inclusive mathematics on the primary level, considering different points in time within the whole education program. Quantitative data of pre-service teachers’ beliefs and self-efficacy have been analysed, while they participated in different university courses and a practical phase at school. Key findings of this study are, that pre-service teachers’ beliefs about student achievement and their self-efficacy for inclusive mathematics teaching changed during the teacher education program.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper addresses the pressing issues of equity, diversity and inclusion in academic publishing, with a focus on mathematics education research. It highlights systemic biases and barriers that marginalise under-represented voices in the academic discourse. Through an analysis of the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education’s (JMTE) publication patterns, it reveals a significant geographical imbalance and a disparity between the Global North and the Global South, prompting critical reflection on whose voices are prioritised. The paper outlines key initiatives undertaken by JMTE, such as forming an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee, broadening the aims and scope of the journal, developing inclusive reviewing guidelines, and fostering diversity among editors, reviewers and authors. These efforts aim to promote a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive field of mathematics education research by encouraging contributions from under-represented regions and communities and by addressing language barriers and institutional support issues.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Numeracy is important for everyday life. Being numerate has a positive impact on the quality of life of individuals, with positive economic, health, and social outcomes. Despite this, little is known about the role of numeracy in the lives of adults with intellectual disability (ID). Design research has been used to develop ways to support mathematical learning for typically developing students. This study investigates the use of design research to develop context-specific, physical tools to support adults with intellectual disability to improve their numeracy capabilities and engagement in daily tasks. Using observation and interview data, findings demonstrate increased engagement and participation in the numeracy demands of these tasks. Participants reported positive perceptions of improved competence and independence. This study demonstrates the application of design research to the field of numeracy for adults with intellectual disability, and the usefulness of designing context-specific tools to support their numeracy development and independence.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Troubled by the inequities in competitive grantmaking, we use critical quantitative methods to analyze the FY2023 federal academic earmarks as a potential mechanism for racialized change work. Specifically, we ask: To what extent does Congress distribute academic earmarks in ways that reinforce or weaken the racialized stratification of resources across organizations in the field? Accordingly, we identify distribution patterns of academic earmarks, considering the allocation of dollars and types of earmarks (i.e., general capacity-building versus specialized grants) across colleges and universities, between White-serving institutions and minority-serving institutions (MSIs), and among MSIs. Based on our analysis, Congress favored a racially reproductive funding portfolio, driven by smaller and more restrictive allocations, not fewer earmarks. However, the distribution of earmarks among MSIs defied normed expectations, as Congress did not privilege whiter, more prestigious MSIs, signaling the potential of pork-barrel politics for racially reparative work.

          Abstract
                  <p>While numerous studies have investigated teachers’ professional learning through their interaction with resources, the question of how teachers’ knowledge evolves at different stages of the instructional process remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article builds on the documentational approach to didactics (DAD) and the theory of instrumental orchestration to investigate teachers’ professional learning in terms of document development through their interaction with resources in and out of class. To this end, the paper proposes a theoretical and methodological model to analyze the evolution of a document, focusing on the joint evolution of utilization schemes and professional situations. This model provides analytical tools to track the development of teachers’ professional knowledge. The theoretical and methodological model was applied to a case study involving a Tunisian primary school teacher who used the technological resource GeoGebra for the first time to introduce the properties of parallelograms to 6th grade students (aged 11–12). Findings suggest the relevance and operationality of the proposed model,  through a short-term analysis of documentational genesis, to track the evolution of the teacher’s professional knowledge related to the use of GeoGebra in class. This model can be considered as a theoretical and methodological contribution, deepening the understanding of teachers’ professional learning when using technological resources and providing insights into the dynamic nature of teachers’ professional knowledge development.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this article we present topics that can be considered when developing a landscape of investigation that reflects on the issues of the LGBTQ+ community. We outline the landscape LGBTQ+ Life Conditions, having prospective teachers in mind. The outlining takes place in four steps: (1) We indicate the relevance of this topic and bring in real-life complexities into the landscape of investigation to engage the students for doing investigations with mathematics connected to this topic; (2) we present some statistical data that show the relevance of researching the topic and the potentials of mathematics for doing so; (3) we outline some possible investigations when exploring the landscape, taking inspiration from already carried out investigations as well as from some imagined investigations; (4) we reflect on some challenges and possibilities for those who want to explore this landscape in mathematics classes.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study explores variations in prospective teachers’ (PTs’) noticing of students’ mathematical thinking based on narrative writing within the context of a practicum course. The research involved eight PTs, each of whom produced ten weekly narratives throughout the course duration. Most PTs displayed noticing abilities within the average range, with a tendency towards moderate levels, particularly in mixed and focused noticing, as per van Es’s (2011) framework. At the mixed noticing level, PTs predominantly focused on their instructional approaches while also considering learners’ reasoning, albeit with a general perspective. They often made evaluative comments without delving deeply into the specifics that would strengthen their analyses. In contrast, at the focused level of noticing, they dedicated more attention to the specifics of learners’ mathematical reasoning and offered interpretive insights. They cited specific instances and interactions to support their evaluations, demonstrating a more detailed and nuanced engagement with the classroom dynamics. The findings also reveal three distinct profiles of variation in noticing among PTs underscoring the complexity of enhancing noticing skills over time. While profile 1 (average to high levels of noticing) and profile 2 (low to moderate levels of noticing) showed more variation, profile 3 demonstrated a more stable pattern at the moderate levels. These variations might be a result of the bidirectional relationships that exist between the skills of noticing. It could also stem from the events that PTs based their narratives on, affirming that enhancement in noticing is an iterative, context-sensitive process influenced by classroom context and situation awareness.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study is a systematic review of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) studies concerning primary mathematics education published between 2005 and 2022. The aim of the systematic review was to identify the common features of previous TPACK research on primary mathematics education and identify the research gaps based on their contexts. The study used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedure to investigate TPACK-related studies published during the last 17 years in the primary mathematics education domain and to evaluate the characteristics of TPACK instruments used in primary mathematics education. We identified five foci of these studies of TPACK in primary mathematics education research: designing lessons, evaluating mathematics teachers’ knowledge of integrating digital technologies, designing the assessment, evaluating training programs, and informing professional development program designs. Findings from this systematic review of the literature can assist educators in better designing professional development programs to help primary mathematics teachers improve their ability to integrate digital technology into classroom teaching. Also, the findings can assist researchers in locating TPACK instruments that are appropriate and relevant for their research. Finally, we argue that there is a research gap concerning how to measure primary mathematics teachers’ TPACK, how to design a TPACK instrument that includes contextual factors, and how to develop TPACK-oriented teacher training programs for primary mathematics teachers.</p>
