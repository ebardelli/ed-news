          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Teaching coding and computational thinking is an emerging educational imperative, now embedded in compulsory curriculum in the United States, Finland, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia. This meta-synthesis of 49 studies critically reviews recent international research (2009–2022) of coding and computational thinking as core and integrated across the curriculum. It addresses four essential problems: (a) What are the key features of learning environments that successfully develop students’ coding and computational thinking? (b) What is the impact of student engagement in coding and computational thinking on learning outcomes across curriculum areas? (c) What pedagogical constraints are evident for coding and computational thinking, including across curriculum areas? and (d) Which conceptual frameworks support coding and computational thinking, and what has been marginalized or excluded? The review advances knowledge of coding and computational thinking—vital to guide and develop future AI-based solutions to real-world problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We develop a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting teacher shortages at the state, region, district, and school levels. We then empirically examine how teacher shortages vary geographically and by subject using data on unfilled teaching positions in Tennessee traditional public schools during Fall 2019. We find that teacher staffing challenges are highly localized, causing shortages and surpluses to coexist. Aggregate descriptions of staffing challenges mask considerable variation between schools and subjects within districts. Schools with fewer local early-career teachers, smaller district salary increases, worse working conditions, and higher historical attrition rates have higher vacancy rates. Our findings illustrate why viewpoints about, and solutions to, shortages depend critically on whether one takes an aggregate or local perspective.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Drawing on the special issue’s collection of articles, the following commentary examines the racial biases in K-12 and higher education policies and products revealing their seemingly neutral and objective facades to be inherently racialized and, at times, explicitly racist. The article also highlights the damaging effects of race-evasive language in K-12 and higher education, advocating for the prioritization of the most vulnerable students in policy and product design. Rooted in prior research and the author’s experiences as a Latina, a first-generation college student, and a former K -12 educator, the article argues for the abolition of harmful practices like corporal punishment and school resource officers. The author suggests that effective policy design for racial justice may require both mainstream and alternative approaches and highlights successful programs like Freedom Schools and ethnic studies programs. Lastly, the article emphasizes the need for educational policies to reflect a deep understanding of systemic racial inequities and for the research community to directly influence policy design towards equity and inclusion.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>While there is a growing body of literature related to the benefits of participation in career and technical education (CTE) in high school, there remains a dearth of causal work in this area. Relying on administrative data from Baltimore City Public Schools, which uses a ranking system with a strict cut score to assign students into CTE-focused high schools, we employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effects of attending one of these high-quality CTE schools on attendance, career pathway completion, high school GPA, and SAT scores. We find that students who are offered admission to a program within one of the CTE centers are significantly more likely to complete a CTE pathway, though they present significantly lower GPAs. Implications are discussed.

          Abstract
                  <p>As increasing numbers of Black immigrant students attend schools in Chile, we examine classroom practices to consider the limits of the mathematics education equity promise for this student population. We focus on the practices of a third-grade teacher who participated in professional development for enhancing reform-based mathematics teaching in a racially diverse classroom. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s approach to race, our analysis shows how two technologies of race-power fabricate the Black immigrant child as an uneducable and impossible mathematics learner. We contend that rather than enhancing the inclusion of Black immigrant students, reform-based mathematics teaching might maintain and reinforce racial hierarchies of mathematics ability.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In-service primary school teachers’ professional development and, more specifically, their teacher agency, are analyzed regarding the integration of mathematical education and sustainability. To achieve this, based on semi-structured interviews, several questions involving Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and links between mathematics education and sustainability are considered, which yielded 44 answers. The analysis of these answers is based on four sub-aspects: knowledge of sustainability and its connection to the SDGs; sustainability practices; links between mathematics education and sustainability; and obstacles and challenges. The results show that teachers exhibit a significant lack of knowledge about sustainability and its connection to the SDGs, making a single association with issues related to the environmental crisis, which is the main focus of the sustainability practices carried out in schools. As pertains to the links between mathematics education and sustainability, most accept the importance of this connection, but point out various obstacles and challenges, such as the lack of knowledge and time, the curriculum itself, and others. It is concluded that it is necessary to design training programs focused on these aspects, in order to contribute to the development of teacher agency, i.e. the appropriation and reconstruction of new resources to face the challenges that mathematics education for sustainability implies in teaching practice.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Student absenteeism in the earliest years of elementary school has been linked to a range of negative outcomes. Though the literature has examined numerous factors that are associated with children missing school, the role of teachers—especially at the early elementary level—has not been well understood. Given that students spend the majority of their time in elementary school with one teacher in a single classroom, a large component of early elementary school is underexplored, and our understanding of absenteeism remains incomplete. In this vein, we looked into whether having novice versus more experienced teachers was linked to the frequency of student absenteeism in the earliest years of school. Using a national dataset including repeated observations of students in grades K-2, we found that novice teachers have students with fewer absences and a lower probability of being chronically absent. There were no differences in the outcomes of novice teachers as a function of child nor classroom characteristics. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Accountability efforts under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has brought greater attention to school-level processes and practices and their impact on student outcomes. This has pushed states to report more school-level inputs, including per-pupil expenditures. Grounded in an open systems theory (OST) framework, we identify the association between school-level per-pupil spending and academic growth on statewide assessments for seventh graders in Michigan. Overall, our findings suggest an overall positive association between school-level per-pupil expenditure and student growth.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Randomized experiments involving education interventions are typically implemented as cluster randomized trials, with schools serving as clusters. To design such a study, it is critical to understand the degree to which learning outcomes vary between versus within clusters (schools), specifically the intraclass correlation coefficient. It is also helpful to anticipate the benefits, in terms of statistical power, of collecting household data, testing students at baseline, or relying on administrative data on previous cohorts from the same school. We use data from multiple cluster-randomized trials in four Latin American countries to provide information on the intraclass correlations in early grade literacy outcomes. We also describe the proportion of variance explained by different types of covariates. These parameters will help future researchers conduct statistical power analysis, estimate the required sample size, and determine the necessity of collecting different types of baseline data such as child assessments, administrative data at the school level, or household surveys.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State-level postsecondary education governance has experienced a lull in successful reform efforts since the turn of the century. However, in 2020, the Utah System of Higher Education and Utah System of Technical Colleges were formally merged following a multi-year effort by state legislators and higher education officials. Framed by the theory of social construction and policy design, this study considers underlying institutional considerations and statewide goals that led to Utah’s governance merger and how these changes impacted the public higher education sectors in the state, offering insights for research examining higher education governance and reform efforts.

          Abstract  
                  <p>Recent literature underlines the increasing use of online platforms in learning undergraduate mathematics, where students refer to these as supplementary resources to develop their mathematical understanding. Through an intrinsic case study, we focus on a highly viewed YouTube learning resource for learning derivative. The selected case is from 3Blue1Brown, a YouTube channel whose founder has received an award from the American Mathematical Society. The video has garnered more than 3.3 million views in the past couple of years. Reflecting on the relevant literature, a realization tree for derivative is developed and then used as an analytical tool to analyze this resource to explore what realizations have been used in it to facilitate students’ understanding of derivative. The findings indicate that the analyzed YouTube resource discusses various realizations of derivative, including all its five main realizations, and effectively utilizes new digital technology for discussing these realizations. Such an exceptional resource for learning mathematics leads us to suggest that mathematics lecturers raise their awareness about such online free resources and incorporate them into their teaching packages when appropriate to facilitate student learning.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In university mathematics education, students do not simply learn mathematics but are shaped and shape themselves into someone new—mathematicians. In this study, we focus on the becoming of disabled mathematical subjects. We explore the importance of abilities in the processes of being and becoming in university mathematics. Our interest lies in how teaching and assessment practices provide students with ways to understand themselves as both able and disabled, as disabilities are only understood with respect to the norm. We analyse narratives of nine university students diagnosed with learning disabilities or mental health issues to investigate how their subjectivity is constituted in discourse. Our analysis shows how the students are shaped and shape themselves as disabled mathematicians in relation to speed in mathematical activities, disaffection in mathematics, individualism in performing mathematics, and measurability of performance. These findings cast light on the ableist underpinnings of the teaching and assessment practices in university mathematics education. We contend that mathematical ableism forms a watershed for belonging in mathematics learning practices, constituting rather narrow, “normal” ways of being “mathematically able”. We also discuss how our participants challenge and widen the idea of an “able” mathematics student. We pave the way for more inclusive futures of mathematics education by suggesting that rather than understanding the “dis” in disability negatively, the university mathematics education communities may use dis by disrupting order. Perhaps, we ask, if university mathematics fails to enable accessible learning experiences for students who care about mathematics, these practices should indeed be disrupted.</p>
