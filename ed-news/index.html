          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We study the impact of a bonus policy in Hawai‘i Public Schools that raised the salaries of all special education teachers by $10,000. We estimate that this policy reduced the proportion of vacant special education teaching positions relative to general education positions by 32% and the proportion of special education positions that were vacant or filled by an unlicensed teacher by 35%. These impacts were largest in historically hard-to-staff schools in which all teachers received additional bonuses. The policy did not have significant effects on special education teacher retention; instead, the impacts of the policy were driven almost entirely by an increase in the number of general education teachers in the state who moved into open special education teaching positions.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective df as proposed by Satterthwaite, specifically addressing scenarios where component df are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large df, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite’s framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson and Rust, as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants. Finally, the proposed adjustment also provides a correction to the estimate of the total variance in cases missing data have been replaced by multiple imputations such as in the case of plausible values in national and international large scale assessments.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Tuesday, 28. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Several studies highlight teachers’ challenges when posing and analysing modelling problems, often due to the absence of tools supporting these professional tasks. Thus, an important question refers to the effect of implementing different training strategies on the ability of prospective teachers to pose and assess modelling problems. Our study involves a sample of 110 pre-service primary school teachers, divided into three groups. The first group received extensive theoretical and practical teacher training in mathematical modelling based on the proposal of the study and research paths for teacher education. The second group received intensive theoretical training based on a didactic guide outlining the characteristics of modelling problems. The third group, which acts as a reference group, solely relied on the information provided by the Spanish curriculum. All participants undertake the same experience, involving the redesign and analysis of three textbook word problems into modelling problems. The results shed light on teachers’ training needs and the effectiveness of the tools in enhancing their ability to pose and assess modelling tasks at the primary school level.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study provides key empirical evidence of how school principals manage crises, an important but understudied component of their role. Specifically, this paper explores the perspectives of school principals who served as hurricane emergency evacuation shelter managers to understand how they managed the crises that arose during shelter operations and the contextual factors, such as the lack of policies governing shelter management, that facilitated or impeded their ability to succeed in doing so. Our analyses established an ecological framework that blends principals’ managerial knowledge, skills, and training with the larger organizational systems in which crises occurred. Our findings demonstrate the need for improved alignment between the organizations principals serve and what is asked of them as civic leaders during crises.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Interdistrict choice has the potential to exacerbate or alleviate between-district segregation—an increasingly pervasive form of U.S. school segregation—by allowing students to attend schools in districts where they do not reside. Prior research concentrates on the effects of charter schooling on segregation within districts and counties. We used longitudinal enrollment and demographic data from Michigan to examine the impacts of both interdistrict and charter school choice on racial and economic segregation within and between districts in a single setting. We estimated these effects by leveraging between-grade differences in choice use within school systems and years. We confirmed findings from previous research that increases in charter school enrollment increase within-district racial and economic segregation. We also found that the effects of interdistrict choice on both within- and between-district segregation vary with the presence of charter schools.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Gold and stocks, which are conventionally regarded as a safe haven and risk assets, respectively, exhibit complex interrelationships, with significant implications for financial risk management. This paper builds on the sentiment categorization proposed by Liang et al. (2020) to distinguish between private and public sector sentiment. The construction of sentiment indices for both sectors aims to allow the exploration of the heterogeneous effects of these sector-specific sentiments on the gold–stock market linkages in China under different market conditions. The empirical results demonstrate a notable asymmetry in the impact of market sentiment between the public and private sectors, with distinct manifestations in stable versus highly volatile market environments. Specifically, positive sentiment in the public sector tends to diminish the safe-haven function of gold, whereas positive sentiment in the private sector tends to reinforce it. This disparity becomes particularly evident during periods of extreme market volatility. Our findings not only underscore the diverse impacts of market sentiment but also provide novel insights into the importance of incorporating sector-specific sentiment when devising hedging strategies for specific industries.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Monday, 27. January 2025</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Zhu et al. proposed a person-fit method based on the neural network called machine learning person-fit method (MLP-F) and found promising improvements over some traditional methods. MLP-F relies on constructing an appropriate neural network and uses mean square error as a loss function of the neural network. The primary focus of this study is to explore the potential improvement in classifications by replacing mean squared error with cross-entropy. Additionally, the application of MLP-F requires the establishment of a large number of output nodes when dealing with numerous attributes in an exam. However, an excess of nodes in the output layer may diminish classification accuracy and escalate the demand for training data. This article introduces a novel neural network architecture designed to be more versatile and robust. The findings from the research indicate that utilizing a cross-entropy loss function and the new neural network architecture enhances the performance of MLP-F. Simulation studies, considering various aberrant behaviors, demonstrate that MLP-F is effective in identifying aberrant behaviors and particularly excels in shorter tests, showcasing its potential significance in classroom testing.

          Abstract
                  <p>Seriation, sorting and grouping are processes that children begin to use at an early age. These processes, related to classification, become more complex over time—when the nature of the objects to be classified becomes more complex, for example. This article aims to describe and analyze how children aged 3 to 5 years use classification processes. We characterize their mathematical activity by referencing the trio of processes described by Drouard (Drouard, Grand N 86:13–32, 2010)—seriation, sorting, and grouping—and observing which processes the children apply through their actions. The study set up an open-ended task where the children had to create a sorting method while playing “grocery store” by organizing food in the stalls according to their own criteria. The results showed that the children used complex actions, applying grouping and sorting processes. While some had difficulties recognizing and naming the attributes used in their classification system, others showed advanced skills and even created sub-groups.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>One central element in understanding the concept of function and developing functional thinking is the aspect of covariation. Covariation describes how the change in one quantity affects the other one. A lack of students’ understanding of covariation leads to errors and misconceptions. This is particularly evident in students’ interpretations of graphs, where covariation is needed to understand the data. Up to now, it is not sufficiently known how students capture covariation in contextual graphs representing data from real-world phenomena. Our study aims to identify secondary school students’ approaches when capturing change in contextual graphs and students’ use of approaches. In our study, 19 ninth graders were asked to describe the change of two graphs from different situational contexts. To get detailed insights into their process of capturing the change, we triangulated eye-tracking data with verbal protocols and stimulated recall interviews. We identified nine approaches that students used to capture change in contextual graphs, which can be grouped into four main types (pairs of values, section by section, holistically, and total change). Moreover, based on students’ use of approaches in the two tasks, we identified task characteristics that seem to be related to the approach used, such as the situational context and the type of graph. The findings thus mark a first step towards improving the teaching and learning of task-specific graph interpretation.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Increased public scrutiny has thrust school superintendents into the spotlight, possibly exacerbating their turnover. To better understand how superintendent turnover is associated with student achievement, we collected data on school superintendent turnover in Florida and Texas spanning 2009–10 to 2017–18 school years. We conducted an event study difference-in-differences analysis to examine the dynamic relationship between superintendent turnover and student achievement. Student achievement decreases in the years after a superintendent turns over, though this relationship is small in magnitude (−0.015 standard deviation units). Superintendent turnover is most detrimental in urban school districts, districts enrolling more students, and districts with more concentrated student poverty, though these negative relationships can be partially explained by instability in the district that led to the superintendent’s departure.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>As education researchers continue to investigate policies at scale and across diverse contexts, scholars must develop a better understanding of mechanisms shaping policy effects. In this study, we use the case of a federal initiative allowing high school students to use the Pell Grant for dual enrollment to investigate how institutions’ capacities shaped policy efficacy. We find that colleges’ capacities for policy implementation depended on their pre-existing resources (“foundational capacity”), the resources to execute the policy given policy-induced constraints (“execution capacity”), and the resources to provide the target population with access to the policy (“provision capacity”). We contend that institutions that may benefit the most from equitable policies also have the least capacity to implement them.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>In recent years, debates surrounding instruction related to Critical Race Theory (CRT) have proliferated across the United States, flamed by political actors and media pundits who ushered a heretofore largely academic concentration into the public sphere. In this study, we examine opinions of voters and parents of school-aged children regarding racism-related instruction in Missouri, a locus of anti-CRT legislative debate. We find that though voters and parents are less likely to support allowing CRT-related instruction in schools, both groups support the permissibility of institutional and systemic racism-focused instruction, despite overlap between the two curricular emphases. Conversely, voter preferences are predicted much more strongly by political ideology than are parent preferences. Together, these findings question the role of anti-CRT legislative aims.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>States and colleges nationwide are adopting corequisite reforms, where students concurrently enroll in developmental and college-level coursework. Leveraging the concept of collective sensemaking and interviews with 54 actors at 16 community colleges implementing a statewide corequisite mandate, we examine the policy signals actors received, how personnel in different roles interacted to create an implementation plan, and how institutional supports and constraints shaped collective responses to policy. We find that actors within the same institutions—and even the same position—received different types of policy signals, often shaped by gatekeeping behavior among administrators over which actors should inhabit core implementation roles. Actors with peripheral roles were detached from the early deliberation of policy signals, minimizing their influence over implementation.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We evaluate the effects of an online self-assessment tool on teachers’ competencies and beliefs about information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education. The causal impact of the tool is evaluated through a randomized encouragement design involving 7,391 lower secondary teachers across 11 European countries. Short-run impact estimates show that the use of the tool led teachers to critically revise their technology-enhanced teaching competencies (−0.14 standard deviations [SD]) and their beliefs about the use of ICT in education (−0.35 SD), while no impact on teachers’ ICT training is found. The effects are concentrated among teachers in the top-end tail of the distribution of pre-treatment outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence that the feedback score provided by the tool triggered such results by providing a negative information shock.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study presents an instructional model that integrates research-based practices from the fields of mathematics education and special education to support the development of students’ reasoning and examines how the reasoning of the participants, 30 students with mathematical learning difficulties (ages 10 to 12 years), evolves over time. Nineteen of the students were from urban public schools and 11 were from a private school for students with learning differences in the Southwest USA; eight of the students had a special education diagnosis, and the other 22 students had no diagnosis. The model, which emphasises shared student thinking in a small-group setting and instructional decisions in response to that thinking, was implemented in the context of fraction comparisons. Descriptive and inferential analyses of correctness and completeness of student reasoning on a pre- and post-test measure as well as formative measures incorporated throughout instruction indicated significant findings with respect to growth in student reasoning. The study has implications for future research when considering how to support the development of mathematical reasoning within the population of students who struggle in mathematics.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The foremost index of caregiving quality is child attachment, as supported by attachment theory. Research supports the relevance of early parenting interventions in improving child outcomes in attachment quality to promote public health because of their long-term effects on mental health and functioning. This study aimed at evaluating the impact on both parenting and child outcomes of the Parent–Child Psychological Support Programme® (PCPS), a community-based program individually tailored to parents and their infants during periodic center-based visits to promote attachment security. The evaluation involved two cohorts from “vulnerable populations” and used the resources embedded in the program design without interfering with the normal functioning of the service. From an evaluative research approach, the effects on mothers and children were assessed using a quantitative approach. Pre- and post-test measures (parenting questionnaires) and child attachment quality assessments through the Strange Situation Procedure were examined. The equivalence of the cohorts was verified and used as a baseline for parenting outcomes. PCPS participants demonstrated increased parental competence and self-efficacy, as well as reduced levels of parenting stress. Analysis of the two cohorts showed a significant difference in the number of visits and proxies for intervention, which were associated with the expected pre–post changes in parenting dimensions. The proportion of securely attached children was significantly higher in the “medium-high intervention” group than in the “no/low intervention” group (72.7% vs 54.5%). Furthermore, compared with international baselines, this proportion showed no differences in the “no-/low-intervention” group but demonstrated expected significant differences in the “medium-high intervention” group.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>The increasingly partisan politics of education make it vital to conceptualize why and to empirically assess how current partisan pressures threaten public schools’ efforts to educate toward a diverse democracy. We examine these dynamics, drawing on a survey of a large and diverse sample of high school principals, weighted to reflect national demographics, conducted in summer 2022. We find that high schools in purple contexts are particularly likely to experience parent and community pushback related to education toward a diverse democracy and that schools in purple and red communities are less likely to provide support for this priority. By mapping this terrain, the study informs our understanding of the new partisan politics of education, priorities for future research, and, ultimately, directions for strategic action on the part of key stakeholders.

          Abstract
                  <p>Although considerable research has been conducted on mathematical modelling and mathematical creativity separately, relatively few studies have explored their intersection. This study builds on the framework established by Lu and Kaiser to conceptualise creativity in mathematical modelling. In the paper an elaborated model of creativity that is unique to mathematical modelling is presented and appropriate assessment methods are developed. Creativity is redefined in this context and a new method for measuring it is proposed. The method extends the previously identified elements of creativity for mathematical modelling and includes an empirical test to assess creativity in mathematical modelling. In the study 141 pre-service mathematics teachers from two types of teacher education institutes in China were assessed on their creativity performance in mathematical modelling using the newly developed scoring system. Statistical analysis revealed significant findings: preservice mathematics teachers showed different levels of creativity in different modelling tasks, and significant differences in creativity were observed between the groups from two different institutes. These findings enrich the understanding of how creativity manifests itself in mathematical modelling. They also highlight the importance of developing pedagogical strategies to foster and assess creative competencies in future mathematics teachers.</p>
