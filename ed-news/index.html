          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The narrative woven throughout this article elevates the persistence, perseverance, resilience, and resolve of a neighborhood anchored in faith, and fiercely devoted to its children. Contextualized through its rich history of mobilization for social justice, this story uplifts and defends the cultural wealth of a historically marginalized community as an imperative element of children’s education and as a critical cognizance for those aspiring to become teachers. An exemplar in self-determinism, the narrative, elevates how neighbors’ voice and vision propel innovation in the dynamics of university/community collaboration. Ultimately, the article challenges traditional power structures, offering a compelling and justifiable direction for the field of educator preparation.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper examines the relationship between subject specialization in high school and university undergraduate degree program choices. Focusing on a reform in England that encouraged students to opt for studying mathematics in the last 2 years of high school, the study analyzes its effect on undergraduate enrollment in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The findings indicate that the reform increased the likelihood of students pursuing and completing STEM undergraduate degrees. Thus, encouraging mathematics specialization during high school enhances the number of STEM graduates. However, despite the reform’s implementation, gender and socioeconomic disparities in STEM participation remained unchanged, suggesting that interventions during adolescence might not effectively address the underrepresentation of specific groups, such as females, in STEM programs.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 301-328, June 2024. <br>Multivariate meta-analysis is used to synthesize estimates of multiple quantities (“effect sizes”), such as risk factors or treatment effects, accounting for correlation and typically also heterogeneity. In the most general case, estimation can be intractable if data are sparse (for example, many risk factors but few studies) because the number of model parameters that must be estimated scales quadratically with the number of effect sizes. This article presents a new command, smvmeta, that makes estimation tractable by modeling correlation and heterogeneity in a low-dimensional space via random projection. This reduces the number of model parameters to be linear in the number of effect sizes. smvmeta is demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 23 risk factors for pain after total knee arthroplasty. Validation experiments show that, compared with meta-regression (a reasonable alternative model that could be used when data are sparse), smvmeta can provide substantially more precise estimates (that is, narrower confidence intervals) at little cost in bias.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/loi/stja?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R'>Thursday, 25. July 2024</a> | 
        
          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 185-212, June 2024. <br>Instrumental-variables estimation is an approach commonly used to evaluate the effect of a program in case of noncompliance. However, when the binary treatment status is misreported, standard techniques are not sufficient to point identify and consistently estimate the effect of interest. We present a new command, ivbounds, that implements three partial identification strategies developed by Tommasi and Zhang (2024, Journal of Econometrics 238: 105556) to bound the heterogeneous treatment effect when both noncompliance and misreporting of treatment status are present. We illustrate the use of the command by reassessing the benefits of participating in the 401(k) pension plan on savings in the United States.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 213-249, June 2024. <br>In this article, we describe the package twostep, a bundle of programs to perform analyses of hierarchical data applying the two-step approach. We consider a two-level data setup in which “microlevel” units are nested within “macrolevel” units. One-step models (which can be fit using, for example, mixed) are the most common approach to modeling two-level data. The two-step approach is an alternative in which parameters associated with microlevel and macrolevel predictors are estimated separately for each level. It can be used as an alternative to one-step models if the estimand is a cross-level interaction. We also show how the two-step approach usefully complements one-step approaches by providing exploratory data analysis, descriptive graphs, and regression diagnostics.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 250-272, June 2024. <br>In this article, we describe the mixrandregret command, which extends the randregret command introduced in Gutiérrez-Vargas, Meulders, and Vandebroek (2021, Stata Journal 21: 626–658) by allowing random coefficients in random regret minimization models. The newly developed mixrandregret command allows the user to specify a combination of fixed and random coefficients in the regret function of the classical random regret minimization model introduced in Chorus (2010, European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research 10: 181–196). In addition, the user can specify normal and lognormal distributions for the random coefficients using the appropriate command’s options. The models are fit by maximum simulated likelihood estimation using numerical integration to approximate the choice probabilities.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 329-361, June 2024. <br>Membership of overlapping or intersecting sets may be recorded in a bundle of (0, 1) indicator variables. Annotated Euler or Venn diagrams may be used to show graphically the frequencies of subsets so defined, but beyond just a few sets such diagrams can be hard to draw and use effectively. This column presents two new commands for graphical alternatives: upsetplot and vennbar. Each command produces a bar chart by default, but there is scope to recast to different graphical forms. The differences between the new commands reflect the divide in Stata between twoway commands and other graph commands. They also provide some flexibility in graph design to match tastes and circumstances. The discussion includes many historical details and references.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 2, Page 273-286, June 2024. <br>In this article, we develop a first-stage linear regression command, fsivqreg, for an instrumental-variables quantile regression (QR) model. The quantile first stage is analogous to the least-squares case, that is, a linear projection of the endogenous variables on the instruments and other exogenous covariates, with the difference that the QR case is a weighted projection. The weights are given by the conditional density function of the innovation term in the QR structural model, at a given quantile. An empirical application illustrates its implementation.

It has been used in a variety of contexts, including sports or supply and demand imbalances in shared transportation. Stata does not support the Skellam distribution or Skellam regression. We present a command, skellamreg, to estimate the parameters of a Skellam distribution and Skellam regression model using Mata’s optimize function.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article used a rich longitudinal data set from four school districts in California to study absenteeism patterns among students classified as an English learner (EL). We looked at absence patterns overall and disaggregated by EL classification, grade level, and pre/post COVID-19. When their demographic and school-level factors are considered, ELs have fewer absences and are less likely to be chronically absent than non-EL students. This finding is evident for all EL classified groups, although the differences in absenteeism for long-term EL (LTEL) and newcomer EL students are markedly smaller than for other EL subgroups. The negative absenteeism patterns for ELs shifted after the COVID-19 pandemic. EL-classified students experienced higher absenteeism rates during the pandemic even when holding other factors constant. This rising absenteeism trend is most evident for current ELs and LTELs.

          Abstract
                  <p>The old canard that Indigenous and First Nations peoples had, or have, only rudimentary mathematical skills has been curiously persistent, against widespread published evidence over the past century and a half. In Australia, attempts to include Indigenous mathematical knowledge in curriculums have encountered strong resistance. After more than 12 years of advocacy and development by expert Indigenous advisers, content elaborations on Indigenous mathematics were included in the 2022 release of the Australian school curriculum. This hard-won achievement is welcomed widely, but experience also tells us to expect some resistance from sectors of the education communities who maintain and gatekeep an exclusively British-European or Western provenance of mathematics. In this article, we employ an exemplary approach to counter such narratives by summarising and replying to five published critiques of Indigenous mathematics, which typify widely held and propagated misconceptions. We seek to forestall potential pushback constructively, and address concerns regarding the legitimacy and pedagogical value of Indigenous mathematics, by countering with evidence claims in these critiques that Australian First Nations peoples historically had no autonomously developed mathematical knowledge. In doing so, we seek to stimulate more diverse and inclusive discussions of the underlying questions of ‘What is mathematics?’ and ‘Who can do mathematics?’. Although our research originated in a particular national context, the foundational importance of mathematics within and between all societies entails a global response to address these and similar pervasive misconceptions.</p>
