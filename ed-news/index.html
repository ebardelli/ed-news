          Abstract
                  <p>This paper examines how different approaches in mathematics education conceptualise the relationship between school mathematics and university mathematics. The approaches considered here include: (a) Klein’s elementary mathematics from a higher standpoint; (b) Shulman’s transformation of disciplinary subject matter into subject matter for teaching; and (c) Chevallard’s didactic transposition of scholarly knowledge into knowledge to be taught. Similarities and contrasts between these three approaches are discussed in terms of how they frame the relationship between the academic discipline and the school subject, and to what extent they problematise the reliance and bias towards the academic discipline. The institutional position implicit in the three approaches is then examined in order to open up new ways of thinking about the relationship between school mathematics and university mathematics.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we draw on our recent research to inspect again some of the theoretical perspectives we have been using to analyze data and to characterize teaching-learning in university settings. We focus particularly, within a sociocultural perspective on Activity Theory and the construct the “Teaching Triad,” seeking to embed the Triad within an Activity Theory perspective. To achieve this, we relate the Teaching Triad with aspects of the sociocultural setting both in and beyond direct interactions in face-to-face teaching. While this is mainly a theoretical paper, an example is taken from observations of teaching in university lectures in a Greek university to show how these theoretical perspectives have provided insights to the institutional and cultural complexities involved and in what ways the Triad construct has evolved.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Although Black and Latinx students disproportionately face exclusionary school discipline, prior research finds that the likelihood of suspension for Black students decreases when they are taught by greater proportions of Black teachers. Little prior work, however, has examined whether these effects generalize to large, diverse, urban school districts or to Asian American or Latinx students and teachers. Using student fixed-effects models and 10 years of data from New York City, we find that assignment to greater proportions of ethnoracially matched teachers decreases the likelihood of suspension for Black and Latinx students. The magnitudes of these effects are small but suggest that diversifying the teacher workforce could lead to significant decreases in exclusionary discipline in urban districts.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>School districts are traditionally subject to a variety of state regulations on educational inputs. Absent regulations, policymakers fear that districts will make inappropriate decisions. However, it is also possible that regulations hinder schools from optimizing student learning. This article tests the salience of these hypotheses by estimating the impact of the Texas District of Innovation statute, which allows districts to opt out of regulations on inputs like teacher certification and class sizes. Using web-scraped implementation data, I document widespread exemptions and variation in regulatory preferences. However, staggered difference-in-differences analyses demonstrate a limited impact of deregulation within 4 years, suggesting that deregulation alone is a relatively weak lever for spurring innovation and changing the state of education.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>As school board meetings are integral sites of local education policymaking, scholars must consider how structural racism manifests in these spaces across various district contexts. We examine how racialized institutional logics undergird the interactions between majority-Black district leadership and a local Black community during school board meetings. Through an ethnographic case study of school board meetings over the 2019–2020 school year, we find that racialized pressures led predominantly Black school board members and district administrators to uphold policies and practices that limited two-way authentic interactions with their Black constituents. In conclusion, we argue that racial representation in educational politics may be important, but is not sufficient unless accompanied by changes to policies and practices that privilege Whiteness and reproduce racism.

          Abstract
                  <p>To successfully solve the complex challenges facing us in the 21st century, people with expertise in the science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) fields and other fields are needed, especially for their interdisciplinary way of thinking and working. These competencies should be learned in school, which first implies teacher education to that effect. In this article, a detailed theoretical reflection on the connections or overlapping areas between STEAM education and the dimension of sustainability in a model-like way is presented. It is also argued that mathematical modelling can be a possible instrument for promoting pre-service teachers’ professionalism in STEAM education and education for sustainable development (ESD). Based on authors’ developed model of this theoretical framework, an ESD-modelling seminar was created for pre-service mathematics teachers in which they also worked on that ESD and STEAM-based modelling problems. In the written reflections on the seminar, which were used as the survey instrument within the conducted empirical study, the teachers presented their subjective views on the connection between modelling and ESD. Based on an evaluation of these written reports by type-forming qualitative content analysis, three teacher profiles for handling ESD within mathematical modelling were developed. These types of teachers illustrate a strong awareness of promoting STEAM and ESD through modelling activities in their upcoming teacher life.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The use of the algebraic method for solving word problems is a challenging topic for secondary school students. Students’ difficulties are usually associated with extracting the problem’s network of relationships between quantities and with formalizing these relationships into algebraic language in a problem model. Both sources can coexist and interact; thus, it is usually not possible to determine which source of difficulty is more relevant. In addition, there are specific errors, such as the error by multiple referents for the unknown, which are directly linked to the wording of the problem text, and in which the same two sources of error coexist. In this work, we present the results of an experiment conducted with 255 secondary school students assessing the effect of two common difficulties on the accuracy of problem models and on the rate of multiple referents for the unknown. The first difficulty is the use of algebraic language in the construction of the problem model; the second is the use of the same expression to designate different quantities within the problem text. We used a 2 × 2 between-between design, with one factor related to the symbolic language (algebraic or arithmetic) in which the problem model is constructed, and the other factor related to the actual language features of the text problem. Our results indicate that overall, the main source of difficulty for students is the use of algebraic language to formalize a problem model, representing a large effect size.</p>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>We use Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory to study students’ geometric understanding of partial derivatives of functions of two variables. This study contributes to research on the teaching and learning of differential multivariable calculus and its didactics. This is an important area due to its multiple applications in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM). The study tests a previously proposed model of mental constructions students may use to understand partial derivatives through a set of activities designed to help students make the conjectured constructions. The model is based on the local linearity of differentiable two-variable functions, and the model-based activities explore the relationship between partial derivatives and tangent plane in different representations. We used semi-structured interviews with eleven students whose teacher used the three-part cycle—Activities designed with the genetic decomposition; collaborative work in small groups and Class discussion; and Exercises for home (ACE)—as pedagogical strategy. The model-based activity set based on local linearity and the ACE strategy helped students construct a geometric understanding of partial derivatives. Results led to reconsider and further refine the model. This study also resulted in improving activity sets and obtaining information on students’ construction of second-order and mixed partial derivatives.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This report describes initial findings from a larger study conducted in the USA focusing on mathematics teacher preparation and beginning teacher practice as they relate to equity. We particularly address in this report a gap in the literature with respect to pre-service teachers’ conceptions of equity and equitable practice as they relate to issues of identity and power at the end of their teacher education programs. Interviews of 33 students near the completion of their teacher education programs were analyzed using Gutiérrez’s four dimensions of equity—access, achievement, identity, and power. Our findings suggest that these pre-service teachers had ways of thinking about these domains that were both varied and nuanced, with many students describing critical aspects of equitable instruction including attention to bias, representation, student participation, and classroom power structures. Our findings are consistent with prior research in that future teachers described many ideas related to equitable teacher practice that focused on access to mathematics, and, in many cases, deficit perspectives persisted. At the same time, our study suggests that beginning teachers may complete their education programs with critical knowledge around equity that could provide fertile ground for further professional learning.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Despite lagging behind other high-income countries, the United States has made slow but steady improvements in health, especially for children from low-income households, through a series of health policies and programs since the 1990s. Have these health benefits spilled over to educational attainment and achievement? In this article, we systematically review the causal impact of various health policies and programs on children’s educational outcomes in the United States. We find that several health policies and programs aimed at improving the physical health of children and parents have modest spillover effects on key educational outcomes for school-age children. On the other hand, there is a paucity of research on policies aimed at improving children and adolescents’ mental health (and limited evidence on their efficacy on educational outcomes where research exists). We contextualize the effects of these health policies by providing benchmarks from other education policies and conclude with some key open questions and suggestions that can guide research and policymaking at the health-education nexus.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Teacher accountability reforms implemented around the globe have heightened a sense that teachers are losing the support of policymakers and the general public. To examine the global pattern in teachers’ perception of occupational value and identify possible outcomes and predictors, we analyzed the 2018 Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) data. We found an overwhelming majority of teachers feel undervalued in almost all OECD countries. In addition, teachers who feel undervalued reported less collective teacher effort for school improvement and job dissatisfaction consistently in four countries of comparison with different policy contexts—the United States, Australia, Finland, and Korea. However, the relationships between three working conditions impacted by accountability reforms—compensation, classroom autonomy, and involvement in school decision-making—and perceived occupational value varied across these four countries. Specifically, these working conditions seem to matter more in the United States, where the teacher policy context produces greater disparities across schools in teacher qualifications, distribution of qualified teachers, and degree of professional control.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Equity-centered preparation builds novice teachers’ capacity to make meaningful instruction accessible to all students, particularly those historically excluded from high-quality learning experiences. Drawing on social learning theory, we examined Teacher Study Groups as a model for supporting preservice special educators’ development of equity-centered practices. We examined 60 preservice teachers’ instruction prior to and following study group participation, embedded in a fieldwork support course, alongside related artifacts shared during weekly sessions. Using a convergent mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative and qualitative data separately and then integrated findings using joint display analysis; in doing so, we generated meta-inferences regarding how teachers’ attitudes mediated growth in practice. We uncovered salient participatory experiences that influenced—and hindered—professional growth. Our findings have implications for programs interested in structuring professional learning in a manner that builds foundations for an equity-centered practice.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>In this article, we analyze student survey data related to sense of belonging and relationships with teachers and adults within and across the fastest growing subgroup of K–12 public school students: students classified as English learners (ELs). Students classified as ELs in our study, overall, felt a similar sense of belonging, or slightly higher sense of belonging than their never and formerly EL-classified peers; however, within the sense of belonging constructs, students classified as ELs varied in their perceptions of school climate. Additionally, current EL-classified students who took the survey in English were more positive than those who took the survey in another language; however, once student demographics and school contexts were held constant, survey language was weakly related to our outcome measures. We conclude by discussing how our findings can guide K–12 education policies, practices, and research to foster inclusive educational environments.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Although the generalized deterministic inputs, noisy “and” gate model (G-DINA; de la Torre, 2011) is a general cognitive diagnosis model (CDM), it does not account for the heterogeneity that is rooted from the existing latent groups in the population of examinees. To address this, this study proposes the mixture G-DINA model, a CDM that incorporates the G-DINA model within the finite mixture modeling framework. An expectation–maximization algorithm is developed to estimate the mixture G-DINA model. To determine the viability of the proposed model, an extensive simulation study is conducted to examine the parameter recovery performance, model fit, and correct classification rates. Responses to a reading comprehension assessment were analyzed to further demonstrate the capability of the proposed model.

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper reviews research on equity in mathematics education (excluding gender equity) for the period 2017–2022. From the publications identified, five themes were distilled: conceptualizations and framing of equity in mathematics education; research methodologies and researcher positionalities; equity-focused practices, pedagogies and teacher education; equitable mathematics curriculum content, access and pathways; and equity in mathematics education at system levels, nationally and internationally. The review concludes by engaging some of the critique and suggests future directions for research. The research demonstrates that there is growing voice and visibility of equity-focused studies in mathematics education and that conceptualizations of equity have broadened and deepened through an increasing diversity of studies in this area. At the same time, the review also shows the dominance of the Global North in shaping equity discourses and the paucity of research on equity in mathematics education from the Global South.</p>

Historically, these different forms of knowledge were taught separately in teacher preparation and left to the preservice teacher to integrate on their own. This raises the question; what resources can be leveraged to promote knowledge integration in mathematics courses for teachers? In this study, we identified six instructional actions that were associated with potential knowledge integration when implemented within the environment of a mathematics course for preservice teachers. We posit these instructional actions can be implemented in concise and minimally invasive ways in a variety of mathematics content courses.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Although charter schools are frequently afforded flexibility from many state laws that govern traditional public schools, a growing number of charter school teachers have now unionized and introduced collective bargaining to the charter sector. Using data from a detailed content analysis of teacher CBAs from California, we compare the restrictiveness of CBAs in 75 unionized charter bargaining units to the restrictiveness of CBAs in 31 nearest neighbor traditional public school district bargaining units. We find that independent charter CBAs are much more flexible than the CBAs of traditional public school districts, but charter school CBAs of bargaining units combined with traditional public school districts are comparably restrictive.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>There is a renewed focus on what constitutes a well-rounded education, as well as a growing interest in broader indicators of educational success, including social and emotional development and school engagement. However, identifying educational practices that improve such outcomes has proven elusive. We explore the role of arts education on a broad range of educational outcomes using administrative and survey data from Boston’s public schools. We find that students receiving the arts in school attend more, are more engaged, and their parents and teachers are more likely to participate and be engaged at school, with larger effects for students with individualized education plans, students with lower standardized test scores, and students with a history of chronic absenteeism. These findings call attention to the pivotal role of the arts in providing students with socially and emotionally supportive learning environments that enhance relationships between students and schools.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers’ sensemaking of student behavior determines whether students get in trouble and are formally disciplined. Status categories, such as race, can influence perceptions of student culpability, but the degree to which teachers’ initial identification of student misbehavior exacerbates racial disproportionality in discipline receipt is unknown. This study provides the first systematic documentation of teachers’ use of office discipline referrals (ODRs) in a large, diverse urban school district in California that specifies the identity of both the referred and referring individuals in all ODRs. We identify teachers exhibiting extensive referring behavior, or the top 5% referrers, based on the number of ODRs they make in a given year and evaluate their contributions to disciplinary disparities. We find that “top referrers” effectively double the racial gaps in ODRs for both Black-White and Hispanic-White comparisons. These gaps are mainly driven by higher numbers of ODRs issued for Black and Hispanic students due to interpersonal offences and defiance and also partially convert to racial gaps in suspensions. Both the level and racial compositions of the school sites where top referrers serve and their personal traits seem to explain some of their frequent referring behavior. Targeting supports and interventions to top referrers might afford an important opportunity to reduce racial disciplinary gaps.

          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Recently, numerous news stories have detailed the ways teachers across the country have been disciplined for addressing issues of oppression and justice in their schools. This paper engages poststructural discourse analysis to consider data from a year-long study of recent graduates of a justice-oriented teacher education program during their first year teaching, examining the ways that stories of community backlash functioned to discipline early career teachers to behave in particular ways. I theorize that these stories serve to discourage teachers from pursuing justice-oriented work in the classroom and that such discourses must be addressed in teacher education programs to prepare preservice teachers for the political realities of entering classrooms in the United States in the current cultural moment.
