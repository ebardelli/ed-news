          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>At schools with low grading standards, students receive higher school-awarded grades across multiple courses than students with the same skills receive at schools with high grading standards. I show school grading standards vary substantially, enough to affect post-secondary opportunities, across high schools in Alberta, Canada. Schools with low grading standards are more likely to be private, rural, offer courses for students returning to high school after dropping out, have smaller course cohorts, have a smaller percentage of lone-parent households, and have a larger percentage of well-educated parents. The article makes a useful methodological contribution in clarifying the assumptions needed to estimate and interpret a measure of grading standards from course-year-school observations of average school-awarded grades and average external examination grades.

          Abstract
                  <p>In the boxplot, the box always represents – regardless of its area – the middle half of the data and thus a measure of variability (interquartile range). However, when students first learn about boxplots, they are usual already familiar with other forms of statistical representations (e.g., bar or circle graphs) in which a larger area represents a higher frequency of observations. If students erroneously apply this well-established area-represents-frequency schema to boxplots, it results in a systematic error which we describe as the consequence of an incomplete conceptual change. We empirically validated difficulty-generating characteristics that allow the differentiation between item types with varying complexity (item level) and aimed to identify profiles (person level) that differ depending on which schema was used in which item type. For this purpose, we conducted two cross-sectional studies with N = 100 university students (study 1) and N = 297 participants who finished secondary school or higher (study 2) and used generalized linear mixed models (item level) and k-means clustering with predefined cluster centers (person level) to test our hypotheses. We could replicate the systematic error that was described in previous research and found new difficulty-generating characteristics in boxplot items. Our results support the notion of different profiles potentially emerging based on varying degrees of conceptual change. From an instructional perspective, information about individual progress in conceptual change could be considered for tailoring individualized interventions.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Today, various non-governmental organizations proclaim the need for public engagement of citizens, a concept that is integrated into the notion of global citizenship. However, much of the mathematics that students find in the primary school curriculum falls short to support that need. This lack of curriculum alignment with global needs has implications for the development of communities, but they are much more severe for students from underserved populations who systematically suffer different types of exclusions that increase their social disadvantages. This study explores the traits of global citizenship that students from underserved populations exhibit as they progress through a learning experience with open civic data on a global issue (climate change). The learning experience was used as the basis for an individual interview with five participants (9–10 years old) from public schools in low-income neighborhoods of a metropolitan area in northern Colombia. Participants were offered a dataset (data) ready to use and they were asked to undertake data handling actions (data-ing) using freely available web-based software. Participants were asked “What does this dataset say?” and their verbal statements were analyzed. The main findings suggest that in data and data-ing on open civic data reflecting global issues, participants exhibited understanding, belonging and action which are traits of global citizenship. In terms of understanding, participants described the behavior of the variables, suggested informal inferences, and made associations between variables. In terms of belonging and action, participants’ statements suggested including themselves as part of the community, taking responsibility, and proposing transformative actions.</p>

      </h3>

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>State education agencies have increasing influence over educational policy and practice, with responsibilities ranging from vision setting to monitoring compliance with accountability policy. Although state education agency leaders are well positioned to advance change, capacity building at this level of the education system has been traditionally limited. Research–practice partnerships (RPPs) represent a promising venue to support the ability of state leaders to facilitate educational change. In this qualitative study, we drew on semistructured interviews with state education agency leaders and observations of RPP meetings to examine the state-level structures that pose challenges to leaders’ efforts to make change and how participating in an RPP can support leaders in addressing these challenges. Findings reveal how RPP engagement supported state leaders with navigating complex organizational silos and bureaucratic processes by promoting relationship building and supporting the use of evidence-based resources. These insights may inform future research and capacity-building efforts at the state level of the education system.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Saturday, 08. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The use of metacognitive strategies when working on modelling problems in small groups is assumed to lead to goal-oriented and effective processing of the problems. Based on the analysis of eight group processes of grade 9 students working on a modelling problem, this article takes a detailed look at the initiation of metacognitive behaviour by individual students in the group process. For this purpose, videos were coded using a deductive category system in accordance with structuring qualitative content analysis, which was enriched inductively. As a result, the metacognitive strategies initiated by individual students were classified according to two criteria: the time of occurrence (during or between modelling phases) and if they relate to the content of task processing and to the behaviour of group members. Furthermore, seven aims were identified, three of which were related to different areas of metacognitive strategies, and four of which arose from the level of collaborative and socioemotional engagement in the groups. Additionally, the latter could be linked to the extent to which the groups worked together cooperatively or collaboratively and to the extent to which the individual members were included and valued in the work process.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>It has been established that, in Bayesian tasks, performance and typical errors in reading information from filled visualizations depend both on the type of the provided visualization and information format. However, apart from reading visualizations, students should also be able to create visualizations on their own and successfully use them as heuristic tools in modeling tasks. In this paper, we first want to broaden the view on Bayesian reasoning to probabilistic tasks with two binary events in general and embed the whole process of solving these tasks using probabilistic visualizations in a modified modeling framework. Thereby, it becomes apparent that most of the steps remained untouched by existing research. Second, in the present empirical study, we focused on one part of the largely unexplored creation process and examined entering statistical information into empty visualizations as heuristic tools. N = 172 participants had to enter conditional and joint probabilities or the corresponding frequencies into empty visualizations in a paper-and-pencil test. We analyze (a) students’ performance when entering information in visualizations and (b) typical errors, both dependent on the information format (probabilities vs. natural frequencies), which empty visualization structure (2⨯2 table, double tree, net diagram) was provided, and type of information (conditional vs. joint information). The well-known positive effect of natural frequencies on participants’ performance was evident when entering conditional information into 2⨯2 tables and net diagrams. However, with respect to joint information, no superior effect of frequencies was observed. Furthermore, the theoretical implementation of our research in a modeling cycle allows us to identify desiderata for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Critical events are incidents encountered by teachers in their practice that can potentially provoke questions about the instructional decisions made, gaining an entry to changing and improving teaching practices. Current research often conceptualises critical events as those that occur during instruction, but critical events can also occur before and after instruction, especially in the contexts of lesson study. In this paper, I will unpack the notion of a critical reflection event during the study, plan, and reflect phases of lesson study through three vignettes that happened during a lesson study cycle. This paper examines how lesson study positions teachers to notice critical reflection events that can provoke pedagogical reasoning and action for the purpose of gaining new comprehension.</p>

      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Wednesday, 05. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>This study explores secondary-school mathematics teachers’ noticing of Critical Events Associated with Argumentation (CEAs), moments when students’ reasoning or interactions become evident, offering teachers opportunities to promote argumentation in the classroom. Thirty-one teachers analyzed a written classroom scenario, identifying CEAs, interpreting their potential for fostering argumentation, and proposing teaching alternatives. The findings reveal that teachers identified CEAs emphasizing either mathematical arguments, collaborative interactions in constructing and evaluating arguments, or both, with a primary focus on dialogic interactions. The identified CEAs, along with their interpretations and proposed strategies, demonstrated alignment, by focusing on common underlying aspects. The dynamic interconnection among components of noticing—attending, interpreting, and responding—challenges linear models, suggesting iterative and holistic processes. By framing CEAs as opportunities to integrate structural and dialogic aspects of argumentation, this study contributes to refining noticing frameworks and advancing teachers' professional development. Theoretical and practical implications for research on noticing and argumentation in mathematics education are discussed, alongside recommendations for future studies.</p>

                  <p>In this cultural-comparative study, we examined the recommendations for instructional modifications made by 12 Czech and 12 non-Czech mathematics teacher educators (MTEs). The non-Czech MTEs were selected from countries culturally distinct from Czechia, including Costa Rica, Japan, Kosovo, Türkiye, the UK, and the USA, with two MTEs from each country. The participants were invited to provide written feedback on a part of a video lesson (teaching segment) in which a Czech elementary mathematics teacher handled student errors. The results demonstrated that the Czech MTEs emphasized individual learning and content, while the non-Czech MTEs’ feedback was more diverse, advocating a more collaborative and reflective learning environment. Drawing on the limitations of our study, implications for future research are provided.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this essay, we explored the feasibility of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for qualitative data analysis in equity-focused research. Specifically, we compare thematic analyses of interview transcripts conducted by human coders with those performed by GPT-3 using a zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting strategy. Our results suggest that the AI model, when provided with suitable prompts, can proficiently perform thematic analysis, demonstrating considerable comparability with human coders. Despite potential biases inherent in its training data, the model was able to analyze and interpret the data through social justice perspectives. We discuss the applications of integrating AI into qualitative research, provide code snippets illustrating the use of GPT models, and highlight unresolved questions to encourage further dialogue in the field.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher turnover is a persistent policy concern in public education. Researchers have documented negative impacts of turnover on student outcomes; yet we know little about the causal mechanisms by which turnover influences, or disrupts, schools’ efforts to improve. In our longitudinal qualitative study, we examined how turnover affects relationships, trust, and shared knowledge in organizations—that is, organizational social capital—in ways that can impede school improvement efforts. We found that teacher turnover depletes organizational social capital by disrupting networks and relationships between teachers working in teams, weakening shared meanings and goals in schools, and impeding teachers’ ability to collectively engage in problem-solving and learning. We illuminate the hidden ways in which instability undermines improvement efforts and strains organizations.

          Abstract
                  <p>Academic emotions play a crucial role in mathematics learning, significantly influencing motivation, academic achievement, and career aspirations in mathematics. With the notable increase in research on emotions in recent years, our review uses Pekrun’s control-value theory with two primary objectives: to systematically describe the characteristics of emotions in recent research through a systematic review, and to synthesize evidence on the relationships between specific emotions, control-value antecedents, and mathematics achievement via a meta-analysis. The systematic review of 112 studies revealed that more than 100 specific emotions have been addressed in recent research, which we analyzed based on key emotion characteristics: valence and activation, type of object, temporal stability, and social context. The findings from the systematic review provide an overview of mathematics-specific objects that emotions have referred to in the most recent research. The subsequent meta-analysis demonstrated that mathematics achievement (e.g., test scores and grades) was positively related to enjoyment, hope, and pride (

                  <p>Mathematics teacher education is now a well-established field of research, but it is only in recent years that research attention has turned towards the learning and development of mathematics teacher educators themselves. In this special issue, interest centres on mathematics teacher educator expertise and how this can be represented, developed, and studied. The research studies published in this issue aim to move beyond category-based descriptions of mathematics teacher educator knowledge and explore the broader complexity of expertise as blend of knowing, doing, believing, and being. In doing so they capture the dynamic and interconnected nature of expertise. In this commentary article, I reflect on what we can learn from these studies about the complexity of MTE expertise and use these insights to suggest directions for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Communities of practice (CoPs) that support the teaching and learning of mathematics in Canada are discussed. In particular, why CoPs are needed for mathematics instruction in Canadian universities, as well as some examples of these CoPs and what they offer, their target audience, and how they benefit mathematics education. CoP examples aimed to reach nationwide include the Canadian Mathematics Society, Canadian Mathematics Education Study Group, and First Year Mathematics and Statistics in Canada. There are also examples of regional and institutional-specific CoPs, such as the Fields Math Ed Forums located in Toronto and online, that are discussed. We conclude with some comparisons of these CoPs and what may lie ahead for CoPs and their impact on university mathematics instructors in Canada.</p>
