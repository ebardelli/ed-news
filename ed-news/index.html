          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>With an educational issue that has caught the attention of many countries in the world (study load), a population of 8th graders from a typical Chinese metropolitan city (40,536 from 118 schools), and an advanced statistical strategy (multilevel piecewise regression), we examined whether there was a turning point in terms of the effects of study load on science achievement. We did identify a turning point for each and every measure of study load. For weekday learning on science achievement, we identified a turning point of 22.50 hr for the effects of in-school learning, 7.50 hr for the effects of homework, and 12 hr for the effects of after-school learning. For weekend learning on science achievement, we identified a turning point of 1.50 hr for the effects of in-school learning, 5 hr for the effects of homework, and 1 hr for the effects of after-school learning. In each case, the difference in effects before and after the turning point was statistically significant, indicating that the effects of study load on science achievement were nonlinear. All of these turning points offered important implications for science education.

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Many U.S. schools utilize grade retention (repeating grades when not meeting academic benchmarks) to allow more time for students to learn grade level material. However, some research suggests retention may increase inequalities and not help students progress. We use national data (Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study 2014–2017) and logistic regression to examine what predicts the likelihood of elementary school retention and whether retention is associated with long term outcomes. We find that race and family income did not predict who was most likely to be retained. As expected, boys were more likely to be retained than girls. Most importantly, we show that, of students in major metropolitan areas, retention did not predict long-term academic outcomes (regardless of race, sex, or familial income). Retention did predict long-term exclusionary discipline outcomes for Black students only supporting the School to Prison Pipeline framework.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>This study used bibliographic data from Web of Science and employed various bibliometric analysis tools to present a systematic review of ethical leadership research from a board perspective. Theoretical evolutions underpinning how ethical leaders influence their followers are also detailed. Results identify the key documents, frequent keywords, and the most used theories in the field of ethical leadership. Results show that not only are there few newcomers to the field, the knowledge on ethical leadership, dominated by a minority few, has not diffused to a broader community. Results also show that although the focus of ethical leadership research in recent years shifted to employee creativity and knowledge sharing, the theories applied in the investigations remain the dominant social exchange theory and social learning theory. The results provide useful references for future studies, avoiding repetitive research while identifying possible knowledge gaps.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In a randomized trial that collects text as an outcome, traditional approaches for assessing treatment impact require that each document first be manually coded for constructs of interest by human raters. An impact analysis can then be conducted to compare treatment and control groups, using the hand-coded scores as a measured outcome. This process is both time and labor-intensive, which creates a persistent barrier for large-scale assessments of text. Furthermore, enriching one’s understanding of a found impact on text outcomes via secondary analyses can be difficult without additional scoring efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide a pipeline for using machine-based text analytic and data mining tools to augment traditional text-based impact analysis by analyzing impacts across an array of automatically generated text features. In this way, we can explore what an overall impact signifies in terms of how the text has evolved due to treatment. Through a case study based on a recent field trial in education, we show that machine learning can indeed enrich experimental evaluations of text by providing a more comprehensive and fine-grained picture of the mechanisms that lead to stronger argumentative writing in a first- and second-grade content literacy intervention. Relying exclusively on human scoring, by contrast, is a lost opportunity. Overall, the workflow and analytical strategy we describe can serve as a template for researchers interested in performing their own experimental evaluations of text.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Thursday, 09. November 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Statistical and data literacy have emerged as key competencies in the 21st-century. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula have been adapted in various countries to place increased emphasis on proficient data use and statistical comprehension. Consequently, there is a need for an adequate education and professional training of STEM teachers. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes research on teachers’ statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education. A total of 42 articles were analyzed, with a specific focus on teacher variables, teacher education, and their impact on classroom practice. The findings emphasize the recent emergence of research in this domain, particularly focusing on statistical literacy, with mathematics being the dominant STEM domain explored. Most studies examined cognitive variables of both pre-service and in-service teachers, revealing relevant gaps in knowledge and skills related to statistical and data literacy. Limited attention was given to teachers’ affective variables. Research on the complex relationships between teacher variables, their teaching practices, and their students’ learning is scarce, necessitating further investigation. Several pedagogical approaches to prepare STEM teachers for promoting statistical and data literacy in their classrooms were identified. Positive impacts on teachers’ cognitive and affective variables were observed, but longitudinal effects and transfer to classroom practice require further inquiry. As curricula worldwide increasingly emphasize statistical and data literacy, this review underscores the necessity of enhancing teachers' competencies, advocates for tailored pedagogical approaches, and emphasizes the need for further research to shape effective instruction in K-12 STEM education.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='aera open'>Wednesday, 08. November 2023</a> | 
        
          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Research has shown that mathematical proficiency gaps are related to students’ and schools’ indicators of poverty, with fewer studies on neighborhood effects on achievement gaps. Although this literature has accounted for students’ nesting within schools, so far, methodological constraints have not allowed researchers to formally account for multilevel and spatial effects. I contribute to this discussion by simultaneously considering test-takers’ own socioeconomic standing and the impact of their nesting schools and neighborhood structures. Multilevel simultaneous autoregressive (MSAR) models and population-level data of 2.09 million test-takers, whose standardized performances were measured at Grades 3–8 in New York State, revealed the presence of geography of mathematical (dis)advantage. Because mathematical performance is spatially dependent across schools and neighborhoods, moving forward, applied researchers should rely on MSAR to account for sources of spatially driven bias that cannot be handled with multilevel models alone. Full replication code and data are provided at cutt.ly/N4zRstL.

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The Brown decision represents a watershed moment in U.S. history as the remedy served as a guiding light during a pandemic. A pandemic is an epidemic taking place on a scale that spans the globe. A circumstance is not a pandemic merely because it exists in different regions of the world or results in the death of many people; it must also be infectious. For centuries, by way of mutually reinforcing regimes consisting of politicians, intellectuals, religious supporters, business leaders, and others, an ideology of racial biology “infected” the world, causing a disease to spread in global fashion. The disease fed on a rhetoric that assigned biological superiority to certain races. A resulting pandemic of segregation occurred. In the United States, the Brown decision offered hope as a therapeutic. This lecture examines Brown through the lens of a medical model while exploring its various pervasive effects on society and education.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The digital economy, which boasts general technology, intense penetration, platform ecology, and low marginal cost, is a product of advanced digital technology. This new engine has become a driving force for high-quality economic development. From the three aspects of development momentum, efficiency, and structure, this paper profoundly explores internal mechanisms to lead the high-quality growth of the regional economy. By constructing an econometric model, the influence effect and means of the digital economy on the high-quality development of the regional economy are empirically tested. The digital economy and its three sub-dimensions can significantly promote the high-quality development of the regional economy. However, industrial digitalization has the most vital role in promoting it. The digital economy has shown a more vital promotion role in the central and western regions and provinces with low total factor productivity, and it can indirectly impact high-quality economic development by promoting dynamic, efficient, and structural changes.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>A test battery with two different levels of adaptation is presented: a within-subtest level for the selection of the items in the subtests and a between-subtest level to move from one subtest to the next. The battery runs on a two-level model consisting of a regular response model for each of the subtests extended with a second level for the joint distribution of their abilities. The presentation of the model is followed by an optimized MCMC algorithm to update the posterior distribution of each of its ability parameters, select the items to Bayesian optimality, and adaptively move from one subtest to the next. Thanks to extremely rapid convergence of the Markov chain and simple posterior calculations, the algorithm can be used in real-world applications without any noticeable latency. Finally, an empirical study with a battery of short diagnostic subtests is shown to yield score accuracies close to traditional one-level adaptive testing with subtests of double lengths.
