          Abstract
                  <p>Special tasks for pre-service teachers (PSTs) in university mathematics courses (“interface tasks”) are a common innovation in recent years to overcome the second discontinuity. By this, we mean tasks that are situated by typical everyday challenges of mathematics teaching and in which PSTs must use their mathematical knowledge and skills in a professionally relevant way. In this paper, we analyze answers that PSTs have created to an interface task on symmetry. The PSTs were asked to clarify a student’s question from a mathematical perspective and then give a suitable elementarized answer. We situate these two steps theoretically and reconstruct the mathematical reasoning in PSTs' answers. Through qualitative content analysis, we examined how PSTs justify figures' symmetries from a university mathematics perspective and when responding to the fictitious student. The scenario of a student questioning the existence of 100° rotationally symmetrical figures elicited rich and varied responses, proving suitable for an interface task. We compared PSTs' reasoning related to mathematical clarification with the reasoning related to elementarization. In many cases, this revealed a productive use of course content. An interesting result is that there is no uniform picture as to whether the arguments are more detailed in the mathematical clarification or in the elementarization.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This study examines the impact of an online math learning program on third through fifth grade math achievement in Louisiana. Employing Zearn Math usage metrics and administrative data from the Louisiana Department of Education, the results indicate that grade levels that programmatically used Zearn Math scored, on average, about .03 standard deviation units higher on Louisiana’s statewide math assessment. A placebo test using English-language arts scores and several robustness checks suggests that this may be an underestimate of the true effect. These findings come at a crucial time because pandemic-related school closures have led to a 20-fold increase in public school spending on Zearn-related materials between July 2019 and July 2021, and its presence continues to expand across the nation.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 8-14, September 2024. <br>Adults’ beliefs and knowledge about the state of the U.S. education system drive decisions about policy, funding, program adoption, student participation in programs, and the selection of decision makers to elected positions. Amie Rapaport and Anna Rosefsky Saavedra share national survey data showing that U.S. adults have little knowledge about what is being taught in schools, express neutrality about belief systems undergirding education policy, and report experiences misaligned with hard-data trends on student academic progress in recent years. With adults reporting they learn about issues crucial to our education system mainly from “personal experience,” better information has the potential to improve U.S. education.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 38-43, September 2024. <br>The latest content and practice standards for mathematics have promoted the use of academic language and discourse in this content area. As such, the WIDA Consortium has evolved its guidelines to deepen teachers’ conceptual understanding of language in their content areas, and thus, enable them to provide more effective instruction to multilingual learners. Karen L. Terrell explores one of the primary “key language uses” in mathematics — the narrative genre. She also considers how visuals can be powerful scaffolds and means of expression for multilingual learners and discusses how visuals can be used for students to both receive and express knowledge. The use of narrative and visuals can make mathematics more accessible to all students.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 44-48, September 2024. <br>In response to the growing awareness of trauma and its impact on student learning, schools across the country are implementing trauma-sensitive practices. Authors Maia Cucchiara and Mary Beth Hays describe an approach to trauma sensitivity in schools: the creation of restoration rooms, spaces designed to help students (and adults) return to a state of regulation. Restoration rooms are not for disciplining students. Instead, they are spaces equipped with fidget toys, soft carpets and cushions, flexible seating, and other materials to promote regulation. Schools can use these spaces as part of larger efforts to respond to student and staff trauma and promote overall wellness.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 1, Page 15-18, September 2024. <br>PDK polls consistently show that parents give their children’s schools high marks but are dissatisfied with the performance of public schools nationally. This paradox may be explained by the persistent narrative of failing public schools that has dominated media coverage in the past 50 years. Authors Mark Hlavacik and Jack Schneider tracked the prevalence of the failing-schools narrative in print publications, books, and other media. They found connections between national coverage of education and local education reporting. This national narrative of failing schools uses public schools as a scapegoat, which absolves us of our collective responsibility to each other. A more nuanced and multifaceted narrative of public schools is needed.
