          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The cross-classified data structure is ubiquitous in education, psychology, and health outcome sciences. In these areas, assessment instruments that are made up of multiple items are frequently used to measure latent constructs. The presence of both the cross-classified structure and multivariate categorical outcomes leads to the so-called item-level data with cross-classified structure. An example of such data structure is the routinely collected student evaluation of teaching (SET) data. Motivated by the lack of research on multilevel IRT modeling with crossed random effects and the need of an approach that can properly handle SET data, this study proposed a cross-classified IRT model, which takes into account both the cross-classified data structure and properties of multiple items in an assessment instrument. A new variant of the Metropolis–Hastings Robbins–Monro (MH-RM) algorithm was introduced to address the computational complexities in estimating the proposed model. A preliminary simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm for fitting the proposed model to data. The results indicated that model parameters were well recovered. The proposed model was also applied to SET data collected at a large public university to answer empirical research questions. Limitations and future research directions were discussed.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper describes a process evaluation of a ‘wise’ intervention that took place in six acute care units in two medical-surgical teaching hospitals in the United States during 2016–2017. ‘Wise’ interventions are short, inexpensive interventions that depend on triggering specific psychological mechanisms to achieve behaviour change. This study sought to increase the hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates before entering a patient’s room among nurses. The intervention centred on the use of threat to professional identity to prompt improved HHC. Through questionnaires administered to intervention participants and the implementation facilitator, together with independent observation of intervention delivery, we examined whether the steps in the Theory of Change occurred as expected. We found that aspects of the implementation—including mode of delivery, use of incentives, and how nurses were recruited and complied with the intervention—affected reach and likely effectiveness. While components of the intervention’s mechanisms of impact—such as the element of surprise—were successful, they ultimately did not translate into performance of the target behaviour. Performance was also not affected by use of an implementation intention as repeated performance of HHC over years of being a nurse has likely already established well-ingrained practices. Context did have an effect; the safety culture of the units, the involvement of the Nurse Managers, the level of accountability for HHC in each unit, and the hospitals themselves all influenced levels of engagement. These conclusions should have implications for those interested in the applicability of ‘wise’ interventions and those seeking to improve HHC in hospitals.

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Limited research on diabetes education and support implementation in Appalachia, which is a critical knowledge gap considering barriers to care, and high prevalence rates. The aim was to understand what each facility is providing regarding diabetes education and services within West Virginia. This study reports cognitive interview qualitative findings from a multi-methods study. Individuals were recruited through an online search to identify clinics, organizations, and hospital staff that provided diabetes education in the state of West Virginia. Eligible participants were individuals who facilitated and managed diabetes education and support in counties of West Virginia. The interviews followed an 11-item interview guide, approved, and reviewed by a practicing Registered Dietitian and Certified Diabetes Care Education Specialist in West Virginia. All qualitative data from the interviews were hand-coded using grounded theory, by two researchers. 15 participating organizations from the state of West Virginia were included and described three phenomena: Diabetes Education Implementation (differences in: evaluation measures, modality, delivery format, topical areas); Barriers to Care (staffing, lack of training, evaluation, loss of research partnerships and funding); and Facilitators to Care (community-based involvement, interdisciplinary collaboration, capacity building (trainings). There are concerns with program drift and “risky” adaptations such as inconsistent evaluative measures, lack of training for program facilitators, variety of delivery formats, and content material. Findings recommend more alignment in program delivery to better implementation. Further studies should assess patient experiences with implemented diabetes education programs in West Virginia to further support the current research findings.

          Abstract
                  <p>Advocacy of STEM curricular approaches is based on a concern to engage students in authentic disciplinary and interdisciplinary practices in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) disciplines, and the need to promote participation in STEM pathways. The STEM Academy professional learning program was developed to support teachers to engage and motivate students by creating real-world, challenging problems. The initiative involved interdisciplinary teams of secondary STEM teachers attending workshops and working with university experts to design, implement and evaluate STEM curricular experiences. This paper focuses on case studies undertaken in two of the twelve schools involved in the initiative, using interview data from teachers and students, to explore the nature of their programs and their experiences. We investigate key features of these two schools’ approaches, using a conceptual framework for integrated STEM, and explore the challenges and benefits of different features of integrated STEM that promote different dimensions of engagement in learning mathematics. We explore how the framework characteristics can be reframed into four dimensions that promote mathematics engagement in integrated STEM education - design thinking in authentic contexts, content integration, STEM practices and 21st Century skills, and exposure to professional practice.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this conceptual paper, the author argues that equity research in mathematics education is a genre that operates according to certain implicit ideological and rhetorical rules and assumptions—or discursive formations—that form how one can think about equity and inequity. One such rule that forms the basis of this paper is the axiom of racialized deviance, a logical tool developed by whiteness to establish its dominance and to justify physical, psychic, and epistemic violence against blackness. The author takes up whiteness and blackness related to global systems of racialization beyond the reference to white and Black people that is more typical in the United States. The author proposes three ways that the deviance axiom shows up in equity research in mathematics education: ethnomathematics, repair orientations, and success counternarratives. This issue of racialized deviance unveils equity research in mathematics education as a project whose logical foundations undermine its stated aims. The logic of global white supremacy under which school mathematics operates creates a situation where it is impossible for equity in mathematics education to exist outside because the genre requires that anyone who elects to participate accepts the axiom of racialized deviance on some level.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>To improve one of the lowest rates of literacy and numeracy in the world, the government of Brazil has targeted public education reform, given the strong link between an educated population and economic growth. This study examines the academic performance of the Brazilian public primary school system. It addresses the empirical shortcomings of prior research to examine the dynamics of the relationship between academic performance scores and several demographic and institutional variables, such as socioeconomic characteristics, variations in school infrastructure and school complexity, and teachers’ human capital. We employed quantile regression to explore the determinants of academic performance across 35,490 schools in rural and urban environments in Brazil. The dependent variable in our analysis captures the academic performance score, as measured by Brazil’s education authorities, of each school in our dataset. The model includes several education-related indices used in prior research and, as explanatory factors, measures of teachers’ human capital and the students’ socioeconomic level, which synthesizes information on parents’ education and household income. The results suggest that several institutional variables, including access to school libraries, computer facilities, projectors, and televisions, are positively and significantly related to the academic performance of primary students in Brazil’s system of public education. Furthermore, students’ socioeconomic level is positively associated with their academic performance.

          AERA Open, Volume 9, Issue , January-December 2023. <br>Canadian middle and high school students (N = 2,278) completed a “CTRL-F” curriculum teaching them how to evaluate online information by reading laterally to investigate sources, check claims, and trace information to original contexts. A subset of CTRL-F students (N = 316) were in classes with teacher-matched control groups (N = 287). Some CTRL-F students (N = 994) completed a delayed posttest. At pretest, students indicated preference for some lateral reading strategies, but preference rarely translated into use. Following instruction, CTRL-F students showed greater preference for and use of lateral reading than controls and greater alignment between preference and use. The curriculum’s impact varied by demographic factors but not by differences in implementation. Gains were maintained from posttest to delayed posttest. Direct instruction and practice in lateral reading appear to strengthen connections between students’ preferences and utilization of these strategies to evaluate online content relevant to academic and personal life.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>We investigate the predictive validity of teacher licensure tests using data from the Massachusetts Tests for Educator Licensure (MTEL). MTEL scores predict teachers’ in-service performance ratings and contributions to student test scores (i.e., value added). We then explore whether these relationships vary for teacher candidates of color. Although candidates of color have lower first-time pass rates and are less likely to retake licensure tests, we do not find consistent evidence that MTEL scores are less predictive of student achievement gains. Finally, we find that some evidence that MTEL scores are more predictive of teacher performance ratings for teachers of color than for White teachers.

          Abstract 
                    <p>Noticing the strengths in students’ mathematical thinking is a critical skill that teachers need to develop, but it can be challenging due to the prevalence of deficit-based thinking in mathematics education. To address this challenge, a teacher education course was designed to encourage prospective teachers to engage in critical reflection on their own and others’ framings of students’ thinking and shift their focus towards noticing students’ strengths. The study analyzed written responses from the prospective teachers, collected at the beginning and end of the course, to investigate their framing and noticing of students’ mathematical thinking. The analysis focused on the aspects of students’ thinking that the prospective teachers paid attention to, the stances they took when interpreting students’ thinking, and the instructional moves they proposed in response to their thinking. Furthermore, the study established a spectrum of deficit-based and strength-based framings on students’ mathematical thinking. This spectrum allowed for the identification of each participant’s written noticing responses within a range of possibilities, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the changes in teachers’ framing and noticing of students’ thinking over time.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Learning to interpret data in context is an important educational outcome. To assess students’ attainment of this outcome, it is necessary to examine the interplay between their contextual and statistical reasoning. We describe a research method designed to do so. The method draws upon Toulmin’s (1958, 2003) model of argumentation for the first stage of qualitative data analysis and the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) (Biggs &amp; Collis, 1991) model for the second stage. Toulmin analyses help identify the justifications and expressions of uncertainty students provide in their interpretive arguments. Subsequent analyses based on the multi-modal conceptualization of SOLO help characterize the quality of student arguments relative to one another. Existing literature and an empirical example are drawn upon to explain how the Toulmin and SOLO models can be used in tandem to analyze students’ interpretations of contextualized data. We also explain how pairing Toulmin and SOLO can address theoretical and practical limitations that arise when using just one of the two models on its own.</p>

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Spiritual care is increasingly seen as a task of all health care professionals. This is challenging for chaplains working in health care, who hold spiritual care at the heart of their profession but don’t feel rooted in a strong professional identity. In this article we discuss a participatory action research that aimed at strengthening the professional identity of health care chaplains by forming collaborative learning communities of chaplains and general practice mental health. The focus is on the ‘boundary work’ and how participatory action research contributes to this. Relational professionalism, Dialogical Self Theory and Boundary Theory are combined to interpret the complex relational-dialogical processes of negotiating one’s identity within the relationships with diverse others: clients, mental health nurses and society. The result is a more articulated and at the same time flexible professional identity for healthcare chaplains. Participatory action research contributes to these boundary processes by stimulating reflection, explicating, eliciting or encouraging different voices and facilitating the dialogue between these professionals.

          Abstract
                  <p>Explaining is a vital spontaneous process for human beings, as through explanations we make sense of the surrounding phenomena. While the role and structure of explanations have been explored in each science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) area, little is still known regarding what counts as a good explanation for a STEM problem. This study seeks to address this void by examining the nature of 82 explanations of a STEM challenge produced by 9th grade students (years 14–16) who participated in a learning sequence designed with an integrated STEM education perspective (I-STEM). We aim to find out which types of explanations are produced by 9th grade students when engaged in an I-STEM learning sequence, as a strategy to establish/identify the core features of a good I-STEM explanation. As a subsidiary aim, we intend to propose an analytical framework that enables the characterization and understanding of the students’ explanations to an integrated STEM problem, based on the combination of a theoretical view on I-STEM explanations and the qualitative analysis of explanations produced by students. Results show that a majority of the students produced STEM explanations, either descriptive or relational, that failed to demonstrate knowledge or procedures from the four STEM areas. About a quarter of the solutions entailed I-STEM explanations, thus recognizing the role of knowledge or procedures of each area, concurring to obtain the solution, from the creation of the artefact to the understanding of the underlying law. We further propose a conceptualization of a good I-STEM explanation as involving the mobilization of conceptual knowledge and processes from all STEM areas in an explicit and intentional way to present the solution devised to the STEM challenge.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>We propose a new item response theory growth model with item-specific learning parameters, or ISLP, and two variations of this model. In the ISLP model, either items or blocks of items have their own learning parameters. This model may be used to improve the efficiency of learning in a formative assessment. We show ways that the ISLP model’s learning parameters can be estimated in simulation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), demonstrate a way that the model could be used in the context of adaptive item selection to increase the rate of learning, and estimate the learning parameters in an empirical data analysis using the ISLP. In the simulation studies, the one-parameter logistic model was used as the measurement model to generate random response data with various test lengths and sample sizes. Ability growth was modeled with a few variations of the ISLP model, and it was verified that the parameters were accurately recovered. Secondly, we generated data using the linear logistic test model with known Q-matrix structure for the item difficulties. Using a two-step procedure gave very comparable results for the estimation of the learning parameters even when item difficulties were unknown. The potential benefit of using an adaptive selection method in conjunction with the ISLP model was shown by comparing total improvement in the examinees’ ability parameter to two other methods of item selection that do not utilize this growth model. If the ISLP holds, adaptive item selection consistently led to larger improvements over the other methods. A real data application of the ISLP was given to illustrate its use in a spatial reasoning study designed to promote learning. In this study, interventions were given after each block of ten items to increase ability. Learning parameters were estimated using MCMC.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>In this critical, political discourse analysis, we trace how two concepts, equity and quality, became discursively linked and contested in the administration of postsecondary education policy over time (1968–1994)—a developmental process we refer to as (e)quality politics. By engaging in a historical analysis, we investigate (a) the racialized political origins and discursive processes by which arguments over educational “quality” are advanced as part of an antiequity policy paradigm and (b) how this paradigm reinscribes racial inequity into administrative and organizational action over time. We illustrate how, once an (e)quality politics paradigm is established, racialized policy designs can persist, even in the absence of explicit references to racialized social constructions of target populations in later periods of policy development.
