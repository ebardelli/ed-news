          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We evaluate the effects of an online self-assessment tool on teachers’ competencies and beliefs about information and communication technologies (ICTs) in education. The causal impact of the tool is evaluated through a randomized encouragement design involving 7,391 lower secondary teachers across 11 European countries. Short-run impact estimates show that the use of the tool led teachers to critically revise their technology-enhanced teaching competencies (−0.14 standard deviations [SD]) and their beliefs about the use of ICT in education (−0.35 SD), while no impact on teachers’ ICT training is found. The effects are concentrated among teachers in the top-end tail of the distribution of pre-treatment outcomes. We provide suggestive evidence that the feedback score provided by the tool triggered such results by providing a negative information shock.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study presents an instructional model that integrates research-based practices from the fields of mathematics education and special education to support the development of students’ reasoning and examines how the reasoning of the participants, 30 students with mathematical learning difficulties (ages 10 to 12 years), evolves over time. Nineteen of the students were from urban public schools and 11 were from a private school for students with learning differences in the Southwest USA; eight of the students had a special education diagnosis, and the other 22 students had no diagnosis. The model, which emphasises shared student thinking in a small-group setting and instructional decisions in response to that thinking, was implemented in the context of fraction comparisons. Descriptive and inferential analyses of correctness and completeness of student reasoning on a pre- and post-test measure as well as formative measures incorporated throughout instruction indicated significant findings with respect to growth in student reasoning. The study has implications for future research when considering how to support the development of mathematical reasoning within the population of students who struggle in mathematics.</p>

          Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The foremost index of caregiving quality is child attachment, as supported by attachment theory. Research supports the relevance of early parenting interventions in improving child outcomes in attachment quality to promote public health because of their long-term effects on mental health and functioning. This study aimed at evaluating the impact on both parenting and child outcomes of the Parent–Child Psychological Support Programme® (PCPS), a community-based program individually tailored to parents and their infants during periodic center-based visits to promote attachment security. The evaluation involved two cohorts from “vulnerable populations” and used the resources embedded in the program design without interfering with the normal functioning of the service. From an evaluative research approach, the effects on mothers and children were assessed using a quantitative approach. Pre- and post-test measures (parenting questionnaires) and child attachment quality assessments through the Strange Situation Procedure were examined. The equivalence of the cohorts was verified and used as a baseline for parenting outcomes. PCPS participants demonstrated increased parental competence and self-efficacy, as well as reduced levels of parenting stress. Analysis of the two cohorts showed a significant difference in the number of visits and proxies for intervention, which were associated with the expected pre–post changes in parenting dimensions. The proportion of securely attached children was significantly higher in the “medium-high intervention” group than in the “no/low intervention” group (72.7% vs 54.5%). Furthermore, compared with international baselines, this proportion showed no differences in the “no-/low-intervention” group but demonstrated expected significant differences in the “medium-high intervention” group.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>The increasingly partisan politics of education make it vital to conceptualize why and to empirically assess how current partisan pressures threaten public schools’ efforts to educate toward a diverse democracy. We examine these dynamics, drawing on a survey of a large and diverse sample of high school principals, weighted to reflect national demographics, conducted in summer 2022. We find that high schools in purple contexts are particularly likely to experience parent and community pushback related to education toward a diverse democracy and that schools in purple and red communities are less likely to provide support for this priority. By mapping this terrain, the study informs our understanding of the new partisan politics of education, priorities for future research, and, ultimately, directions for strategic action on the part of key stakeholders.

          Abstract
                  <p>Although considerable research has been conducted on mathematical modelling and mathematical creativity separately, relatively few studies have explored their intersection. This study builds on the framework established by Lu and Kaiser to conceptualise creativity in mathematical modelling. In the paper an elaborated model of creativity that is unique to mathematical modelling is presented and appropriate assessment methods are developed. Creativity is redefined in this context and a new method for measuring it is proposed. The method extends the previously identified elements of creativity for mathematical modelling and includes an empirical test to assess creativity in mathematical modelling. In the study 141 pre-service mathematics teachers from two types of teacher education institutes in China were assessed on their creativity performance in mathematical modelling using the newly developed scoring system. Statistical analysis revealed significant findings: preservice mathematics teachers showed different levels of creativity in different modelling tasks, and significant differences in creativity were observed between the groups from two different institutes. These findings enrich the understanding of how creativity manifests itself in mathematical modelling. They also highlight the importance of developing pedagogical strategies to foster and assess creative competencies in future mathematics teachers.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>We examined the relationships between student content-specific grouping and the attributes of teachers-students’ interactions during online collaborative mathematical task solving using a learning analytics tool for automatic formative assessment. Such technology offloads some teachers’ responsibilities regarding mathematical aspects of learning, and we therefore ask, what are the characteristics of teachers’ interactions with students in this context? How do these characteristics relate to content-specific grouping? We examined teachers’ interactions with 29 pairs of 10th-grade students in distance group mathematics learning in a technological environment on the subject of the quadratic function. Students were teamed according to their work on a preliminary task in one of the following ways: encompassing, mutual, or similar. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of teachers’ interactions with students and interviews were conducted. We identified four categories of teacher actions that characterize dialog facilitation: task comprehension, technology use, mathematics content, and interpersonal interactions. The findings showed that teachers initiated more inferences than students in the interpersonal and task comprehension categories, while there was no significant difference between the initiators of the other categories. Furthermore, teachers and students initiated interpersonal interactions significantly more when groups were grouped with unbalanced relationships (encompassing, commonly known as heterogeneous grouping). These findings shed light on the potential to foster nuanced abilities of mathematics teachers to facilitate group work.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Statistics and machine learning are critical because they play an essential role in our everyday lives and the careers we may pursue in the future. It may be beneficial to introduce machine learning, such as decision trees (DTs), at an early stage of education. The data-based construction of DTs is an example of a machine learning process, which can be addressed in mathematics or statistics teaching because of relatively low prior knowledge requirements. This paper focuses on investigating how sixth-grade students create and evaluate data-based DTs. The basis is a teaching unit that aims to lay the foundation for machine learning and enhance students’ understanding of the process. We investigate students’ processes in detail while they build DTs with data cards about food items to predict whether a new item is recommendable. After the teaching unit, an interview study examines students’ strategies for creating decision trees. The findings contribute to understanding students’ learning processes and the challenges when working with decision trees.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims to characterize critical events noticed by novice mathematics teacher-educators (NMTEs) while they facilitate teacher education sessions. Twenty-four NMTEs enrolled in a university course on teaching teachers were asked to facilitate a series of three sessions with preservice teachers, identify critical events from those sessions and analyze these events. Analysis of the 72 critical events reported by the NMTEs yielded a model that can be used to characterize critical events in teacher education sessions (CETEs) and to identify variations within these events. The model comprises three axes: the event participants, the event focus and the dimensions in learning and teaching mathematics (i.e., cognitive, affective and social). The paper discusses the theoretical and empirical construction of the model and demonstrates its potential contribution using examples from our research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Using photographs as data, which involves making observations from images and organizing them into variables to answer statistically investigative questions, is recommended for K–12 level statistics education. Research is needed to support pre-service mathematics teachers’ experiences with exploring such image-based data. With this task-based interview study, the goal was to shed light on (1) the pre-service mathematics teachers’ data-ing actions during identifying and generating variables in relation to data familiarization, question posing, and data organization components and (2) how pre-service mathematics teachers identified and generated variables in the process of data-ing. Data from video recordings, transcripts of the interview sessions for each pair, and their work with photos on the shared online document, that is, groupings and questions posed, were analyzed using a progressive focusing approach. The results showed that the data-ing actions during identifying and generating variables with data familiarization, question posing, and data organization included observing, interpreting, conjecturing, inferring, comparing, grouping, ordering, questioning/question posing, relating variables, categorizing variables, and measuring variables. The pairs used various combinations of multiple actions while data-ing. There were two types of variable identification: (1) observational variables based on visual judgment or metadata and (2) inferential variables based on personal interpretation. The latter type presented a tension between the variable defined and how to measure it objectively, as well as challenges in writing clearly defined variables when posing questions.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Children’s number-based procedures for mental computation have been widely studied but few studies have focused on children’s flexibility with mental computation procedures. In this study, we investigated children’s capacity for procedural flexibility with mental addition by developing and testing a novel assessment that required them to recognize an efficient strategy used by another (fictitious) child. Testing was conducted in eight metropolitan primary schools in Australia and involved administering the assessment to children in Years 3 and 4 (N = 853). The final version of the assessment comprised 23 items and produced data that were closely aligned to the Rasch model, reflected a unidimensional construct and showed good precision and excellent reliability. Findings from item analyses confirmed predictions about the problem features that evoke thinking about particular strategies and the comparative difficulty of strategy types. These findings contribute insights into how procedural flexibility may be operationalised, making it possible to compare instructional approaches for promoting procedural flexibility on a large scale.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>What is considered data and how it is communicated publicly is rapidly changing. Participation in society involves multiple opportunities to engage with complex statistical concepts in media, in personal health, and regarding climate change. Children also are engaging with evolving data types in social media interactions and in educational contexts where they are the data. Yet little time is spent in classrooms supporting children to explore and make their own data decisions about various data types. This study investigates the role that fourth graders’ use of graphing conventions played in supporting their conceptual development of: non-traditional data and dataing during one lesson. The author hopes to contribute a new perspective in conceptualising dataing as enculturating statistical practices around data that involves multiple features, to communicate key information, involving tools for engaging with statistics to communicate a story. In this case study, a video clip presented an entrance point in exploring multivariate data (multiple variables). Video observation and student graphs revealed insights into children’s data and dataing experiences and processes involved with multivariate data, supported by a classroom culture that valued statistical processes as a creative and meaningful, story-telling endeavour. When students were tasked with representing plant growth using a graph, displays included a wide range of variables such as patterns of leaf growth and qualitative stages of plant growth. Engaging with multivariate data in exploratory ways supported students in this study to play with graphing conventions, establishing local mathematical practices involving non-traditional data.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study suggests the framing of structured mathematical modelling (MM) in an authentic scientific-engineering context. Taking a task design view, structure is maintained through inherent scaffolding for the dual purpose of preserving the authenticity of the extra-mathematical context and making the adaptations required to allow incorporation of the task into the duration of a regular lesson and within the full capacity of the curriculum. Participants were 23 secondary school novice mathematics teachers and two experts who possess extensive experience in MM task design. Research tools included a reflective diary filled in by the novice teachers throughout the design process, and a task design evaluation form that was filled in by the two expert designers. Both tools aimed at identifying MM task characteristics and the alignment of the designed structured MM tasks with the MM cycle phases. Findings show the presence of all the unique characteristics that underly a quality designed MM task, with relatively low presence of openness and high presence of accessibility and authenticity from the novice teachers’ point of view. The alignment with the MM cycle was further manifest in the designed tasks, with the validation phase as being less evident compared to the other MM phases. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed in the paper, indicating the sequentially-oriented process by which the structured MM tasks scaffold students through the MM cycle.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item-level count data frequently arise in cognitive, educational, and psychological assessments. Correctly handling different dispersion levels in count data is crucial for accurate statistical inference. This research proposes a Quasi-Poisson item response theory model that accommodates overdispersion, underdispersion, and equidispersion in count data, aiming to explicitly model the connection between the mean and variance parameters, providing a method that is both computationally efficient and statistically robust. This semiparametric model specifies the first two conditional moments for the count variables and derives marginal moments to estimate model parameters. Simulation studies demonstrate the Quasi-Poisson model’s efficacy in parameter recovery across different dispersion scenarios and its negligible computation time. Empirical data analysis further underscores the model’s superior fit and computational efficiency in a real-world setting.

          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>Two-way dual-language immersion (TWDL) programs aim to combine English speakers and speakers of a partner language in the same classroom to receive content instruction in both languages. Stated goals include bilingualism and biliteracy, high academic achievement, and sociocultural competence. In school districts aiming to reduce segregation, TWDL programs also can integrate students from diverse linguistic, racial, and economic backgrounds, although mounting evidence shows that equitable integration does not always happen. Using school-level enrollments and district data on TWDL program growth from 2000 to 2021, this paper describes enrollment and segregation patterns across the Los Angeles Unified School District elementary schools with TWDL programs. We find that elementary schools with TWDL programs are enrolling increasing numbers of racially, linguistically, and economically marginalized students and are generally more diverse than schools without TWDL programs, although there appear to be limits on the potential of TWDL programs to foster diversity, especially in a segregated urban context.
