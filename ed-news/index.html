          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Scalable and accessible professional development programs have the potential to address the opportunity gap many teachers experience. Yet many asynchronous online programs lack interaction with and timely feedback to teachers. We addressed this problem by developing a virtual, interactive program that uses intelligent tutoring systems to provide just‐in‐time feedback to teachers. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with teachers across the United States in which teachers were assigned to either this program or no additional training. We found that teachers who completed our program (N = 29) used mathematically richer tasks and created a more coherent, connected learning environment for students to build conceptual understandings than did teachers who were in the business‐as‐usual condition (N = 23).

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this note from the field is to review the current state of action research studies involving young people currently or recently involved in the foster care system in the United States. Young people in foster care often report feeling that they have little opportunity for advocacy or self-directed change during their time in the system. Action research is presented as an approach to research that appears to provide opportunities for self-advocacy and real-world change among youth in the foster care system. While noting some challenges associated with recruitment and attrition while working with youth in foster care, this note emphasizes the promising potential of action research as a tool to increase youth autonomy and well-being while generating meaningful knowledge and social change within the U.S foster care system. The note, based on a database search that included 636 articles 2013–2023, hopes to contribute to advancing youth-led research in foster care.

          Abstract
                  <p>How teachers attend to and interpret positive relational interactions shapes how they enact instructional practices for equity. We draw on frameworks from equitable mathematics instruction, relational interactions, and teacher noticing to conceptualize mathematics teachers’ relational noticing. Using noticing interview and classroom observation data from a research collaborative between secondary mathematics teachers and university-based teacher educators, we document the range and diversity of ten teachers’ relational noticing. We use this analysis to examine how teachers’ relational noticing supports enacting equitable instructional practices. Our findings indicate five themes of teachers’ relational noticing that are informed by their personal histories, understanding of dominant narratives of mathematics education, and their local sociopolitical school context. Additionally, teachers enacted a range of practices for creating positive relational interactions, with attending to student thinking being the most enacted practice. Our findings suggest that mathematics teachers’ relational noticing can support the three axes of equitable instruction.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics education research tends to center on what Mathematics Teacher Educators-Researchers (MTERs) work on or the people (teachers and students) they work with. Rarely, research in mathematics education focuses on MTERs working with one another. This article decenters from these traditional foci and instead examines a heterogeneous group of MTERs describing their research collaborations for professional development efforts on social justice issues in mathematics education. The MTERs’ paired conversations focused on their retrospective stories of their collaborations were analyzed using an Anzaldúan framework to name the different spaces of collaboration that MTERs identified. Results provide insight into how MTERs’ identified binarized spaces linked to their identities and compounded by issues of power. Nevertheless, MTERs also identified spaces where boundaries were blurred promoting a nos/otras space of collaboration. We discuss how collaboration reaches beyond doing the same research work and sharing talent but also understanding the work of one another.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Based on analysis with four graduate students’ proof productions, this paper characterizes eight ways of operationalizing quantification for reasoning about and constructing proofs. We call these quantification operationalizations quantops. These constructs describe the actions and meanings these students attributed to quantified relationships that rendered them useful for proving. We position these graduate students as experienced provers such that these quantops represent aspirational goals for the learning of more novice students that might be targeted by instruction. Some of these constructs build upon prior studies of quantification, such as fixing and varying an object (The Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 61, 100802 Sellers et al., 2021) or reasoning about dependence or independence between related objects (Educational Studies in Mathematics, 60(2), 149–172 Durand-Guerrier &amp; Arsac, 2005). Other quantops such as cardinality, notation, or multiply-quantified packages represent novel contributions to the literature. A key feature of these quantops was how they allowed students to foreground quantification to construct meaning or to background quantification to manage working memory. We accordingly identify a foregrounding and a backgrounding form of each quantop.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Review studies are vital for advancing knowledge in many scientific fields, including mathematics education, amid burgeoning publications. Based on an extensive consideration of existing review typologies, we conducted a meta-review and bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of and deeper insights into review studies within mathematics education. After searching Web of Science, we identified 259 review studies, revealing a significant increase in such studies over the last five years. Systematic reviews were the most prevalent type, followed by meta-analyses, generic literature reviews, and scoping reviews. On average, the review studies had a sample size of 99, with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines commonly employed. Despite certain studies offering nuanced distinctions among review types, ambiguity persisted. Only about a quarter of the studies explicitly reported employing specific theoretical frameworks (particularly, technology, knowledge, and competence models). Co-authored publications were most common within American institutions and the leading countries are the United States, Germany, China, Australia, and England in publishing most review studies. Educational review journals, educational psychology journals, special education journals, educational technology journals, and mathematics education journals provided platforms for review studies, and prominent research topics included digital technologies, teacher education, mathematics achievement, and learning disabilities. In this study, we synthesised a range of reviews to facilitate readers’ comprehension of conceptual congruities and disparities across various review types, as well as to track current research trends. The results suggest that there is a need for discipline-specific standards and guidelines for different types of mathematics education reviews, which may lead to more high-quality review studies to enhance progress in mathematics education.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Following psychologist Langer’s theory, this study aimed to examine the influence of conditional tasks containing inherent uncertainty on the cultivation of mindfulness. It used preceding research to develop conditional mathematics tasks corresponding to integers and rational numbers, within a 10-lesson curriculum. It divided a total of 182 middle school students in South Korea into three groups: a control group (49 participants), experimental group 1 (62 participants), and experimental group 2 (71 participants). During each of the 10 lessons, experimental group 1 was given a conditional task, while experimental group 2 received 3–4 conditional tasks. Mindfulness was measured before and after the 10 lessons, and a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted. This study’s results revealed that the average scores of the subfactors of mindfulness—novelty seeking and flexibility—increased for both the experimental groups (1 and 2), but decreased for the control group. These findings empirically demonstrate the significance of conditional tasks with inherent uncertainty, in influencing students’ psychological state.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this case study we explored how a mathematician’s teaching of the Cauchy-Riemann (CR) equations actualized the virtual aspects of the equations. Using videotaped classroom data, we found that in a three-day period, this mathematician used embodiment to animate and bind formal aspects of the CR equations (including conformality), metaphors, himself, and his students. We found that the mathematician’s creative introduction of matrices led to a discussion of transformations which made the CR equations mobile and hence gave him a space to virtualize the CR equations. In our results we summarize how the mathematician's assemblage of unusual, unexpected, and unscripted, and without given content creative acts with materials embedded in algebraic and geometric inscriptions and metaphors introduced or catalyzed the new—the virtuality of the CR equations. In our discussion, we highlight how the mathematician bridged the virtual with the abstract via his conceptualizations of the CR equations. Didactic implications include adopting the mathematician’s conceptualizations and asking students to bind them. This could stress the mobility of conformal maps which are generally not taught in an undergraduate class. We propose offering professional development for educators focused on learning how to engineer didactic practices that showcase mobility, support binding, and exhibit animation of mathematical concepts.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>When students engage with a digital tool to tackle a mathematical task, the interplay between their digital competencies and mathematical abilities gives rise to what is termed mathematical digital competency (MDC). Recognising the significance of MDC as an integral component for contemporary students, the relevance of cultivating mathematical digital competency for teaching (MDCT) becomes apparent. We posit that for teachers to effectively guide students in the development of their MDC, possessing MDCT is imperative. In this paper, drawing upon the theoretical frameworks of instrumental orchestration, the documentational approach to didactics, and the Danish competencies framework’s six didactico-pedagogical competencies of mathematics teachers, we propose a theoretical conceptualization of teachers’ mathematical and digital competencies in the context of teaching mathematics with technology. Expanding upon the preliminary definition of students’ MDC, we incorporate pedagogic, theoretical elements tailored to teachers, encapsulating it as MDCT. To expound on the various facets of MDCT, we provide an illustrative example featuring a mathematics teacher proficient in the utilisation of digital technologies and programming.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Educating students to apply probability literacy and reasoning in out-of-school contexts requires the previous preparation of teachers, which should include the assessment of their mathematical and didactic knowledge. Consequently, we investigated three research questions concerning the probabilistic reasoning and literacy of 66 prospective secondary school teachers when solving probability questions related to a report taken from the media news, their ability to identify the fundamental stochastic ideas needed to solve the task, and their capacity to predict their students’ potential difficulties. The participants needed to compute the probability of a complementary event, several conditional probabilities, and perform critical reading of the information in the report. Despite the participants’ good mathematical knowledge, a high percentage showed reasoning biases, such as the fallacy of the transposed conditional, confusion between conditioning and causation, and few identified the information missing to solve a question. There was a poor capacity to determine the stochastic ideas needed to solve the questions, beyond probability, sample space, conditional probability, and sampling. The participants quoted a few potential errors of their students, mainly conceptual mistakes with scarce recognition of interpretation errors. These results reveal the need to reinforce teachers’ probabilistic literacy, reasoning, and related didactic knowledge.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>The purpose of this article is to identify, from the plethora of journals dedicated to publishing research in the field of mathematics education, in general, and from mathematics education’s ‘Group of Seven’, in particular, what I call the Math Ed Majors. In order to do so, I look to men’s professional golf, and men’s major golf championships. Worthy of note, there are only four majors in men’s professional golf. As such, I pronounce only four journals as math ed majors. Recognizing that I may ruffle some feathers, I take into consideration, as has been done in men’s golf, scenarios where there are only three or perhaps five majors. Also taking into consideration that I am constantly on the lookout for and have a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters, because if Canadian mathematics education matters then Canadian mathematics education matters, I provide an honourable mention by drawing parallels between a prominent journal and the Canadian Open. After a bit of translation, necessary for a brief aside where I speak Canadian, I allude to Part II of this manuscript, proclaiming the Math Ed Majors with the explicit purpose of introducing brand-new, unconventional, professional golf–based author productivity indexes.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>While decades of research document inequity in the distribution of teachers across schools, few studies consider the distribution of teacher vacancies and other school hiring needs. We use teacher job postings, a direct proxy of school hiring needs, to document how these hiring needs vary across districts, schools, and subject areas. We first validate job postings as an indicator of school hiring needs by showing that filled postings closely line up with eventual teacher hires. We then show that schools serving more students of color had greater hiring needs throughout the year and that hiring needs for special education and science, technology, engineering, and math positions were considerably higher than for elementary positions according to both the number and duration of job postings.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>I review opportunities and threats that widely accessible Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered services present for educational statistics and measurement. Algorithmic and computational advances continue to improve approaches to item generation, scale maintenance, test security, test scoring, and score reporting. Predictable misuses of AI for these purposes will result in biased scores, construct underrepresentation, and differential impact over time. Recent efforts to develop standards for AI use in testing like those of Burstein are promising. I argue that similar efforts to develop AI standards for educational measurement will benefit from increased attention to the context of test use and explicit commitment to ongoing monitoring of bias and scale drift over time.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Frequent sequential pattern mining is a valuable technique for capturing the relative arrangement of learning events, but current algorithms often return excessive learning event patterns, many of which may be noise or redundant. These issues exacerbate researchers’ burden when interpreting the patterns to derive actionable insights into learning processes. This study proposed permutation tests for identifying sequential patterns whose occurrences are statistically significantly greater than the chance value and different from their superpatterns. Simulations demonstrated that the test for detecting sound patterns had a low false discovery rate and high power, while the test for detecting nonredundant patterns also showed a high accuracy. Empirical data analyses found that the patterns detected in training data were generalizable to test data.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the potential of action research by evaluating the research process, methodological nuances and experiential learnings of an action researcher involved in the action research conducted at Dudhera, a rural village in India on Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). It documents the struggles and resistance of MGNREGA workers of Dudhera. They came together and decided to claim rights under MGNREGA when they felt powerless and starved - of both information and influence over the key decisions that affected their lives. The article critically examines the implementation failure of MGNREGA and the malpractices perpetuated by the Panchayat. It also portrays the community’s determination to bring change by claiming their right and challenging the status quo. The article also presents a reflexive analysis of action research, including the role of action researcher, community engagement and subjective transformation of both self and community in the action research process. The article advances knowledge about participatory action research and its potential for transformative change.
