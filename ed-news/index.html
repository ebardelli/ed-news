          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reports on reflection-based monitoring tools developed and used in an action research project to improve gender equality in science and research institutions. Several of these tools were developed to facilitate individual and joint reflection from the perspective of the co-researchers involved. The aim of the article is to make the case for the integration of a systematic reflection-based monitoring approach, to describe its approach and theoretical underpinnings that link critical reflection theory with reflexive action learning theory, and to present the details of six monitoring tools so that they can be adopted in other project settings. It also highlights how these monitoring tools stimulated both individual and group reflection and how they facilitated the sharing of knowledge and experience between change agents involved in co-production. The article also shows that the process monitoring approach based on systematic reflection can contribute to successful project implementation and offers several important advantages.

        <a href='https://www.springer.com/journal/42330'>Wednesday, 17. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>The teaching and learning of design technology that occurs in nature-based early childhood education and care (ECEC) contexts such as nature kindergartens remains under-theorised. There is a growing body of scholarship that describes how teaching and learning occurs in these contexts as well as highlighting the benefits for young children learning in the natural environment. Recently, in the perspective of the Australian ECEC sector, how students experience design technology in nature-based contexts (bush kinders, an adaption of the European forest school approach to ECEC) was reported on. Despite design technology being accounted for in bush kinders as part of play-based learning of STEM, assessment of how this learning is supporting student’s comprehension of design technology remains an area for further attention. Often, educators rely solely on observations and anecdotal note taking for assessment which points to a need to support teachers with more rigorous assessment models. This paper adapts an assessment model for science learning and reconsiders it in terms of design technology teaching and learning. The paper’s aim is to support educators to develop children’s deeper understandings of design technology and make learning meaningful in nature-based education settings. Using vignettes, the children’s learning of design technology available in natural surroundings is analysed. This paper proposes that bush kinders are a valuable context for teaching and learning as they allow educators to develop skills to assess children’s design technology knowledge. The analysis of the data and its consideration against one play-based learning assessment model is also valuable in generating a broader narrative that deepens insights into the teaching and learning experience of design technology education in early childhood nature-based contexts.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Monday, 15. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Different approaches for measuring instructional quality have been debated. Previous studies based on student ratings have primarily used class-average ratings. Beyond this, the high within-classroom variability of students’ ratings might indicate that instruction caters to some, but not all students. Therefore, we investigated student-reported instructional quality in mathematics classrooms by considering the average student ratings and rating heterogeneity within classrooms. Using a case-centered clustering approach, we aimed to detect meaningful configurations of the level and heterogeneity of student-reported instructional quality in terms of the Three Basic Dimensions (TBD): classroom management, cognitive activation, and student support. We analyzed data from N = 973 grade eight students across N = 106 classes. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), we identified four classroom profiles comprising 20% to 28% of the sample. The results indicate that the profile with the lowest average ratings showed consistently high heterogeneity for all indicator variables. However, the profile with the highest average ratings exhibited consistently low heterogeneity. We gained interesting insights into between-class differences in instructional quality by considering rating heterogeneity. Furthermore, we explored how classrooms from the identified profiles differed regarding socio-economic status (SES) and mathematics-related characteristics (interest, intrinsic motivation, self-concept, and achievement).</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/11858'>Saturday, 13. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Although complex analysis is part of the study programs of many mathematics undergraduates, little research has been done on how individuals interpret basic concepts from complex analysis. To address this gap, this paper investigates how experts individually think about complex path integrals. For this purpose, the commognitive framework is used to conceptualize experts’ interpretations of mathematical concepts discursively, namely in terms of so-called intuitive mathematical discourses. A total of nine interpretations of complex path integrals, so-called discursive images, as well as eight sets of rules governing their construction, so-called discursive frames, are derived from expert interviews. These interpretations range from a rejection of intrinsic meaning to connections with real and vector analysis, mean values, and individual formulations of theorems. The paper also raises questions for the inclusion of the results into teaching and addresses further research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This contribution explores the teaching of graph theory in the context of engineering education. We examine how teachers use collectively designed resources in terms of their backgrounds. After a literature review, we justify the choice to develop an analytical framework for studying the materials in terms of connections to be established in the resources. We suggest developments around the theoretical concept of connectivity, which allows us to analyze the potential connectivity, characterized by the connections enabled by the resources for teaching; and the effective connectivity that develops in teachers’ practices and during the implementation of resources. We study the effective connectivity in terms of each teacher’s personal relationship with graph theory. Graph theory evolves at the interface of mathematics and computer science research. We consider the case of two teachers, a computer scientist and a mathematician in a French Engineering School in France. The data collected consists of resources for teaching graph theory in engineering courses and interviews with teachers. As for results, we characterize how forms of connectivity developed in the use of resources for teaching graph theory are largely determined by the teachers’ backgrounds.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>When analyzing instructional quality in mathematics, observational measures can consider domain-specific instructional approaches (e.g., effective teaching of mathematics) and content-focused practices (e.g., effective teaching of a specific mathematical topic). In this study, we analyze lesson videos from secondary algebra classrooms using two different instruments—one focused on ambitious mathematics teaching practices and one focused on instructional features that support students’ learning opportunities in algebra specifically. We consider the information provided by overlaying these instruments to raise implications for instructional improvement efforts, particularly related to how information from the instruments might inform formative feedback to teachers. We consider how alignment between instrument and instructional emphasis can influence the strengths and areas of instructional improvement identified in a given lesson. We further model a collaborative process for looking across observation instruments to deepen understanding of the information provided.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Colleges and universities are increasingly turning to algorithms that predict college-student success to inform various decisions, including those related to admissions, budgeting, and student-success interventions. Because predictive algorithms rely on historical data, they capture societal injustices, including racism. In this study, we examine how the accuracy of college student success predictions differs between racialized groups, signaling algorithmic bias. We also evaluate the utility of leading bias-mitigating techniques in addressing this bias. Using nationally representative data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and various machine learning modeling approaches, we demonstrate how models incorporating commonly used features to predict college-student success are less accurate when predicting success for racially minoritized students. Common approaches to mitigating algorithmic bias are generally ineffective at eliminating disparities in prediction outcomes and accuracy between racialized groups.

          Abstract
                  <p>The role of teaching, learning, and assessment with digital technology has become increasingly prominent in mathematics education. This survey paper provides an overview of how technology has been transforming teaching, learning, and assessment in mathematics education in the digital age and suggests how the field will evolve in the coming years. Based on several decades of research and educational practices, we discuss and anticipate the multifaceted impact of technology on mathematics education, thus laying the groundwork for the other papers in this issue. After a brief introduction discussing the motivations for this issue, we focus our attention on three lines of research: teaching mathematics with technology, learning mathematics with technology, and assessment with technology. We point to new research orientations that address the issue of teaching with technology, specifically describing attempts to conceptualise teachers’ mathematical and digital competencies, perspectives that view teachers as designers of digital resources, and the design and evaluation of long-term initiatives to support teachers as they develop innovative teaching practices enhanced by digital technologies. Our examination shows that learning with technology is still marked by new conceptualizations raised by researchers that can further our understanding of this complex issue. These conceptualizations support the recognition that multiple resources, ranging from paper and pencil to augmented reality, participate in the learning process. Finally, assessment with technology, especially in the formative sense, offers new possibilities for offering individualised support for learners that can benefit from adaptive systems, though more tasks for conceptual understanding need to be developed.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10649'>Wednesday, 10. July 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Repeating patterning proficiency predicts students’ later mathematical proficiency. A comparative multi-case design enabled the present study to compare patterning success and strategy use for repeating patterns of 75 Norwegian 6-year-old grade 1 students. We provided the students with duplicate, extend, transfer, and unit isolation activities in a semi-structured, task-based interview that was video-recorded. The students’ number sense was also measured using a digital assessment. In-depth analysis of 52 students (divided evenly into two groups based on their number sense scores, lowest and highest) was performed. A statistically significant group difference was found for extend activities. Multimodal video analysis of strategies employed revealed that both student groups used recursive and different strategies and only students with high number sense used relational strategies. The students with low number sense used more variants of recursive patterning strategies. Our findings also demonstrated that attention to pattern features may both hinder identification of a pattern’s underlying structure and reflect advanced strategy use rather than not showing pattern awareness. We discuss group differences in terms of decomposition and awareness of mathematical pattern and structure and emphasise the need for scaffolding awareness of mathematical pattern and structure through communication.</p>
