          Abstract
                    <p>This study aims to explore teacher noticing differences of the sampled US and Chinese elementary teachers from cross-cultural mathematics videos. A total of 34 expert teachers commented on 25 video clips online. We coded what and how teachers noticed from the videos both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings reveal teachers’ strong interests and profound reflections, especially in the teaching domain including representations, communication, and teacher questioning/guide. Cross-cultural differences in teacher noticing were identified, which were discussed based on possible cultural influences. Implications in research and practice, teacher support, and methodology are discussed.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Friday, 31. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we analyse a grade 8 (age 13–14) Japanese problem-solving lesson involving angles associated with parallel lines, taught by a highly regarded, expert Japanese mathematics teacher. The focus of our observation was on how the teacher used carefully planned board work to support a rich and extensive plenary discussion (neriage) in which he shifted the focus from individual mathematical solutions to generalised properties. By comparing the teacher’s detailed prior planning of the board work (bansho) with that which he produced during the lesson, we distinguish between aspects of the lesson that he considered essential and those he treated as contingent. Our analysis reveals how the careful planning of the board work enabled the teacher to be free to explore with the students the multiple alternative solution methods that they had produced, while at the same time having a clear overall purpose relating to how angle properties can be used to find additional solution methods. We outline how these findings from within the strong tradition of the Japanese problem-solving lesson might inform research and teaching practice outside of Japan, where a deep heritage of bansho and neriage is not present. In particular, we highlight three prominent features of this teacher’s practice: the detailed lesson planning in which particular solutions were prioritised for discussion; the considerable amount of time given over to student generation and comparison of alternative solutions; and the ways in which the teacher’s use of the board was seen to support the richness of the mathematical discussions.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>In this study, hypothetical samples of students’ work on a task involving pattern generalizations were used to examine the characteristics of the ways in which 154 elementary prospective teachers (PSTs) paid attention to students’ work in mathematics. The analysis included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their suggestions for supporting students’ further learning. While the findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of mathematical learning, their analyses of students’ thinking and their ideas for supporting students’ learning lacked sophistication. Also, there was considerable divergence between the students’ thinking as evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs’ suggested support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for teacher education.</p>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Friday, 31. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                    <p>This qualitative study examined how prospective mathematics teachers attend to, interpret, and respond to student misconceptions through providing them a video-case-based professional development environment. A sample of 30 prospective teachers attending an elective course was asked to watch video cases about student misconceptions related to the concept of measurement. Then, class discussions were held on the misconceptions, reasons, and suggestions to remedy the misconceptions. Thereafter they individually wrote down their response to an open-ended question asking them how to remedy the misconceptions. Data obtained from the discussions and individual reports were analyzed using the content analysis technique with the framework of professional noticing of children’s mathematical thinking. Findings indicated that the professional development environment provided prospective teachers with an opportunity to attend to, interpret, and then decide how to respond to student misconceptions. We found that while prospective teachers generally understand how students think and why misconceptions arise, they mostly provided partial evidence for interpreting. Moreover, their suggestions for addressing mathematical misconceptions were generally based on conceptual understanding. Our findings suggested that in order to acquire skills in noticing student thinking, it is important that prospective teachers have sufficient opportunity to reflect on likely misconceptions in a professional context.</p>

          Abstract
                    <p>Mathematics coaching is complex work, and coaches must be supported to become experts in mathematics, mathematics instruction, and mathematics coaching. Using video and interview data from 12 mathematics coaches and one district administrator in one public school district in the southeastern USA, this qualitative study explores how the performative aspect of one group of mathematics coaches’ doing the math routine opened up conversations about mathematics, mathematics instruction, and mathematics coaching. Findings indicate that as the coaches engaged in doing the math together, opportunities to discuss mathematics and mathematics instruction were opened up, while conversations about mathematics coaching rarely surfaced. In interviews, participants discussed the benefits and drawbacks of participating in doing the math. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article provides a process to carefully evaluate the suitability of a content domain for which diagnostic classification models (DCMs) could be applicable and then optimized steps for constructing a test blueprint for applying DCMs and a real-life example illustrating this process. The content domains were carefully evaluated using a set of defined criteria, which are purposely defined to improve the success rate of DCM implementation. Given the domain, the Q-matrix is determined by a simulation-based approach using correct classification rates as criteria. Finally, a physics test on the final Q-matrix was developed, administered, and analyzed by the author and the subject-matter experts (SMEs).

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article introduces a new framework for articulating how educational assessments can be related to teacher uses in the classroom. It articulates three levels of assessment: macro (use of standardized tests), meso (externally developed items), and micro (on-the-fly in the classroom). The first level is the usual context for educational measurement, but one of the contributions of this article is that it mainly focuses on the latter two levels. Co-ordination of the content across these two levels can be achieved using the concept of a construct map, which articulates the substantive target property at levels of detail that are appropriate for both teacher planning and within-classroom use. This article then describes a statistical model designed to span these two levels and discusses how best to relate this to the macrolevel. Results from a curriculum and instruction development project on the topic of measurement in the elementary school are demonstrated, showing how they are empirically related.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Friday, 31. March 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The nonparametric classification (NPC) method has been proven to be a suitable procedure for cognitive diagnostic assessments at a classroom level. However, its nonparametric nature impedes the obtention of a model likelihood, hindering the exploration of crucial psychometric aspects, such as model fit or reliability. Reporting the reliability and validity of scores is imperative in any applied context. The present study proposes the restricted deterministic input, noisy “and” gate (R-DINA) model, a parametric cognitive diagnosis model based on the NPC method that provides the same attribute profile classifications as the nonparametric method while allowing to derive a model likelihood and, subsequently, to compute fit and reliability indices. The suitability of the new proposal is examined by means of an exhaustive simulation study and a real data illustration. The results show that the R-DINA model properly recovers the posterior probabilities of attribute mastery, thus becoming a suitable alternative for comprehensive small-scale diagnostic assessments.

          Abstract
                  <p>In this concluding commentary, I embed the articles of the special issue “Transition from school into university mathematics: experiences across educational contexts” into the current landscape of research on secondary–tertiary transition, and discuss the advancement they made related to the synthesis published in 2008 by Gueudet. My aim is to elaborate a new synthesis across the topics of affect and the use of sociocultural perspectives that have framed the work of all contributions. For that, I focus on four major themes. First, I consider the complex relationship between affect and socio-cultural dimensions in the papers, which raises the need for theory networking in further research clarifying mutual roles of the two dimensions. Second, international diversity is only partially expressed in the collection of papers, thus should be a major topic of research in future that would provide a more comprehensive view on the transition from school to university mathematics. I thirdly discuss how the collection of papers deepens our understanding of the complexity and diversity related to the students’ experience with the secondary–tertiary transition and its potential impact for teaching. Finally, I propose and justify the need for systematic design and evaluation of interventions targeting a change in students’ affect related to the transition. In sum, the wide range of the significant findings in this special issue and their mutual relations add new perspectives to the research on secondary–tertiary transition and evidence a new spectrum of research directions.</p>

          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This study explores the prevalence and implementation of four key school counseling policies at the state level and to what extent they are monitored for positive impact on the school counseling profession. Drawing on an analysis of state school counseling policy documents and interviews with school counseling leaders from 30 state education agencies, we found that policies vary considerably across states. Within states, the constrained authority of state counseling officials and lack of funded counseling mandates contributed to differences in policy implementation at the local level. These barriers can unintentionally reduce the efficacy of counseling policies and thus their impact on students.
