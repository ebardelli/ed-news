          Abstract
                  <p>The sanctioned language around “mathematics teacher knowledge” in the US centers pedagogy, content (mathematical knowledge), and students. Yet, this teacher learning approach often promotes (explicitly or implicitly) teaching and learning of mathematics that operationalizes mathematics as rigid, as a gatekeeper, and only useful for global competition in STEM-related fields. These tacit capitalist goals result in teachers being expected to convey “clear and useful” mathematical information to students, not question why mathematics is being taught, who benefits, and/or how to intervene if the learning environment is harmful for students who are Black, Indigenous, students of Color, multilingual, dis/abled, queer, nonbinary, and/or of immigrant backgrounds. In this article, we build upon a form of relational knowing that intertwines mathematics, pedagogies, students, and politics called Political Conocimiento in Teaching Mathematics. Focusing on political knowledge brings the margins to the center by recognizing political issues cannot be separated from other dimensions or added on, as if politics are not already present in mathematics teaching and learning. As three women of Color, we present empirical results from three teacher education programs in the USA with teacher candidates (n = 55) who range in intersectional identities. Using scenario-based activities that support their development of political knowledge, we apply the lens of “The Mirror Test” to highlight how teacher candidates’ intersectional identities influenced the ethical identities they enacted. Some candidates focused more on “accountability” while others focused on “performativity.” We offer implications for future research on ethical identities in mathematics education with teachers and teacher candidates of various intersectional identities.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Although the COVID pandemic dramatically expanded K–12 remote learning in its first years, little is known about the lasting effects on virtual schooling policies and practices. Drawing on evolutionary theories of change and qualitative data from 2019 to 2022, we explore this topic in Oregon, a state with a long history of virtual schools. We find that the pandemic contributed to limited change in state virtual schooling policy and some shifts in local organizational practices. Our data also raise questions about the durability of any changes and the implications for marginalized students. Ultimately, this study provides much-needed insights on the impact of the pandemic on policy and practice, and the utility of multi-disciplinary, equity-oriented theory to understand change processes in K–12 education.

      </h3>

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Tuesday, 18. June 2024</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The issue of model uncertainty has been gaining interest in education and the social sciences community over the years, and the dominant methods for handling model uncertainty are based on Bayesian inference, particularly, Bayesian model averaging. However, Bayesian model averaging assumes that the true data-generating model is within the candidate model space over which averaging is taking place. Unlike Bayesian model averaging, the method of Bayesian stacking can account for model uncertainty without assuming that a true model exists. An issue with Bayesian stacking, however, is that it is an optimization technique that uses predictor-independent model weights and is, therefore, not fully Bayesian. Bayesian hierarchical stacking, proposed by Yao et al. further incorporates uncertainty by applying a hyperprior to the stacking weights. Considering the importance of multilevel models commonly applied in educational settings, this paper investigates via a simulation study and a real data example the predictive performance of original Bayesian stacking and Bayesian hierarchical stacking along with two other readily available weighting methods, pseudo-BMA and pseudo-BMA bootstrap (PBMA and PBMA+). Predictive performance is measured by the Kullback–Leibler divergence score. Although the differences in predictive performance among these four weighting methods in Bayesian stacking are small, we still find that Bayesian hierarchical stacking performs as well as conventional stacking, PBMA, and PBMA+ in settings where a true model is not assumed to exist.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The rank two-parameter logistic (Rank-2PL) item response theory models refer to a set of models applying the 2PL model in a sequential ranking process that occurs in forced-choice questionnaires. The multi-unidimensional pairwise preference with 2PL model (MUPP-2PL) is a Rank-2PL model for items with two statements. Focusing on items with three statements, we develop a maximum marginal likelihood estimation with an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate item parameters and their standard errors. A simulation study is conducted to check parameter recovery, and then the model is applied to a real dataset. Finally, the findings are summarized and discussed, and future research is suggested.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study uses structural equation modeling to investigate the relationships between pre-service teachers’ (PSTs’) course-taking history, beliefs about mathematics, beliefs about students’ mathematical ability, and opinions about (1) how student errors should be addressed when they occur and (2) how much emphasis should be given to various forms of assessment. The results indicate that some types of courses are strongly associated with beliefs about the nature of mathematics. Specifically, PSTs who have taken more mathematics courses are more likely to see mathematics as a set of rules. PSTs’ views about mathematics strongly predict their beliefs about who can do high-level mathematics, how they think student errors should be addressed, and which forms of assessment they think are most appropriate. Implications for teacher preparation programs are discussed.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>An emerging area of research on the diversification of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is that of queer and trans (QT) students who are interested in STEM education and disciplines. The purpose of our study was to identify differences in high school mathematics educational experiences by sexual orientation and gender identity. We used mathematics identity and Leyva’s STEM as a White cisheteropatriarchal space (WCHPS) as our theoretical frameworks to guide our study. Using data from Waves 1 and 2 of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, our exploratory analyses uncovered significant differences between QT and HC students’ mathematics identity. Regression results showed that ideological and relational dimensions of WCHPS in Grade 9 play a significant role in Grade 11 QT students’ mathematics identity. Given the exploratory approach for our study, we aim for our research to begin critical conversations in mathematics education concerning QT students to promote more enriching and welcoming learning environments.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>To objectively compare groups on any latent trait using tests, the absence of differential item functioning (DIF) is crucial. While the importance of DIF has been well-established in research, the question of how to identify DIF-free items is still largely open. The fact that item difficulty is not identified from observations may explain this. Recently, DIF tests utilizing the differences between item difficulties across groups, which are identified, were proposed for the Rasch and 2-parameter logistic models. The current paper aims to extend these approaches to the polytomous case using the partial credit model. Performance of the new approach is assessed using a simulation study, and practical recommendations are made.

          Abstract
                  <p>
                           The interrogation of often unintended practices of marginalisation has gained focus in research on mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education throughout the last decades. In this introductory survey paper, work against marginalisation in these contexts of mathematics education is viewed in terms of work towards equity, diversity and inclusion. Based on this interpretation, we present a framework on awareness and practice of equity, diversity and inclusion in mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education research. We then use this framework and a survey method of mapping review to identify and comment on a selection of studies. As a result, we illustrate three research moves towards equity, diversity and inclusion, in the form of interconnected themes: (1) Widening the understanding of the mathematics and the mathematics education curricula (2) Improving the practice and discussion of mathematics teaching (3) Unpacking ideologies in mathematics teaching and mathematics teacher education. We finally examine the themes and the special issue papers together to foreground commonalities regarding awareness of discriminatory discourses and practices of creating and distributing opportunities for all groups, including those historically and currently marginalised. Despite the important increase of equity-driven principles of awareness, we conclude that mathematics education research on teaching and on teacher education needs more examples of practices whose development has been proved to challenge marginalisation.</p>

      <p>
        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Monday, 17. June 2024</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>This study was an examination of the fractional reasoning of elementary preservice teachers (PSTs) within the context of a dynamic digital environment known as Dynamic Ruler. Using an inductive content analysis approach, we administered four fraction-as-measure tasks to 142 PSTs and devised a comprehensive coding scheme to assess their fractional reasoning. The results showed that PSTs’ fractional reasoning could be categorized into five levels based on how they identified length units and coordinated the units. Notably, this study revealed that adjusting the size of the Dynamic Ruler through dragging could serve as a dynamic mediator, representing the conceptualization of fractions as a measure by identifying appropriate fractional units to measure a given length. We derived practical implications from our study to inform the design of mathematics pedagogy courses aimed at bolstering PSTs’ fractional reasoning.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Language proficiency policies act as critical gatekeepers for multilingual international students (MIS) who intend to pursue an education at English-medium universities. The current study revisits the question of the predictive validity of a standardized English proficiency exam—International English Language Testing System (IELTS)—in comparison with 10 indices of written syntactic complexity. This study addressed the following questions: (a) Do MIS’ overall proficiency and writing subtest scores (IELTS) predict their grade point averages (GPAs) in graduate school? (b) Which syntactic complexity indices in online written production (subordination, coordination, length of production, and degree of phrasal sophistication) predict MIS’ GPAs in graduate school? and (c) Which syntactic complexity indices remain predictive of their GPAs when participants’ English proficiency scores (overall and/or writing IELTS scores) are added into the model? Participants’ IELTS scores, GPAs, and asynchronous discussion postings (224) were analyzed through three linear regressions models. Results confirmed that while IELTS composite and writing subscores do predict academic success of graduate MIS, writing scores are better predictors. After accounting for the contributions of overall and writing subscores, mean length of sentence and T-unit remained significant predictors of academic outcomes, explaining a considerable amount of variance in GPAs, beyond that of IELTS. Equity implications for the admissions of MIS are considered.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>In this study, we leverage national data sources to examine the relationship between community colleges’ level of reliance on local funding and their total institutional revenue, focusing specifically on community colleges educating the largest shares of low-income and racially minoritized students. We show that local funding is positively related to total institutional revenue for the pooled sample including all public community colleges, suggesting that local appropriations can supplement state appropriations in ways that benefit a historically underfunded sector of higher education. However, we also show that community colleges’ level of reliance on local funding is negatively related to their total institutional revenue for rural community colleges and community colleges serving an above-average share of low-income students. Our findings align with scholarship in K–12 finance, indicating that local appropriations, such as property taxes, may exacerbate inequities facing the institutions serving larger shares of economically disadvantaged students.

          Abstract
                  <p>Productive struggle is crucial to students’ mathematics learning. However, it has proven difficult for teachers to sustain struggle when it is productive or make it so when it is not. Studies show that teachers may offer students support when their struggles are productive or even refrain from offering support when students’ struggles are unproductive. This suggests that it is challenging to notice struggle, or more specifically, to attend to and interpret evidence of struggle in determining whether and how to respond. Little research, however, has examined teachers’ noticing of struggle, leaving teacher educators with limited guidance as they strive to prepare teachers to notice and respond to struggle in ways that will ensure students have sustained opportunities to struggle productively. We examined ten middle-school teachers’ noticing of struggle, conceived broadly, while observing students solve challenging problems collaboratively. Teachers attended most to students’ struggles to make sense of the mathematics, less often attending to their struggles to communicate their thinking or overcome challenging group dynamics. Teachers were also guided by three narratives about teaching and learning when interpreting the struggles they attended to, which specified that struggle is productive if students are working well together, making progress, or focused on understanding the mathematics. Teachers typically assessed students’ struggles as productive, especially when attending to students’ struggles to communicate their thinking, yet rarely differentiated their assessments for individual students in a group. We discuss implications for teacher educators striving to prepare teachers to notice and respond to struggle in the classroom.</p>

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Given the importance of conversation practice in language learning, chatbots, especially ChatGPT, have attracted considerable attention for their ability to converse with learners using natural language. This review contributes to the literature by examining the currently unclear overall effect of using chatbots on language learning performance and comprehensively identifying important study characteristics that affect the overall effectiveness. We meta-analyzed 70 effect sizes from 28 studies, using robust variance estimation. The effects were assessed based on 18 study characteristics about learners, chatbots, learning objectives, context, communication/interaction, and methodological and pedagogical designs. Results indicated that using chatbots produced a positive overall effect on language learning performance (g = 0.484), compared to nonchatbot conditions. Moreover, four characteristics (i.e., educational level, language level, interface design, and interaction capability) affected the overall effectiveness. In an in-depth discussion on how the 18 characteristics are related to the effectiveness, future implications for practice and research are presented.

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Universal formal education is a major global development goal. Yet hunter-gatherer communities have extremely low participation rates in formal schooling, even in comparison with other marginalized groups. Here, we review the existing literature to identify common challenges faced by hunter-gatherer children in formal education systems in the Global South. We find that hunter-gatherer children are often granted extensive personal autonomy, which is at odds with the hierarchical culture of school. Hunter-gatherer children face economic, infrastructural, social, cultural, and structural barriers that negatively affect their school participation. While schools have been identified as a risk to the transmission of hunter-gatherer values, languages, and traditional knowledge, they are also viewed by hunter-gatherer communities as a source of economic and cultural empowerment. These observations highlight the need for hunter-gatherer communities to decide for themselves the purpose school serves, and whether children should be compelled to attend.

          Abstract
                  <p>This study aimed to unveil pre-service primary school teachers’ (PPSTs) technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) regarding the unit “Let’s Recognize the Force” suggested by grade 3 science curriculum. Through a single-case (holistic) design of case study method, 43 PPSTs voluntarily participated in the study. To collect data, a Google Form with open-ended questions was developed and administered. In analysing the data, the authors improved a four-point rubric to evaluate the quality of their responses. Hence, they scored their responses through the rubric and imported them into SPSS 20.0™ to run correlation analysis for TPACK components. Also, their responses were exposed to content analysis to generate their conceptual schemes via the “cut-off” points. The findings showed that the PPSTs had some shortcomings in associating and transforming their TPACK to the unit “Let’s Recognize the Force.” The current study recommends that future research should focus on how to improve the PPSTs’ domain-specific TPACK.</p>

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>Prior research documented disproportional representation across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines within the population of students identified as gifted and talented (GT). Less research has focused on what predicts improved representation for English learners (ELs) or students with disabilities (SwDs), or how state GT policies facilitate such representation. This paper attempted to fill that void by analyzing data from the Civil Rights Data Collection and Stanford Education Data Archive along with original coding of state GT policies. We found that while ELs and SwDs are disproportionately underrepresented within the population of students identified as gifted, state mandates for schools to offer GT, requirements for formal gifted education plans, and regular audits for compliance were correlated with higher rates of GT service availability and greater representation among ELs and SwDs. We further describe the characteristics of the top 5% of schools with the highest GT representation for ELs and SwDs.
