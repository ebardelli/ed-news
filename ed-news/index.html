          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Increasing calls for greater STEM-integrated experiences in K–12 education have spawned numerous studies on teacher beliefs, educational goals, and practices for teaching and learning. However, how the field proposes to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge appears to be underresearched. In this systematic review, we analyzed 110 articles to determine (a) in what ways has the literature focused on teacher learning, (b) to what extent the literature addressed the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge, and (c) to what extent the literature identified mechanisms for developing teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge. Results reveal needs that include, among others, more studies focused on developing teacher disciplinary knowledge; studies that differentiate teacher needs at different grade levels; studies that differentiate mechanisms aimed at developing teachers’ pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and disciplinary knowledge; and studies that explicitly examine the mechanisms being used to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge.

Collins writes about the pros and cons of bringing political parties back into school board elections. While partisan elections can bring more voter participation and interest in school governance, they also run the risk of pushing aside real education issues for culture war distractions.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 54-55, December 2024/January 2025. <br>Two common perspectives on the implementation of curriculum and instructional strategies often appear to be at odds. On one side are those who call for fidelity to designers’ plans. On the other side are those who call for the empowerment of teachers to meet individual student needs, regardless of the pace required by curriculum guides. Ronald S. Thomas explains how teachers can use data to find a sweet spot between these approaches.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 42-47, December 2024/January 2025. <br>In the context of both rising antisemitism in the U.S. and the increasing popularity of states mandating the teaching of the Holocaust in K-12 schools, William Smith asks, are such legislative mandates effective? Can states achieve ambitious goals like preventing future genocides and reducing antisemitism by requiring that students learn about the Holocaust? He reviews the limited research on Holocaust education mandates, and Holocaust education generally, with analysis suggesting that such curriculum mandates may not be having the desired effects on student learning. He poses theories about the factors limiting the effectiveness of these mandates.

      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pdk'>Monday, 02. December 2024</a> | 
        
          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 8-13, December 2024/January 2025. <br>The field of mathematics education has engaged in perennial debate about whether transmission-oriented or constructivist approaches to teaching will best help students learn. Yet, both fluency, learned through step-by-step procedural instruction, and the mathematical flexibility that comes from constructivist methods play an important role in mathematical achievement. Rachel S. McClam and Rebecca A. Cruz explain that the math wars debate acts as a straw man, with each side misrepresenting the other and detracting from what students really need — but often lack — to be successful in math: teachers who understand how both approaches work together to support students to become confident and knowledgeable mathematicians.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 20-24, December 2024/January 2025. <br>Elementary preservice teachers enter teacher preparation programs with preformed conceptions of their abilities as mathematics learners that directly influence their sense of self as mathematics teachers. Often, they have had experiences that leave them feeling anxious about their capability to be effective mathematics teachers, which negatively impacts student outcomes. Math autobiographies offer teacher educators a window into the historical factors that influence preservice teachers’ math identity development and help them reflect on how these experiences have shaped them. Providing counterpoint experiences in mathematics pedagogical coursework can help preservice teachers overcome past influences and foster positive identities as future mathematics teachers.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 14-19, December 2024/January 2025. <br>How we should teach mathematics has long been debated by advocates of different instructional approaches. These debates can lead to tensions that are difficult to navigate for those who are new to (or even veterans of) the profession. Educators often propose a “balance” of different approaches as a solution. Charles Munter considers whether such a balance is actually possible — and also considers whether some other questions may be more urgent.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 32-35, December 2024/January 2025. <br>Peter Liljedahl, a professor of education at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, studied math classrooms and students for 15 years. His book, Building Thinking Classrooms in Mathematics, Grades K-12: 14 Teaching Practices for Enhancing Learning, is the result of that research. He found that by disrupting the norms of the classroom – having students work in small, randomized groups at vertical whiteboards or other erasable surface – students are more engaged and more likely to think, not simply mimic back what the teacher is saying.

Natalie Parker-Holliman and Tenisha Marcel-Herbert share practical tools and strategies that schools and teachers can use to build students’ confidence and strengthen their mathematical foundation. They highlight the significance of culture and diversity in mathematics education and the impact of affirming messages on students’ mathematical identity, ultimately fostering a culture of belonging and success in mathematics.

          Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 106, Issue 4, Page 36-41, December 2024/January 2025. <br>Problem behavior disrupts classrooms across the United States, impacting student learning. Despite the adverse consequences, teachers often exclude disruptive students from school as a punitive and default response to problem behavior. Alternatives to exclusion are becoming increasingly popular in many school districts to improve behavior and keep students in the classroom. But these alternatives tend to group students without identifying and addressing their individualized needs. Nasaskyia R. Hicks reviews the existing literature on punitive school discipline, considers the benefits of alternative discipline, and strengthens the underexplored gaps in research by conceptualizing an approach teachers can use.

          AERA Open, Volume 10, Issue , January-December 2024. <br>This paper presents comparative information on the strength of the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and literacy skills at ages 6–8, drawing on data from France, Germany, Japan, Rotterdam (Netherlands), the United Kingdom, and the United States. We investigate whether the strength of the association between SES and literacy skills in early-to-mid childhood depends on the operationalization of SES (parental education, income, or both) and whether differences in inequalities at the end of lower secondary schooling documented in international large-scale assessments are already present when children have experienced at most two years of compulsory schooling. We find marked differences in SES-related inequalities in early achievement across countries that are largely insensitive to the way SES is measured and that seem to mirror inequalities reported for older students. We conclude that country context shapes the link between parental SES and educational achievement, with country differences rooted in the early childhood period.

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/rer'>Saturday, 30. November 2024</a> | 
        
          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this project was to conduct a theoretical literature review of the research that has documented examples of teachers’ principled resistance to curricular control. Principled resistance occurs when teachers reject curricular policies and programs that control their work and conflict with their professional principles. The authors examined the pedagogical commitments that led to teachers’ principled resistance and drew upon Lacey’s and Sikes et al.’s model of teacher socialization to analyze how teachers have engaged in principled resistance. The authors located 62 studies published between 1984 and 2022. Teachers resisted forms of neoliberal curricular control they believed did not meet their students’ academic and social needs, most negatively impacted ethnically diverse and impoverished students, and was not culturally responsive. Teachers enacted principled resistance through strategic compliance, strategic compromise, strategic redefinition, overt and outright resistance, and leaving. Implications for researchers, school administrators, policymakers, and teachers are discussed.

          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Item compromise has long posed challenges in educational measurement, jeopardizing both test validity and test security of continuous tests. Detecting compromised items is therefore crucial to address this concern. The present literature on compromised item detection reveals two notable gaps: First, the majority of existing methods are based upon a non-Bayesian framework; second, many of these approaches exclusively rely on examinees’ responses for detection, neglecting valuable data such as response times. In this study, we propose a Bayesian change-point method that integrates both responses and response times to detect compromised items in continuous tests. This two-phase approach is designed for iterative use. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are assessed in three simulations and an operational data example. The results demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in accurately and efficiently detecting compromised items. Additionally, the incorporation of response times significantly enhances both detection accuracy and efficiency.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Amidst chronic disparities in per-student resources, how best to construct funding formulas to equitably fund colleges and universities is an enduring policy concern. This brief focuses on a historically overlooked financial mechanism, categorical funding, to examine its role in funding (in)equity. Leveraging illustrative data from four equity-oriented categorical programs in the United States’s largest community college system, this study suggests extant funding formulas yield more per-student resources to institutions who serve the fewest students. The largest gaps in funding are associated with key funding formula mechanisms, including base allocations and funding guarantees. Policymakers should consider the tradeoffs when constructing funding policy, as even funds earmarked for equitable purposes may not be allocated in an equitable manner.
