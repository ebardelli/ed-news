          Abstract
                  <p>Given the relevance of graphs of functions, we consider their inclusion in primary education from the functional approach to early algebra. The purpose of this article is to shed some light on the students’ production and reading of graphs when they solved generalization problems from a functional thinking approach. We aim to explore how 3rd and 4th graders construct graphs associated to functions and what elements they use; and how they read function associated graphs and whether they connect pairs of values to see beyond the data. After four working sessions about functions, we designed and implemented individual interviews to 12 students. Through a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the students can read data in a graph on two different cognitive levels and also construct it from different elements of the graph initially provided. Regarding data reading, we evidence two levels: (a) literal reading of a given element in the graph, and (b) reading beyond the data. The construction of the graph is described with base on the axes, values and labels on the axes, scale of the axes, and construction techniques. We present examples of students’ work that evidence that graph construction varied depending on whether it was created from a blank sheet or it was necessary to provide help regarding the axes or the scale of the graph. We describe several techniques used by the students in the representation of data that yield non-canonical representations of a graph and that help glimpse how students are interpreting this representation.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we investigate the issue of representation within the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education (JMTE) and the broader academic publishing landscape, particularly focusing on the underrepresentation of authors from various world regions. A questionnaire, distributed globally, aimed to amplify the voices of the underrepresented, exploring the constraints and affordances of publishing in English-medium mathematics education research journals. The question that guided our investigation was: What do voices from the mathematics education community raise in their responses to questions about publishing in English-medium research journals like JMTE? We used qualitative methods to review the responses and identify common themes. The findings revealed significant barriers and challenges related to language, research location, and institutional support, highlighting the complexities of navigating the global academic community and the academic publishing culture. We propose actionable suggestions to foster a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive publishing environment.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>Critical elements of the expertise of mathematics teacher educators (MTE) can be identified in the artifacts they design for working with prospective teachers (PT), specifically for engaging PT in the double role of practitioners and students of practice. While MTE are increasingly utilizing designed multimodal representations of practice (such as storyboards), theoretical frameworks and methods for analyzing these pedagogical artifacts and the meanings they support are still in early development. We utilize a semiotic framework, expanding systemic functional linguistics to encompass non-linguistic elements, to identify aspects of what we call navigational expertise—which supports PTs in engaging both as practitioners and students of the practice. We view this expertise as tacit knowledge-in-use, enacted through artifact production. The paper demonstrates MTE’s navigational expertise by showing how MTE design storyboards of practice to engage PT as fellow teachers experiencing the lesson taught by a peer and as university students who consider the artifact (including the represented lesson) as an object of study. The framework allows us to identify how MTE’s navigational expertise lies in seamlessly interweaving these two purposes and navigating between them, knowing when, how, and for what purposes to invoke each. Through analysis of storyboards from four MTE in diverse US settings, we uncover some of the nuanced tacit components of navigational expertise, highlighting linguistic and non-linguistic design choices and their potential meanings for transactions with PT.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/epx'>Thursday, 12. September 2024</a> | 
        
          Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Pre-Kindergarten (Pre-K) programs are becoming increasingly common in elementary schools across the United States—in fact, a recent analysis of federal data revealed that 57% of public schools have a Pre-K grade. Despite the prevalence of Pre-K programs in schools, principals—known to be among the most important factors in school success—often lack the knowledge and professional supports to effectively lead Pre-K programs. In this study, guided by sensemaking theory, we work to advance knowledge on Pre-K principal leadership through a sequential mixed-methods analysis of elementary school principals in the state of North Carolina. Our study includes a statewide survey of all lead and assistant principals in the state (N = 520) as well as follow-up interviews with 27 of the surveyed principals. Our findings reveal that while they report strong conceptual support for the Pre-K programs in their schools, principals demonstrate limited engagement with them. We also find that principal background and preparation in early education and the proportion of students from a Pre-K program that ultimately enroll in the school for kindergarten are important factors that help explain variation in principal orientations to Pre-K leadership.

          Abstract
                  <p>There is a burgeoning interest in the concept of identity within mathematics education research, with recent work suggesting that the interplay of identity and capital (cultural, social, and economic resources) offers a productive lens for understanding school students’ trajectories into, or away from, mathematics. This paper adds to understandings of how interactions of identity and capital play out over time, focusing on how these mediated the mathematics degree trajectories of three young men, Tom, Neb, and Gerrard, who were selected from a wider longitudinal study, as the only young people who went on to take mathematics degrees. Analysis of longitudinal data from 24 semi-structured interviews, conducted with the three young men from age 10 to 21 and two of their parents/carers, found that all three identified as being “good/exceptional at mathematics”. These identifications developed at an early age, were sustained and augmented by capital, and were closely related to pursuing the subject at university and enjoyment of mathematics. However, developing and sustaining an identity as “good at maths” relied on interactions with mathematics capital through families, school, and wider networks. Moreover, classed differences in the distribution of capital were implicated in their different degree outcomes. We argue that attending to the longitudinal interplay between capital and identity offers a rich understanding of how young people come to see themselves and be seen by others as “naturally able” at mathematics and in turn supports choosing to study a mathematics degree. Implications for mathematics education policy and practice are considered.</p>

That command is generalized here in several ways in a new command, qqplotg. In this article, I explain the major features of qqplotg and give several examples of its use. Themes include the use of quantile-quantile plots to explore the possibilities for working on a transformed scale and the value of plotting difference between quantiles versus mean quantile or plotting position. Various historical and methodological remarks are sprinkled throughout.

In this article, we provide an introduction to one-sided tests and confidence intervals for a single hypothesis and to one-sided tests and confidence intervals for multiple comparisons. We also discuss extensions of the sotable com­mand introduced in Drukker (2023, Stata Journal 23: 518-544) to cover one-sided tests and confidence bands for a single comparison and for multiple comparisons. We also provide examples of how to use sotable to perform multiple tests against values other than zero and how to perform multiple tests after commands like margins and nlcom that support the post option.

With cnevent, researchers are required to provide only a list of events with the Chinese stock code and the corresponding date for each event, and the command can automatically extract indexes and each individual stock’s return data to run the whole process of the event study. Furthermore, cnevent enables users to choose the benchmark from among different market indexes and different event window sets with options. The command then generates daily abnormal returns for all trading days within the event window and aggregates the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) for the whole event window. Finally, cnevent can plot a graph to show the trend of the CARt within the event window and test whether the event has a significant effect on valuation.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 3, Page 503-513, September 2024. <br>In this article, I describe the miesize command for the calculation of effect sizes in imputed data. There may be situations where an effect size needs to be estimated for an intervention, an exposure, or a group membership variable but data on the independent or dependent variable are missing. Such missing data are commonly dealt with by multiply imputing plausible values. However, in this circumstance, the estimated effect size and associated standard errors will need to be pooled and estimated from the imputed dataset. The miesize command automates this process and calculates effect sizes for a binary variable from multiply imputed data in wide format. The estimates and standard errors (used to calculate the confidence intervals) are recombined using Rubin’s (1987, Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys [Wiley]) rules. These rules are applied such that the average point estimate for the effect size is calculated from the imputed datasets. The pooled standard error, and hence confidence intervals, is calculated to account for both the variance between the imputed datasets and the variance within them. Pooled effect sizes and confidence intervals for Cohen’s (1988, Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, 2nd ed. [Lawrence Erlbaum]) d, Hedges’s (1981, Journal of Educational Statistics 6: 107-128) g, and Glass’s (Smith and Glass, 1977, American Psychologist 32: 752-760) delta are provided by miesize.

          The Stata Journal, Volume 24, Issue 3, Page 371-401, September 2024. <br>AbstractRegression discontinuity (RD) designs are highly popular in economic research because of their strong internal validity and straightforward intuition. While RD estimates are local in nature, several recent articles propose methods that generalize RD estimates to units outside a small neighborhood of the cutoff. In this article, I introduce the getaway package, which implements the method proposed by Angrist and Rokkanen (2015, Journal of the American Statistical Association 110: 1331-1344) to extrapolate treatment-effect estimates “away from the cutoff”, relying on a classical unconfoundedness condition. Additionally, the package features a data-driven algorithm designed to identify a set of covariates that fulfills the unconfoundedness assumption. It also incorporates a toolkit intended for testing and visualization purposes.

Models that can account for spatial dependence and spillovers have been developed for efficiency and productivity analysis, drawing extensive attention from industry and academia. Because of the unavailability of the statistical packages, the empirical applications of the new stochastic frontier models appear to be lagging. The xtsfsp command provides a procedure for fitting spatial stochastic frontier models in the style of Orea and Álvarez (2019, Journal of Econometrics 213: 556-577) and Galli (2023, Spatial Economic Analysis 18: 239-258), enabling users to handle different sources of spatial dependence. In this article, we introduce spatial stochastic frontier models, describing the syntax and options of the new command and providing several examples to illustrate its usage.
