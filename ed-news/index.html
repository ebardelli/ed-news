          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A pervasive issue in the school choice literature is whether schools of choice cream skim students by enrolling high-achieving, less-challenging, or less-costly students. Similarly, schools of choice may “push out” low-achieving, more-challenging, or more-costly students. Using longitudinal student-level data from Indiana, we created multiple measures to examine whether there is evidence consistent with the claims of voucher-participating private schools cream skimming the best students from public schools or pushing out voucher-receiving students. We do not find evidence consistent with the claim of cream skimming. However, we find evidence consistent with the claim of private schools pushing out the lowest-achieving voucher students. This is the first study to examine these two issues within a statewide private school voucher program.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite the critical role of mentors in the preparation of preservice teachers, very little causal quantitative research has explored the effects of offering mentors professional development (PD) around how to coach and support their candidates. We conduct an experimental evaluation of a PD opportunity randomly offered to mentors within six different Tennessee programs over the course of 3 years to investigate its impacts on the perceptions and practices of both the mentors themselves and their candidates. PD significantly increased the frequency of coaching provided by mentors and mentors’ own instructional effectiveness but did not impact their candidates’ satisfaction or feelings of preparedness, though candidates of mentors assigned to treatment were marginally significantly more likely to find employment.

          American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Strengthening teacher supply is a key policy objective for K–12 public education, but understanding of the early teacher pipeline remains limited. In this descriptive analysis, we leverage the universe of applications to a large public university in Texas from 2009 to 2020 to examine the pipeline into teacher education and employment as a K–12 public school teacher. A unique feature of Texas’s centralized higher education application is that it solicits potential interest in teacher certification. We document sharply declining interest in teaching over the period. Further, we show that students of color, men, and students with higher SAT scores are substantially underrepresented in teacher education. Particularly for race/ethnicity, these disparities are only partially explained by differences in interest at application.

      </h3>

          Abstract
      
                  <p>In this study, we investigated undergraduate mathematics students’ (N = 267) attitudes towards proving. The students were taking an introduction-to-proof type course that was situated at the beginning of the mathematics curriculum and lasted for one term. Four attitude variables were measured at the beginning and at the end of the course with a new self-report instrument: self-efficacy, anxiety, appreciation and motivation. The instrument was based on two existing instruments on mathematics attitudes and proof-related self-efficacy. We studied how these four attitude variables were related to the students’ prior skills and their gender at the beginning of the course, how the attitude variables changed during the course, and how they affected the students’ performance in the final course project. Our results indicate that students’ prior performance is linked to their proof-related self-efficacy, anxiety and motivation at the beginning of the course. Female students exhibited lower efficacy and motivation levels than male students. During the focus course, students’ self-efficacy increased and anxiety decreased. The gender gaps in self-efficacy and motivation persisted throughout the course. In addition, high motivation in the beginning of the course predicted good performance in the final project. Based on our results, we conclude that an introductory course on proving can enhance students’ attitudes, and we suggest that these attitudes are taken into account in teaching as they can affect students’ performance. Finally, we urge researchers and professionals to earnestly consider ways to mitigate gender differences in mathematics.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates the embodied, symbolic, and formal reasoning of two fourth-year university students while exploring geometric reasoning about the Cauchy-Riemann equations with the aid of Geometer’s Sketchpad (GSP). These students participated in a teaching activity designed to encourage shifts between embodied, symbolic, and formal reasoning of the Cauchy-Riemann equations as they relate to the amplitwist concept. This research extends previous work related to the complex derivative which only makes use of the limit definition. The Cauchy-Riemann equations naturally integrate notions from linear algebra and multi-variable calculus, which have their own embodied and symbolic interpretations and introduce different challenges in developing a geometric/embodied understanding of the C-R equations. Our work also illustrates how conversations expressed through utterances served as a catalyst for teasing out and connecting the symbolic representations such as the Jacobian and partial derivatives inherent in the Cauchy-Riemann equations. As such, taking part in conversations via utterances with GSP, inscriptions, and other students can create opportunities for students to connect concepts and recognize contradictions across multiple forms of reasoning. We offer potential anticipatory knowledge for complex analysis instructors to facilitate similarly rich conversations within the classroom.</p>

      </h3>

          Abstract
                  <p>Worldwide, education jurisdictions are looking for authentic ways to address First Nations perspectives in the K-12 curriculum, including science education. At the same time, there have been ongoing efforts to integrate authentic and engaging approaches to teaching science, including those that are student-centred, inquiry-based, multimodal, and linked to meaningful contexts. Both goals may be realised through the principle of Two-Eyed Seeing (TES), which seeks to integrate the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing with one eye, and Western ways of knowing with the other eye, for the benefit of all students. This theoretical paper presents a Two-Eyed Seeing for Science Education (TESSE) Framework, which brings together two pedagogical models. One is from a contemporary science perspective, the 5Es representation-rich inquiry approach, which scaffolds authentic student-centred conceptually focused learning experiences. The other is from an Indigenous perspective, the 8 Aboriginal Ways of Learning, which illustrates different ways of knowing—many of which are familiar with First Peoples across the world (e.g., place-based, visual, holistic). The TESSE Framework aims to act as a strengths-based interface between the two knowledge systems to support a culturally responsive approach to teaching and learning science. It is designed to support meaningful connections through curriculum and pedagogy in ways that are contextually relevant to place. Through empirical investigation and in collaboration with local communities, the Framework has the potential to inform current approaches to science education in schools and universities and provide a pathway towards decolonisation and reconciliation.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this manuscript, I argue that narratives of self-care for educators in the midst of pandemic teaching are a form of gaslighting, supported and exacerbated by a neoliberal school system that reinforces individualist, White-normed conceptions of teaching and learning. To make this argument, I use several excerpts from practicing teachers’ writing to illustrate the deep sense of frustration and betrayal that teachers felt when inundated with self-care messages without regard for more systemic support and change.

        <a href='Journal of Teacher Education'>Wednesday, 12. July 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Mentoring is acknowledged as an essential prerequisite for successful teacher induction, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the mentor’s quality of support and the mentee’s initial professional beliefs. Focusing on novice teachers’ self-efficacy and emotional management, this longitudinal study investigates how constructivist- and transmission-oriented mentoring approaches support beginning teachers’ professional development, and how these approaches interact with the novices’ initial beliefs about teaching and learning. The data stem from a sample of 138 beginning teachers who participated in an online survey during their second and third trimesters of practical training in Germany. Moderated regression analyses indicate positive effects of constructivist mentoring on teacher self-efficacy 6 months later, and an enhancing moderation effect of mentees’ mismatching, transmissive beliefs. Results neither support distinct effects of constructivist mentoring on novices’ emotional management nor associations between transmissive mentoring and the outcomes. Implications for mentoring research and practice are discussed.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/edr'>Wednesday, 12. July 2023</a> | 
        
          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>We provide novel evidence on the broader impacts of school choice systems by quantifying disparities in peer continuity from middle to high school in New York City. We find that Black and Hispanic students and those in high-poverty neighborhoods attend high school with a much smaller fraction of their middle school or neighborhood peers than their White, Asian, and low-poverty neighborhood counterparts. Disparities also emerge in peer isolation: 27% and 20% of Black and Hispanic students transitioned with no other student from their middle school, while only 7% to 8% of White and Asian students did. Group differences in choice similarity, which in part reflects systematic variation in the number of local school options, drive this result.

        <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/home/jeb'>Tuesday, 11. July 2023</a> | 
        
          Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>In the existing multidimensional extensions of the log-normal response time (LNRT) model, the log response times are decomposed into a linear combination of several latent traits. These models are fully compensatory as low levels on traits can be counterbalanced by high levels on other traits. We propose an alternative multidimensional extension of the LNRT model by assuming that the response times can be decomposed into two response time components. Each response time component is generated by a one-dimensional LNRT model with a different latent trait. As the response time components—but not the traits—are related additively, the model is partially compensatory. In a simulation study, we investigate the recovery of the model’s parameters. We also investigate whether the fully and the partially compensatory LNRT model can be distinguished empirically. Findings suggest that parameter recovery is good and that the two models can be distinctly identified under certain conditions. The utility of the model in practice is demonstrated with an empirical application. In the empirical application, the partially compensatory model fits better than the fully compensatory model.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Undocumented immigrants face learning, compliance, and psychological costs when confronting in-state resident tuition (ISRT) policy implementation. Building on administrative burdens scholarship and using qualitative data from 19 semi-structured interviews with undocumented youth immigrants, this article examines administrative burdens that may discourage and prevent students from accessing ISRT policy—a public benefit aimed at extending their educational opportunities. Findings demonstrate that undocumented youth navigate multifaceted contexts, including multiple rules at different organizational levels and interactions with admissions officers whose attitudes may facilitate or obstruct access. This study spotlights how some intended beneficiaries may be more affected by stigma and fear, depriving them of accessing public benefits. Furthermore, the study shows how bureaucratic procedures reinforce existing social inequalities by affecting those less well-positioned to address burdens.

          Abstract
                  <p>Addressing the participation rates in senior secondary mathematics courses in Australian schools remains a critically important issue. In this paper, the authors report on quantitative findings from a study in which all year 11 and year 12 (aged 17–18 years) Australian Tertiary Admissions Ranking (ATAR) students in Western Australia were invited to participate. The aim was to explore the perceptions of these students regarding their enrolment in higher-level mathematics courses. Data from 1633 students were collected using a survey instrument comprised of 12, 5-point, Likert-scale items. Data were analysed by applying two statistical procedures: calculating frequencies of the 12 items in the scale and examining associations with demographic characteristics and individual items through generalised linear modelling. Analyses indicated most students agreed that other courses of study were more attractive, with almost half indicating that they did not like mathematics. In addition, approximately half of the students said that they did not need to enrol in any mathematics course for ATAR or for university entrance. Significant findings were also identified for gender, school type, and school gender. The knowledge gained from this research is valuable in understanding students’ reasons for choosing not to enrol in higher-level mathematics courses when they have the option to do so and, more broadly, to address persistently low or declining participation rates in these areas of study.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>A small but growing body of research confirms that people in the LGBTQ + (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other identities) community are among those underrepresented in STEM (science, technology engineering, and math). This is concerning because diversity and inclusion improves science for all. In response, Canadian institutions have developed initiatives aimed to address issues in which LGBTQ + students disproportionately leave STEM fields. LGBTQ + postdoctoral scholars (postdocs) are of particular interest because they have developed clear professional and LGBTQ + identities, they are significant contributors to their fields, and they work at the intersection of STEM students and faculty. Studies have highlighted poor job satisfaction and career opportunities for this group. This qualitative study explored the values, beliefs, and experiences of 14 Canadian LGBQ + postdocs in STEM through semi-structured interviews about coming out, experiences of LGBQ + mentorship/representation, and their beliefs on staying within science and academia. Interview data was analyzed thematically from a post-structural perspective. Main themes emerged: (1) coming out, (2) representation, and (3) mentorship. This exploratory qualitative study offers insight into how the experiences of this understudied group are helpful in disentangling discourses surrounding coming out, representation, and mentorship for LGBQ + researchers in STEM.</p>

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Future Forward leverages both tutoring and parent engagement to support the literacy development of early primary students. In 2010, Future Forward was awarded an Investing in Innovations grant to develop and test its impact in seven Milwaukee Public Schools, primarily serving Black and Latinx students. A randomized control trial evaluation found 2 years of participation had positive impacts on foundational literacy, reading achievement, and school attendance (Jones &amp; Christian, 2021). We followed participants 5 years past the end of the i3 study to determine whether benefits were sustained. Students receiving Future Forward continued to demonstrate improved reading achievement, school attendance, and were less likely to be placed into special education. Even considering this, Future Forward participants fell behind in their reading development over time.

      Abstract
                  <p>
      The mathematics education literature indicates a consensus regarding the importance of developing algebraic thinking in elementary school mathematics. However, the approaches used to implement this concept vary around the world. This study examines how a popular standards-based elementary mathematics textbook series in China provides opportunities to learn about functional thinking, which is a key component of algebraic thinking. Building on the literature, an analytical framework was generated to examine the features of function-related tasks in the textbook series across grades. The results of the fine-grained coding analysis show that four categories of function-related tasks in the textbook provide opportunities to learn about multi-modes of functional thinking. These tasks primarily serve to enhance arithmetic learning, while offering opportunities to learn about functional thinking as an embedded component. Elaborated design and arrangement of the function tasks promote opportunities to learn about multiple modes of functional thinking. In addition, two pathways to support the development of functional thinking are identified. Finally, the implications for task design and textbook development which attempt to develop functional thinking are discussed.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This paper concerns undergraduate mathematics students’ understandings of refutation and their related performance in abstract conditional inference. It reports on 173 responses to a refutation instrument that asked participants to: 1) state ‘true’ or ‘false’ for three statements, providing counterexamples or reasons if they thought these false (all three were false); 2) evaluate possible counterexamples and reasons, where reasons were ‘corrected’ versions of the statements but not valid refutations; and 3) choose which of the counterexamples and the corrected statements were better answers, explaining why. The data show that students reliably understood the logic of counterexamples but did not respond normatively according to the broader logic of refutations. Many endorsed the corrected statements as valid and chose these as better responses; we analyse their explanations using Toulmin’s model of argumentation. The data further show that participants with better abstract conditional inference scores were more likely to respond normatively by giving, endorsing, and choosing counterexamples as refutations; conditional inference scores also predicted performance in a proof-based course.
