          AERA Open, Volume 11, Issue , January-December 2025. <br>State education agencies have increasing influence over educational policy and practice, with responsibilities ranging from vision setting to monitoring compliance with accountability policy. Although state education agency leaders are well positioned to advance change, capacity building at this level of the education system has been traditionally limited. Research–practice partnerships (RPPs) represent a promising venue to support the ability of state leaders to facilitate educational change. In this qualitative study, we drew on semistructured interviews with state education agency leaders and observations of RPP meetings to examine the state-level structures that pose challenges to leaders’ efforts to make change and how participating in an RPP can support leaders in addressing these challenges. Findings reveal how RPP engagement supported state leaders with navigating complex organizational silos and bureaucratic processes by promoting relationship building and supporting the use of evidence-based resources. These insights may inform future research and capacity-building efforts at the state level of the education system.

          Abstract
                  <p>The use of metacognitive strategies when working on modelling problems in small groups is assumed to lead to goal-oriented and effective processing of the problems. Based on the analysis of eight group processes of grade 9 students working on a modelling problem, this article takes a detailed look at the initiation of metacognitive behaviour by individual students in the group process. For this purpose, videos were coded using a deductive category system in accordance with structuring qualitative content analysis, which was enriched inductively. As a result, the metacognitive strategies initiated by individual students were classified according to two criteria: the time of occurrence (during or between modelling phases) and if they relate to the content of task processing and to the behaviour of group members. Furthermore, seven aims were identified, three of which were related to different areas of metacognitive strategies, and four of which arose from the level of collaborative and socioemotional engagement in the groups. Additionally, the latter could be linked to the extent to which the groups worked together cooperatively or collaboratively and to the extent to which the individual members were included and valued in the work process.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>It has been established that, in Bayesian tasks, performance and typical errors in reading information from filled visualizations depend both on the type of the provided visualization and information format. However, apart from reading visualizations, students should also be able to create visualizations on their own and successfully use them as heuristic tools in modeling tasks. In this paper, we first want to broaden the view on Bayesian reasoning to probabilistic tasks with two binary events in general and embed the whole process of solving these tasks using probabilistic visualizations in a modified modeling framework. Thereby, it becomes apparent that most of the steps remained untouched by existing research. Second, in the present empirical study, we focused on one part of the largely unexplored creation process and examined entering statistical information into empty visualizations as heuristic tools. N = 172 participants had to enter conditional and joint probabilities or the corresponding frequencies into empty visualizations in a paper-and-pencil test. We analyze (a) students’ performance when entering information in visualizations and (b) typical errors, both dependent on the information format (probabilities vs. natural frequencies), which empty visualization structure (2⨯2 table, double tree, net diagram) was provided, and type of information (conditional vs. joint information). The well-known positive effect of natural frequencies on participants’ performance was evident when entering conditional information into 2⨯2 tables and net diagrams. However, with respect to joint information, no superior effect of frequencies was observed. Furthermore, the theoretical implementation of our research in a modeling cycle allows us to identify desiderata for future research.</p>

      </h3>

        <a href='https://link.springer.com/journal/10857'>Thursday, 06. February 2025</a> | 
        
          Abstract
                  <p>Critical events are incidents encountered by teachers in their practice that can potentially provoke questions about the instructional decisions made, gaining an entry to changing and improving teaching practices. Current research often conceptualises critical events as those that occur during instruction, but critical events can also occur before and after instruction, especially in the contexts of lesson study. In this paper, I will unpack the notion of a critical reflection event during the study, plan, and reflect phases of lesson study through three vignettes that happened during a lesson study cycle. This paper examines how lesson study positions teachers to notice critical reflection events that can provoke pedagogical reasoning and action for the purpose of gaining new comprehension.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This study explores secondary-school mathematics teachers’ noticing of Critical Events Associated with Argumentation (CEAs), moments when students’ reasoning or interactions become evident, offering teachers opportunities to promote argumentation in the classroom. Thirty-one teachers analyzed a written classroom scenario, identifying CEAs, interpreting their potential for fostering argumentation, and proposing teaching alternatives. The findings reveal that teachers identified CEAs emphasizing either mathematical arguments, collaborative interactions in constructing and evaluating arguments, or both, with a primary focus on dialogic interactions. The identified CEAs, along with their interpretations and proposed strategies, demonstrated alignment, by focusing on common underlying aspects. The dynamic interconnection among components of noticing—attending, interpreting, and responding—challenges linear models, suggesting iterative and holistic processes. By framing CEAs as opportunities to integrate structural and dialogic aspects of argumentation, this study contributes to refining noticing frameworks and advancing teachers' professional development. Theoretical and practical implications for research on noticing and argumentation in mathematics education are discussed, alongside recommendations for future studies.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>In this cultural-comparative study, we examined the recommendations for instructional modifications made by 12 Czech and 12 non-Czech mathematics teacher educators (MTEs). The non-Czech MTEs were selected from countries culturally distinct from Czechia, including Costa Rica, Japan, Kosovo, Türkiye, the UK, and the USA, with two MTEs from each country. The participants were invited to provide written feedback on a part of a video lesson (teaching segment) in which a Czech elementary mathematics teacher handled student errors. The results demonstrated that the Czech MTEs emphasized individual learning and content, while the non-Czech MTEs’ feedback was more diverse, advocating a more collaborative and reflective learning environment. Drawing on the limitations of our study, implications for future research are provided.</p>

          Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this essay, we explored the feasibility of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for qualitative data analysis in equity-focused research. Specifically, we compare thematic analyses of interview transcripts conducted by human coders with those performed by GPT-3 using a zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting strategy. Our results suggest that the AI model, when provided with suitable prompts, can proficiently perform thematic analysis, demonstrating considerable comparability with human coders. Despite potential biases inherent in its training data, the model was able to analyze and interpret the data through social justice perspectives. We discuss the applications of integrating AI into qualitative research, provide code snippets illustrating the use of GPT models, and highlight unresolved questions to encourage further dialogue in the field.

          Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher turnover is a persistent policy concern in public education. Researchers have documented negative impacts of turnover on student outcomes; yet we know little about the causal mechanisms by which turnover influences, or disrupts, schools’ efforts to improve. In our longitudinal qualitative study, we examined how turnover affects relationships, trust, and shared knowledge in organizations—that is, organizational social capital—in ways that can impede school improvement efforts. We found that teacher turnover depletes organizational social capital by disrupting networks and relationships between teachers working in teams, weakening shared meanings and goals in schools, and impeding teachers’ ability to collectively engage in problem-solving and learning. We illuminate the hidden ways in which instability undermines improvement efforts and strains organizations.

          Abstract
                  <p>Academic emotions play a crucial role in mathematics learning, significantly influencing motivation, academic achievement, and career aspirations in mathematics. With the notable increase in research on emotions in recent years, our review uses Pekrun’s control-value theory with two primary objectives: to systematically describe the characteristics of emotions in recent research through a systematic review, and to synthesize evidence on the relationships between specific emotions, control-value antecedents, and mathematics achievement via a meta-analysis. The systematic review of 112 studies revealed that more than 100 specific emotions have been addressed in recent research, which we analyzed based on key emotion characteristics: valence and activation, type of object, temporal stability, and social context. The findings from the systematic review provide an overview of mathematics-specific objects that emotions have referred to in the most recent research. The subsequent meta-analysis demonstrated that mathematics achievement (e.g., test scores and grades) was positively related to enjoyment, hope, and pride (

          Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics teacher education is now a well-established field of research, but it is only in recent years that research attention has turned towards the learning and development of mathematics teacher educators themselves. In this special issue, interest centres on mathematics teacher educator expertise and how this can be represented, developed, and studied. The research studies published in this issue aim to move beyond category-based descriptions of mathematics teacher educator knowledge and explore the broader complexity of expertise as blend of knowing, doing, believing, and being. In doing so they capture the dynamic and interconnected nature of expertise. In this commentary article, I reflect on what we can learn from these studies about the complexity of MTE expertise and use these insights to suggest directions for future research.</p>

          Abstract
                  <p>This mixed-method study uses interviews and an online questionnaire to investigate the obstacles that hinder teachers’ implementation of mathematical modelling in everyday classrooms in China. Thirty high school mathematics teachers were interviewed, and 200 teachers completed an online questionnaire regarding their perceived obstacles. We identified six critical obstacle groups: missed opportunities to learn mathematical modelling education in professional development and/or teacher education; students’ lack of knowledge and interests; lack of examples in textbooks; lack of suitable teaching materials; non-favourable curricula tradition and school policies; and a strong traditional focus on examination culture. The obstacles identified and their relationship to and role in current in-service teachers’ practices are explored and interpreted from a sociocultural perspective considering, among other factors, the significance of central examinations in China and the historical prevalence of pure, structurally oriented mathematics in school.</p>

          Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Social and emotional learning (SEL) programs are widely used, yet concerns have arisen about whether the evidence for these programs extends to students of color (SOC). The data in this study include published articles (n = 158) of trials (n = 97) of SEL interventions (n = 32) from the CASEL SELect list of evidence-based SEL programs. Using racial frames common in intervention research, we examined the extent of SOC representation in SEL intervention trials, how authors attend to race/ethnicity in their analyses, and whether and how these analyses show evidence that these programs benefit specific racial/ethnic groups. While doing so, we discuss the complex nature of race and racism in SEL research. Eight interventions provided some evidence that they benefit Black students and four showed some evidence that they benefit Hispanic/Latiné students. No trials provided evidence of benefit to any other groups of SOC. Findings suggest that while representation of SOC in SEL trials has improved, additional research is needed to understand to whom the evidence for SEL program effectiveness applies.

          Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Social innovation (SI) is gaining attention to explore how multistakeholder initiatives create new social practices for local food system development. Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) is a group-based certification scheme for sustainable farming, comprising new social practices that require changes in relationships and roles. Research highlights potentials of PGS to produce SI; however, without providing insights into the innovation process, needed to learn how relationship and role building occur and how SI can be facilitated through action research. We addressed these gaps in a four-year action research that co-developed a PGS in Argentina. The overall aim of studying relationship and role building required to establish PGS was operationalized by i) analysing ambitions for change of relationships of involved groups; ii) examining how relationship building evolved and how it was facilitated; and iii) exploring changes in role understanding and performance. Therein, we reflected on how action research can enhance SI and transformation in local food system development. The processual analysis showed that SI was facilitated when narratives of change were shared across stakeholder environments and a socially constructed facilitation mandate was created. Critical role reflection was stimulated, while performance was constrained when individual benefits were uncertain, underscoring the need to elaborate on role expectations in the initiation phase.
