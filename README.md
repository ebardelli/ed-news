# ed-news

## Overview

This repository is a small static site generator and feed builder written in Python. It produces an `index.html` and an RSS feed from a collection of feeds and metadata. The project is organized as a package named `ednews` and a set of top-level scripts used to build and publish the site.

Most of this project was vibecoded with GitHub Copilot using GPT-5 mini.

Files in `ednews` correspond to small modules that the tests exercise. The top-level scripts (`build.py`, `main.py`, `fetch.py`) call into the package code.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment and activate it using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Build and run

To generate the site output into the `build/` directory run the top-level build script:

```bash
uv run python build.py
```

There is also `ednews.build` which contains the core build logic and is exercised by tests. `main.py` provides a small CLI wrapper.

The generated output will be placed in `build/` and includes `index.html`, `index.rss`, and a `static/` folder with assets.

## Tests

Run the test suite with pytest:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Tests live in the `tests/` directory and include unit and integration tests for CrossRef, feeds, DB and embeddings helpers.

### CrossRef Tests

Enable CrossRef integration tests by setting the RUN_CROSSREF_INTEGRATION environment variable, then run the full test suite.

```bash
# persistent in current shell
export RUN_CROSSREF_INTEGRATION=1
uv run pytest -q

# or as a one-liner
RUN_CROSSREF_INTEGRATION=1 uv run pytest -q
```

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Run tests before submitting PRs and follow the existing code style. If you add external integrations, include mocks or fixtures in `tests/fixtures` to keep test runs fast and hermetic.
