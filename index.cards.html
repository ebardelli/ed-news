  Abstract
                  <p>This qualitative survey study set out to investigate in-service and pre-service primary school teachers’ perceived barriers to and enablers for the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning in an Australian educational context. While research over the past three decades have documented pedagogical benefits of teaching mathematics using children’s literature, research into teachers’ perceptions regarding the use of such resources is virtually non-existent. The study thus filled this research gap by drawing responses from open-ended survey questions of 94 in-service and 82 pre-service teachers in Australia. A thematic analysis revealed 13 perceived barriers classified under five themes with Lack of Pedagogical Knowledge and Confidence, and Time Constraint, representing 75% of all perceived barriers. Moreover, 14 perceived enablers were identified and classified under five themes with Pedagogical Benefits and Love of Stories representing around 70% of all perceived enablers. Findings also showed that most of the teachers in the study (around 75%) never or infrequently used children’s literature in their mathematics classrooms. The study highlights the role of professional learning and teacher training in ensuring that both in- and pre-service teachers have the necessary pedagogical knowledge, experience and confidence in using children’s literature to enrich their mathematics teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The present study had the purpose of investigating empirically the structure and relationships among mathematical imagination, mathematical knowledge and mathematical mindset. The three factors are constituent parts of the Innovation Engine model by Seelig (inGenius: A Crash course on creativity, HarperOne-2012) and can influence creative thinking. The participants were two hundred seventeen sixth grade students from three urban and eight rural primary schools. The data were collected by administering a mathematical imagination test, a test measuring mathematical knowledge and a questionnaire capturing their mathematical mindset. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied through Smart PLS in order to examine empirically the proposed path model describing the relationships among the three factors contributing to mathematical creative thinking, namely, imagination, knowledge and mindset. The data analysis yielded that the proposed model of the paper fulfilled all evaluation criteria of partial least squares structural equation modeling. In short, students’ mathematical knowledge could be explained directly and moderately by their mathematical mindset. In addition, mathematical imagination could be explained directly and to a large extent by mathematical knowledge and indirectly by mathematical mindset. Finally, the main implications for mathematics teaching are discussed and potential research directions are suggested.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Despite an increase in special education enrollment, a stark gap in high school completion between students with and without disabilities persists. This study examined the impact of Unified Champion Schools (UCS), a Special Olympics program designed to foster social inclusion through three components—Unified Sports, Inclusive Youth Leadership, and Whole School Engagement—on high school graduation rates. Using a novel dataset and a difference-in-differences design, we found that implementing the UCS program increased the graduation rate by 1.1 percentage points for all students and 1.4 percentage points for students with disabilities. The increase in schooling outcomes for students with disabilities in UCS schools also was found to be positively correlated with perceptions about a more socially inclusive school environment.

  Abstract
                  <p>Previous research in mathematics education has explored teachers’ conceptions of mathematics and its teaching and learning, and how their instructional tendencies (e.g., “traditional”, “technological”, “spontaneous” and “investigative”) relate to these conceptions. However, empirical evidence on this topic from large samples of pre-service teachers is limited. This study adapts and validates an instrument originally designed for in-service teachers to analyse the conceptions of mathematics and mathematics teaching and learning. This was done in a sample of undergraduate students in several different degree programmes (primary education, mathematics, and the education itinerary in psychology) in a Spanish university. Existing theory about instructional tendencies and conceptions of mathematics teaching and learning that was developed in the context of in-service teachers is then re-examined in the context of empirical evidence from this sample of individuals (all potential future teachers) without teaching experience. Results show that items from the instrument can be separated into four factors focussed on investigative stances, the role of textbooks, the role of teachers and lesson planning. Individual participants are not characterised by single tendencies; rather, they can be described in terms of several combinations of tendencies, grouped into four clusters. In line with the previous literature on in-service teachers, results suggest that conceptions of mathematics and its teaching and learning are not best captured by rigid, sharply delineated profiles. Rather, individuals configure their own conceptions in terms of combinations of different characteristics of prototypical tendencies.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For teachers of immigrant-origin students and their peers, emerging research notes the challenge of facilitating a high-quality education for students subject to traumatic events related to harsh immigration enforcement policies. This study examines whether new teachers from seven teacher preparation programs experienced the impacts of immigration enforcement and felt prepared to support students who were impacted. I surveyed new teachers in preservice and after 1 year of teaching (N = 473) using survey instruments developed by Cohen and colleagues along with additional constructs developed via pilot testing. New teachers reported that immigration enforcement negatively impacted their students and their job satisfaction. Teachers exposed to discussion of immigration policy and teachers who reported engaging with immigrant families in preservice were more likely to view themselves as prepared to support students. I discuss differences for teachers in urban, Title I, and elementary settings.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We examine access to effective teachers for low-income students in 26 geographically dispersed school districts over a 5-year period. We measure teacher effectiveness using a value-added model that accounts for measurement error in prior test scores and peer effects. Differences between the average value added of teachers of high- and low-income students are 0.005 standard deviations in English/language arts and 0.004 standard deviations in math. Differences between teachers of Black, Hispanic, and White students are also small. Rearranging teachers to obtain perfect equity would do little to narrow the sizable student achievement gap between low- and high-income students. We also show that a higher proportion of novice teachers in high-poverty schools contributes negligibly to differences in access to effective teachers.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Nationally, educators suspend Black students at greater rates than any other group. This disproportionality is fueled by stereotypes casting Black students as “troublemakers”—a label students too often internalize as part of their identities. Across two independent double-blind randomized field trials involving over 2,000 seventh graders in 11 middle schools, we tested the efficacy of a brief intervention to buffer students from stereotypes and mitigate the racial suspension gap. The self-affirmation intervention helps students access positive aspects of their identities less associated with troublemaking in school. Confirmed in both trials, treatment effects cut Black-White suspension and office disciplinary referral gaps during seventh and eighth grade by approximately two thirds, with even greater impacts for Black students with prior infractions.

  Abstract
                  <p>The literature highlights differing views on the efficacy of modelling lessons for teacher professional learning. In this study we draw on dissonance theory to discuss lesson modelling that seeks to transcend ‘do as I do’ imitation and provoke teachers’ attention to intended teaching practices: a necessary pre-cursor for changes to practice. A collective case study investigated the experiences and perceptions of 18 practising primary teachers from four school contexts participating in the process of: collectively observing modelling of mathematics lessons in their classrooms, analysing different parts of those practices with the modeller, and enacting them. It was found that modelling lessons associated with inquiry-oriented approaches for developing students’ problem-solving and reasoning in teachers’ own classrooms appeared to confront their assumptions about traditional approaches to teaching and learning mathematics. The teachers’ surprise at their students’ engagement in the challenging learning experiences conflicted with their existing views of teaching and impelled them to reflect on and set goals for improving their practice. Suggestions for pre- and post-lesson protocols for stimulating productive discussions are proposed, along with implications for designing school-based professional learning processes using lesson modelling.</p>

Using an original data set of state policies, we find that governors ordered school closures in spring 2020 but left decisions to districts in the fall, regardless of partisanship. Analyzing local district reopening plans, however, we find that decisions were more tied to local political partisanship and union strength than to COVID-19 severity. Republicans in the public were also more favorable than Democrats toward in-person learning. States’ decisions to leave reopening plans to their districts opened the way for the influence of local partisanship.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>There is growing interest in how to better prepare K–12 students to work with data. In this article, we assert that these discussions of teaching and learning must attend to the human dimensions of data work. Specifically, we draw from several established lines of research to argue that practices involving the creation and manipulation of data are shaped by a combination of personal experiences, cultural tools and practices, and political concerns. We demonstrate through two examples how our proposed humanistic stance highlights ways that efforts to make data personally relevant for youth also necessarily implicate cultural and sociopolitical dimensions that affect the design and learning opportunities in data-rich learning environments. We offer an interdisciplinary framework based on literature from multiple bodies of educational research to inform design, teaching and research for more effective, responsible, and inclusive student learning experiences with and about data.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Vocational education and training (VET) is a common form of upper secondary school tracking in countries around the world. There are ongoing debates regarding the effects of this differentiation on academic and labor market outcomes; however, evidence on civic outcomes is lacking. Using a unique cohort study in Germany (N = 2461) and a doubly robust weighting approach with a rich set of baseline covariates to address selection bias, we estimated the effects of VET (relative to academic upper secondary school) on political interest, internal political efficacy, and intent to vote across 15 years of late adolescence and early adulthood. We estimated negative effects of VET on these civic outcomes, particularly as participants grew older. Implications for future research and VET policy are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>Teacher dashboards in mathematics classrooms tend to provide teachers with information on student performance that are often linked to classroom management systems, online course systems, or peer-tutoring software. Teacher dashboards also tend to emphasize features that support teachers using a “transition” or “direct instruction” model. In our approach, we iteratively designed, developed, tested, and refined a teacher dashboard that is linked to a student digital collaborative environment with an embedded problem-based mathematics curriculum. In this study, we investigate teacher dashboard features that support teacher enactment of problem-based mathematics curriculum embedded in a digital collaborative platform. We report on design principles that guided the development of three teacher dashboard features: (1) monitoring evidence of student thinking in real-time or after class, (2) accessing workspace for whole-class discussions of the problem, and (3) creating and sending “just-in-time” supports. The pedagogical advantages and challenges teachers face throughout the iterative development process are also discussed. Evidence from observational data and teacher interviews suggests that the organic synergism generated from the student and teacher digital platform offers several ways that teachers are provided with new and timely information from teacher dashboards that supports problem-based mathematics teaching.</p>

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this article is to explore the authors’ and the co-authors’ reflexivity in feminist participatory action research, conducted in three kindergartens in Indonesia, aiming to disrupt traditional gender discourses in early childhood education settings. Kindergarten is one of the most gendered spaces that perpetuate the binary between femininities and masculinities. This research takes place in Indonesia, one of the most populous Muslim countries in the world. The first part of the study deals with our own reflexivity as university lecturers, middle class and Muslim women, and we use these as a departure point to understand multiple positioning taken by our nine co-researchers as kindergarten teachers, women as well as Muslims and how these influence their gender understanding. The second part of the study discusses the journey of our co-researchers from having gender blind to more gender flexible attitude. As the co-researchers began to acknowledge their personal values, they were better able to apply gender flexible pedagogies to their kindergarten context. The co-researchers also demonstrate different forms of action in implementing gender flexible pedagogy. Our study suggests continuous reflexivity and the possibility of translating gender flexible pedagogy into the co-researchers’ local context were essential factors in this action research.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Civil courage refers to the behavior where people actively intervene to protect a victim in a concrete situation of injustice despite the risk of becoming a victim themselves. To act with civil courage, one requires competencies that relate to prosocial values as well as the physical and social ability to act. In this context, this brief reports the opinions of 2,046 respondents—representatives of Germany with respect to age, gender, and region—on what, according to them, are the best contexts for learning civil courage. “At home and/or from family” as well as “through volunteering” are considered the most suitable contexts to learn civil courage. In contrast, television, social media, and the internet are considered the least supportive contexts.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical reasoning has an important place in many primary and secondary curricula around the world. In the particular case of Quebec, it is a competency that has had a prescribed assessment framework for nearly 20 years. However, little is known about teachers’ understanding of mathematical reasoning or the practices they use to foster its development in the classroom—both in Quebec and elsewhere. In this article, we analyze the discourse of teachers in order to examine how they conceptualize mathematical reasoning and what practices they believe are critical for its development. The Mathematical Discourse for Teaching framework (Cooper 2015) helps to characterize these practices. Results from our study pinpoint key words, shared and hoped-for routines, narratives that are generally endorsed by the community as well as commognitive conflicts. Specifically, mathematical reasoning is associated either with a competency to be assessed or, more broadly, with a process of understanding. These two manners of conceptualizing mathematical reasoning lead to different routines, but also to a tension between the desire to help students make sense of mathematics and the requirement to test competency based on a specific rubric. These findings appear to be linked to the fact that the Mathematical Discourse for Teaching (MDT) of primary teachers is based on multiple discourses that do not necessarily share the same founding principles or metadiscursive rules, which leads to inherent commognitive conflicts for teachers in this community.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Classroom observation research plays an important role in policy, practice, and scholarship for students with disabilities. When interpreting results of observation studies, it is important to consider the validity evidence provided by researchers and how that speaks to the intended use of those results. In this literature synthesis, we used Kane’s argument-based approach to validity to describe evidence of validity for uses of observation instruments in classroom observation research regarding teachers of students with disabilities. We identified 102 studies from 1975 to 2020 that met inclusion criteria. Results indicated many studies did not report validity evidence to support their use of the observation instruments. Over time, reporting levels for much of the evidence has remained relatively constant, but we noted a consistent decrease in number of observations conducted per teacher and a consistent and large increase in reporting of teacher participant characteristics. We provide implications of this for research and practice and suggestions for improving classroom observation research.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>As parents are increasingly given flexibility to enroll their children in a school of their choice, understanding parents’ preferences for school qualities is essential. Using a randomized survey experiment, this study adds to the existing literature by assessing parents’ preferences in a controlled environment, where they can be isolated from information asymmetries and constraints. Results suggest that achievement matters to parents but status matters more when evaluating quality and growth matters more when choosing between schools. Additionally, student demographics affect both parents’ perception of school quality and their likelihood of selecting into a school. This article has important implications for the theory and practice of accountability as it offers new insights on parents’ latent preferences for school qualities.

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to call for research on sexual identity in mathematics education. I first define key terms and their relationships. Next, I discuss how students’ sexual identity relates to school experiences and outcomes. I then summarize existing research on sexual identity and STEM/mathematics education. Finally, I recommend research on sexual identity and mathematics education that can advance our field in a continued commitment to equitable mathematics teaching and learning.</p>
