  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This paper uses a validity argument approach to examine the validity evidence for measures of instructional alignment based on an instrument adapted from the Surveys of Enacted Curriculum (SEC). Using the instrument, Grade 4 math and Grade 5 English language arts teachers reported the level of emphasis they gave to subject-specific topics and cognitive demands in their instruction, which provided the data for measuring instructional alignment—both overall and by topic and by cognitive demand—with state standards. We found that (a) teachers differentiated topics but not cognitive demands when reporting on the content of their instruction, (b) teachers likely overreported levels of emphasis on topics and cognitive demands, and (c) overall alignment and alignment by cognitive demand were not significantly associated with teachers’ value-added scores. Although this study examined a specific version of the SEC, we believe the findings apply more broadly to SEC-based measures of instructional alignment.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>As future physicians, first-year medical students are well positioned to work on the long-term creation of a more equitable healthcare system. But how prepared are first-year medical students to begin the work of dismantling structural racism in the US healthcare system? In this study, we analyzed a sample of 75 medical-student reflective responses to a book focused on the legacy of racism in medicine. Our findings indicate that students enter medical school in a range of states of critical consciousness that are visible in their “stances” toward addressing racial inequality in the healthcare system. The stances described in our findings extend the critical consciousness framework, providing a more nuanced understanding of students’ starting orientations to health justice. Because students arrive in different stances toward confronting the systemic inequalities inherent to the US healthcare system, understanding these stances may help medical educators tailor learning experiences to medical students’ needs more effectively.

  Abstract
                  <p>Reasoning with mathematics plays an important role in university students’ learning throughout their courses in the scientific disciplines, such as physics. In addition to understanding mathematical concepts and procedures, physics students often must mathematize physical constructs in terms of their associated mathematical structures and interpret mathematical entities in terms of the physical context. In this study, we investigate physics students’ reasoning about mathematics in relation to physics content addressed in two quantum mechanics problems. Through qualitative analysis of interview data from twelve students, results show that 1) students use intricate, nonuniform problem-solving methods with reasoning that moves fluidly between structural (mathematizing and interpreting) and technical (conceptual and procedural) skills in quick succession, and 2) student reasoning about orthonormal bases, change of basis, inner products, and probability informed their flexibility in choosing problem-solving approaches. We illustrate the results with examples of student reasoning and discuss the inextricability of mathematics and physics in students’ reasoning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>A case study of calculus instructional material (comprising of lecture notes and tutorial practice worksheets) designed by teachers from a Singapore pre-university is presented in this paper. As textbooks have not been available for mathematics at the pre-university levels, the instructional material was a product of the teachers’ collaborative work based on their interpretation of the school mathematics curriculum. Through a study of the instructional material, the teachers’ instructional goals and their alignment to the curriculum were examined. It was clear that the instructional material was more than a mere compilation of resources for the instruction; the teachers’ effort was also in building the close connection within and across the concepts and sub-topics. The discrete parts of the content were organized under a “big idea” in the lecture notes. Anchor questions were used in the tutorial practice worksheets to facilitate students to recognize the similarity of the underlying structures of seemingly different questions. In addition to the teachers’ articulated instructional goals such as covering all the key concepts, reducing students’ cognitive load, or developing their algorithmic mastery, the study revealed the unarticulated goal as to raise the students’ cognitive growth, which could be explained by the APOS cognitive growth model. In aligning to the school curriculum, it was observed that the teachers made judgement to tap on the advantage of the spiral curriculum to advance their students’ understanding of calculus from the secondary level using a higher perspective, and to better their students’ understanding of calculus concepts in addition to focusing on algorithmic mastery. The effort to engage their students in problem-solving and the use of technology to develop higher order thinking or enhance conceptual understanding remained implicit.

  Abstract
                  <p>TRansforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources (TRIUMPHS) is a multi-year, multi-institution collaborative project funded by the US National Science Foundation aimed at developing and testing student projects based on primary historical sources related to the original or subsequent development of core topics in today’s tertiary mathematics curriculum. In addition to developing a broad range of projects and supporting their site testing by instructors across the US and Canada, TRIUMPHS includes a major Evaluation-with-Research component that is studying the effects of their classroom use on students and instructors. Our goal in this article is to share an overview of our research efforts related to the student learning experience—and as importantly, the tale of how we arrived at them—with others engaged in the effort to transform instruction in the field of undergraduate mathematics education. We provide a summary of three research initiatives undertaken by TRIUMPHS: a metadiscursive rules investigation based on Sfard’s theory of commognition, an exploratory study of the concepts of transgressive actions and boundary crossings (first put forth by Polish psychologist Jozef Kozielecki) within the context of student learning of mathematics, and an examination of the different views students hold regarding the nature of mathematics. Additionally, we offer methodological reflections on how we revised our research questions and analytic tools based on theoretical constructs from mathematics education and beyond as the project unfolded over the first 6 years.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Quadratics provide a foundational context for making sense of many important algebraic concepts, such as variables and parameters, nonlinear rates of change, and views of function. Yet researchers have highlighted students’ difficulties in connecting such concepts. This in-depth qualitative study with two pairs of Year 10 (15 or 16-year-old) students investigated the potential of figural pattern generalisation—a context not traditionally used for teaching quadratics—to stimulate students’ coordination of visual and algebraic reasoning and attention to quadratic function concepts. Theorisations of embodied visualisation, algebraic thinking, and student noticing were drawn on to analyse the pairs responding to 19 quadratic figural pattern generalisation tasks interspersed throughout their class topic on quadratic equations. It was found that students became adept at connecting the generality of different types of structural aspects of figures (square, rectangular, linear, constant/invariant) to their symbolic expression in quadratic equations. Students’ construction of numeric instantiations of figural aspects was found to support pairs in moving towards symbolic generalisation. Task prompts to find different (but equivalent) algebraic equations for the same pattern evidenced pairs beginning to distinguish among general, factorised and standard forms of quadratic equations. One pair’s attention to first and second differences (between total quantities of figures in a sequence) highlighted both the difficulty of and potential for connecting quadratic rate-of-change concepts and parameters visually. Implications for including figural pattern generalisation when teaching quadratics and suggestions for further research are shared.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This is a longitudinal qualitative study of Latina college students who were members of a Latina mentoring program at a 4-year Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) in Texas, where they made up the largest student population since 2013. Guided by Chicana feminist epistemology and intersectionality, we discuss educational experiences students had during high school as they considered their college path, when enrolling in an HSI, and during college. We explore the following research question: How did intersectional experiences shape the educational trajectory of Latina undergraduates enrolled at an HSI? We identify how multiple forms of oppression and social identities shaped the high school experiences of Latinas and learned how they found belonging at an HSI by finding spaces and individuals who validated their intersectionality. Through this study, we demonstrate why Latina student intersectionality—not only while in college but prior to enrolling as well—is important for researchers and educational leaders to consider.

  Abstract
                  <p>Construct maps and related item type frameworks, which respectively describe and identify common patterns in student reasoning, provide teachers with tools to support instruction built upon students’ intuitive thinking. We present a methodological approach–embedded within common assessment development processes–for developing such construct maps and item type frameworks which entails (1) articulating a construct map, (2) developing diagnostic item types, (3) comparing item type difficulties, and (4) modifying or providing evidence in support of the construct map. We present an example focused on students’ proportional reasoning based on its centrality to mathematical success. The results further inform our construct map for students’ proportional reasoning and provide a diagnostic item-type framework.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Finding opportunities for elementary preservice teachers to engage in mathematics for themselves and to collaborate in their enquiries was the focus of this study, carried out at two English Universities. Preservice teachers on 1-year postgraduate programmes engaged in shared mathematics enquiry, with a focus on growing patterns. We conducted interviews with 15 preservice teachers and analysed the interview data alongside their subsequent lesson plans and lesson evaluations. We explored the awarenesses that emerged through deliberate retrospective analysis of sharing what others were seeing and how this influenced their prospective thinking about their own teaching. Our findings indicate that even when preservice teachers struggle to make sense of what others are seeing, they recognise that some approaches may be more efficient or insightful than others, and that listening to others’ ideas is a powerful learning opportunity for teachers and children. This has implications for initial teacher education programmes internationally. There is value in providing preservice teachers with opportunities to engage with mathematics as a shared experience, and in enabling and supporting deliberate retrospective and prospective reflection of this activity.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Many states use high-school exit examinations to assess students’ career and college readiness in core subjects. We find meaningful consequences of barely passing the mathematics examination in Massachusetts, as opposed to just failing it. However, these impacts operate at different educational attainment margins for low-income and higher-income students. As in previous work, we find that barely passing increases the probability of graduating from high school for low-income (particularly urban low-income) students, but not for higher-income students. However, this pattern is reversed for 4-year college graduation. For higher-income students only, just passing the examination increases the probability of completing a 4-year college degree by 2.1 percentage points, a sizable effect given that only 13% of these students near the cutoff graduate.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>In the face of today’s urgent societal challenges, there are constant calls for regional governments to respond to them. Yet, policies, including those developed through action research, appear to be transforming too slowly. This paper focuses on love as a methodological dimension of action research that can energize these responses. One of the main features of love is that it requires mastering the interplay between reason and emotion, and I use art-based action research as a vehicle to explore this interplay. More specifically, my data in this paper are the poems I wrote when I participated in an experiment led by an artist on social media. The discussion of the case focuses on how we can use the lessons learnt in the experiment to integrate love in action research for territorial development.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this survey paper we focus on mathematics learning in Chinese contexts, as a way to contribute to broader discussions about mathematical learning. We first review the features of Chinese students’ mathematical learning depicted in the literature, followed by a review of student mathematical learning in recent Chinese research journals. This leads to an introduction of the papers on Chinese students’ learning in this issue. For Chinese students’ learning contexts, we discuss four aspects, namely, classroom instruction, teachers’ professional learning, curriculum materials, and learning outside of school. For each context, we review the literature findings on the identified features, introduce emerged practices and most recent policies under the reformed era, and discuss the relevant papers in this special issue. Whenever possible, we connect findings on Chinese students’ learning with the associated contexts and relate these findings in the Chinese contexts to findings in the broader world context. We conclude this survey paper with possible lessons learned from Chinese students’ learning features and from the varied Chinese contexts. In particular, we discuss these aspects from culturally contextualized and semantically decontextualized dimensions, which is expected to facilitate broad international discourse centering on the three questions proposed at the end of this paper.</p>
