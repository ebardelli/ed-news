  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 52-55, March 2022. <br> Educational leaders are facing unprecedented challenges that many do not feel prepared for, especially when it comes to promoting equity. Ann Ishimaru explains that an expansive view of leadership that incorporates historically marginalized youth, families, and communities will enable schools to better serve all students. Schools have a history of focusing on managerial and administrative expertise and ignoring the expertise within the communities they serve, but Ishimaru offers examples of initiatives that have sought to bring more people — especially people of color— into leadership with positive results.

The U.S. Department of Education agrees, advising schools that “every effort should be made to structure environments and provide supports so that restraint and seclusion are unnecessary.” Even so, more than 100,000 students are restrained or secluded in U.S. public schools every year. Most are students with special needs.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 5-7, March 2022. <br> The conversation about how schools can best serve children with disabilities stretches back for decades, long before the passage of IDEA. Teresa Preston traces how Kappan authors deliberated over where and how students should receive special education services. Although authors have generally supported educating students with disabilities alongside their nondisabled peers, many have expressed skepticism about the benefits of full inclusion for every child. Others have noted that many of the strategies employed in special education might also benefit all students and suggested that special education expand its reach.

Too often, schools, districts, and states focus on complying with the regulations, while failing to make necessary changes to improve student outcomes. Catherine Voulgarides describes how the confusing, cumbersome, and compliancedriven IDEA policy landscape interacts with the complex efforts to achieve equity. She shares examples of districts that were able to come into compliance with IDEA equity requirements in ways that contradicted what educators consider best practice and without examining the root causes of inequities. She concludes with recommendations for how to improve IDEA when it is next reauthorized.

Kayla Bill, Amanda Bowsher, Betty Malen, Jennifer King Rice, and Jason Saltmarsh conducted a survey and focus groups to explore how COVID-19 has influenced undergraduates’ interest in and perceptions of teaching. The pandemic has had mixed but troubling effects on undergraduates’ interest in teaching, and while it has increased their respect for teachers, it has also magnified their concerns about salary, safety, workload, and the disrespect teachers endure. Addressing these long-standing concerns may increase the likelihood that this sizable pool of prospective teachers will pursue teaching and help alleviate teacher shortages.

In those early days, he recounts, students with disability were mostly segregated from other children, and many of the adults who worked with them assumed they were uneducable. Since that time, the field has come a long way, and inclusive placements and teaching practices have become widespread. But still, Wehmeyer argues, traces of the old segregationist mindset remain. Perhaps the time has come, he concludes, to rethink the usefulness of “special education” as a category and to focus instead on providing personalized supports and services to all students.

  Abstract
                  <p>The Iberoamerican Mathematics Olympiad (IbMO) is one of the most successful and established regional Olympiads in the world with the participation of all Iberoamerican countries. Its origins are a confluence of two mayor events: on the one hand the organization of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in the Americas for the very first time in 1981 and on the other hand a Latin American effort for the modernization and improvement of mathematics education embodied by the CIAEM—Comité Interamericano de Educación Matemática (or, alternately, the Congreso Interamericano de Educación Matemática). This localized Olympiad with a more homogeneous population proved very quickly to be an important steppingstone for Iberoamerican countries to prepare their participation in the IMO resulting in a collaborative effort to improve mathematics education in the region. Other very successful smaller regional mathematics Olympiads in Iberoamerica sprouted from this effort as well as from Iberoamerican efforts to establish similar experiences for other cohorts of students, such as younger students, university students and students of other sciences. In that same decade, other regional olympiads were born around the world, such as the Pan African Mathematics Olympiad (1987), the Asian Pacific (1989) or the Balkan Mathematical Olympiad (1985). Their impact in the regions was appreciated, recognized and adapted to other regional Olympiads worldwide.</p>

As Joshua Starr explains, failing fast isn’t really an option for public school leaders who have to seek public approval for their decisions. And in contentious times, transparency in decision making is as important as ever. Those leaders who’ve taken the time to build relationships and share their decision-making processes with stakeholders will garner trust that will help when they make decisions that don’t work out as planned.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 56-57, March 2022. <br> Research has shown that teachers’ biases often inform their instructional decisions. Andrea Brownlee reflects on how this finding played out in his own life as a Black child growing up in a community engulfed by the crack epidemic in the 1980s. His teachers tended to focus on his behavior and the ways his problem-solving methods differed from the norm, and they seemed unprepared to offer lessons that connected to what was happening in Brownlee’s community. Yet his community provided him unexpected opportunities to learn. He urges teachers to learn more about what the children they teach are facing and to dismantle the oppressive norms that get in the way of their success.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 60-61, March 2022. <br> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused chaos in local schools, and education has been the subject of countless news stories about the crisis. And, as Maria Ferguson explains, the U.S. Department of Education has been unable to articulate a bold vision for schools as local leaders adapt to constantly changing circumstances. At the state level, on the other hand, Virginia’s new governor, Glenn Youngkin, appears to be making education as centerpiece of his policy agenda with a series of executive orders forbidding the teaching of divisive topics and ending mask mandates.

There is definitive scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of applied behavior analysis (ABA) as an educational intervention for children with autism, yet ABA is not formally included as a related service under IDEA. Juliet Hart Barnett discusses how ABA can address the needs of students with autism, the barriers to its implementation, and why it should be treated as a related service that schools provide under IDEA.

Funding and staffing are ongoing difficulties, and COVID brought some teacher recruitment and retention efforts to a halt. She suggests that districts adopt a multitiered system of support to better identify students needing support and reduce improper over-identification of students of color as needing services.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 21-26, March 2022. <br> IDEA provides essential guidance and legal support for students with disabilities, yet its conceptual and systemic framework tends to promote a focus on student deficits. Thus, teachers and IEP team members may have low expectations of students with disabilities and fail to encourage the development of their talents. Lisa DaVia Rubenstein, Charles Sandifer, and Robyn Spoon propose the adoption of a conceptual framework known as the axiom of brilliance, which assumes students are brilliant. To meet students’ needs in their areas of brilliance, they recommend that educators adopt a more holistic approach that purposefully identifies student strengths and uses that information to design appropriate learning experiences.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 41-45, March 2022. <br> Stand-alone reading intervention courses, or reading classes, are designed to facilitate the literacy development of adolescents who have been deemed “struggling” readers. However, the existence of such courses does not mean that these goals are realized. Decades of qualitative research on youth perspectives and experiences have documented how inequity can persist within reading classes. Nevertheless, district mandates or curricular adoptions often require schools to offer these courses. To mitigate students’ negative experiences when these courses are offered, Maneka Deanna Brooks, Katherine K. Frankel, and Julie E. Learned draw on their research to propose a four-phase process to evaluate and revise policies and practices for placing students in reading classes.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 6, Page 46-51, March 2022. <br> When parents push back against educators’ comments or recommendations about their children, those parents may actually be reacting to a long history of negative interactions with schools. This is especially true when Black parents are interacting with white educators. Research has shown that teachers, who are predominately white, tend to communicate differently with parents of color than they do with white parents. Too often, the relationships between educators and parents become characterized by mistrust, rather than the kind of collaboration that can support students. Psychologist Pamela Brown offers suggestions for how educators can learn to trust parents of color and become more trust-worthy partners with parents.

  Abstract
                  <p>The Learner’s Perspective Study (LPS) offers an extremely rich source of data for analyses of classroom situations. In this paper we focus on events in mathematics classrooms through the lens of the Theory of Didactical Situations in Mathematics, namely, on the situation of institutionalization. During the phase of institutionalization, the teacher tends to help pupils to transform a piece of their knowledge from the means of resolving a problem to a reference for further uses in new situations. A detailed analysis of transcripts of communication between a Czech teacher and her 14- to 15-year-old pupils resulted in the classification of institutionalization into four types, as follows: asking additional questions referring to statements from the stage of validation with the aim of adding new knowledge to the repertoire; presenting a mathematical proof of a statement from validation; asking pupils to solve a similar problem; and setting problems for pupils, whose solution will allow them to apply the acquired knowledge. These are presented and illustrated in the paper. The combination of video-recordings from three cameras (one recording the teacher, one a pair of pupils and one the whole class), together with interviews with the teacher and the pair of pupils, materials prepared by the teacher, and pupils' productions, allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the role of institutionalization in mathematics education.</p>
