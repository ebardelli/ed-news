  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>With increased tensions and political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement in the United States, schools are facing greater challenges in ensuring support for their students of immigrant and Latinx origin. This study examined the associations between county-level immigration arrests and academic achievement, absenteeism, and measures of school climate and safety for students in the California CORE districts. Using ordinary least squares regression analyses with year, grade, school, and student fixed effects, we found that immigration arrests corresponded to declines in academic achievement, attendance, and various measures of school climate and safety for Latinx students and Latinx students who were English learners. We also find small declines in measures of school climate and safety for students who ever received special education services via an Individualized Education Program. Associations were strongest for arrests that occurred during the Trump administration compared with those that occurred during the second term of the Obama administration. Policy implications are discussed.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 756-771, September 2021. <br>Social scientists frequently rely on the cardinal comparability of test scores to assess achievement gaps between population subgroups and their evolution over time. This approach has been criticized because of the ordinal nature of test scores and the sensitivity of results to order-preserving transformations that are theoretically plausible. Bond and Lang (2013, Review of Economics and Statistics 95: 1468–1479) document the sensitivity of measured ability to scaling choices and develop a method to assess the robustness of changes in ability over time to scaling choices. In this article, I present the scale_transformation command, which expands the Bond and Lang (2013) method to more general cases and optimizes their algorithm to work with large datasets. The command assesses the robustness of an achievement gap between two subgroups to any arbitrary choice of scale by finding bounds for the original gap estimation. Additionally, it finds scale transformations that are very likely and unlikely to benchmark against the results obtained. Finally, it also allows the user to measure how much gap growth coefficients change when including controls in their specifications.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 772-813, September 2021. <br>In models with endogenous regressors, a standard regression approach is to exploit just-identifying or overidentifying orthogonality conditions by using instrumental variables. In just-identified models, the identifying orthogonality assumptions cannot be tested without the imposition of other nontestable assumptions. While formal testing of overidentifying restrictions is possible, its interpretation still hinges on the validity of an initial set of untestable just-identifying orthogonality conditions. We present the kinkyreg command for kinky least-squares inference, which adopts an alternative approach to identification. By exploiting nonorthogonality conditions in the form of bounds on the admissible degree of endogeneity, feasible test procedures can be constructed that do not require instrumental variables. The kinky least-squares confidence bands can be more informative than confidence intervals obtained from instrumental-variables estimation, especially when the instruments are weak. Moreover, the approach facilitates a sensitivity analysis for standard instrumental-variables inference. In particular, it allows the user to assess the validity of previously untestable just-identifying exclusion restrictions. Further instrument-free tests include linear hypotheses, functional form, heteroskedasticity, and serial correlation tests.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 575-601, September 2021. <br>Trials of interventions that aim to slow disease progression may analyze a continuous outcome by comparing its change over time—its slope—between the treated and the untreated group using a linear mixed model. To perform a sample-size calculation for such a trial, one must have estimates of the parameters that govern the between- and within-subject variability in the outcome, which are often unknown. The algebra needed for the sample-size calculation can also be complex for such trial designs. We have written a new user-friendly command, slopepower, that performs sample-size or power calculations for trials that compare slope outcomes. The package is based on linear mixed-model methodology, described for this setting by Frost, Kenward, and Fox (2008, Statistics in Medicine 27: 3717–3731). In the first stage of this approach, slopepower obtains estimates of mean slopes together with variances and covariances from a linear mixed model fit to previously collected user-supplied data. In the second stage, these estimates are combined with user input about the target effectiveness of the treatment and design of the future trial to give an estimate of either a sample size or a statistical power. In this article, we present the slopepower command, briefly explain the methodology behind it, and demonstrate how it can be used to help plan a trial and compare the sample sizes needed for different trial designs.

(2021, Journal of Econometrics 220: 416–446) and Cui et al. (2020a, ISER Discussion Paper 1101). The underlying idea of this approach is to project out the common factors from exogenous covariates using principal-components analysis and to run IV regression in both of two stages, using defactored covariates as instruments. The resulting two-stage IV estimator is valid for models with homogeneous or heterogeneous slope coefficients and has several advantages relative to existing popular approaches.In addition, the xtivdfreg command extends the two-stage IV approach in two major ways. First, the algorithm accommodates estimation of unbalanced panels. Second, the algorithm permits a flexible specification of instruments.We show that when one imposes zero factors, the xtivdfreg command can replicate the results of the popular Stata ivregress command. Notably, unlike ivregress, xtivdfreg permits estimation of the two-way error-components paneldata model with heterogeneous slope coefficients.

Some graphical and tabulation commands have dedicated options serving that end. Otherwise, in practice a new order is often best achieved by creating a new variable holding the desired order using one or another egen function. There is usually a need to preserve the information in existing values or value labels and to watch out for ties. There may be a desire to reverse the direction of ranking from the default. I discuss procedures for datasets based on aggregate frequencies and for datasets based on individuals and introduce a new convenience command, myaxis, that handles many cases directly.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Executive function skills are a set of cognitive processes that help individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior and have been linked to benefits in academic achievement and other learning-related outcomes. Recently, there has been interest in understanding how attending center-based preschool may relate to the development of executive function skills. This study used the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011 (n ~ 9,270) to examine the association between preschool attendance and executive function skills in each grade of elementary school. The results of the analysis suggest small initial associations of preschool attendance with some subdomains of executive function (working memory) but not others (cognitive flexibility). These associations are heterogenous based on preschool type (i.e., public vs. private). The longitudinal analysis revealed rapid attenuation of initially positive associations, but also some indications of so-called “sleeper effects” emerged in late elementary school for working memory. Implications for research and policy are discussed.

  Abstract
                    <p>One of the most prevalent features of digital mathematics textbooks, compared to traditional ones, is the provision of automated feedback on students’ solutions. Since feedback is regarded as an important factor that influences learning, this is often seen as an affordance of digital mathematics textbooks. While there is a large body of mainly quantitative research on the effectiveness of feedback in general, very little is known about how feedback actually affects students’ individual content specific learning processes and conceptual development. A theoretical framework based on Rabardel’s theory of the instrument and Vergnaud’s theory of conceptual fields is developed to study qualitatively how feedback actually functions in the learning process. This framework was applied in a case study of two elementary school students’ learning processes when working on a probability task from a German 3rd grade digital textbook. The analysis allowed detailed reconstruction of how students made sense of the information provided by the feedback and adjusted their behavior accordingly. This in-depth analysis unveiled that feedback does not necessarily foster conceptual development in the desired way, and a correct solution does not always coincide with conceptual understanding. The results point to some obstacles that students face when working individually on tasks from digital mathematics textbooks with automated feedback, and indicate that feedback needs to be developed in design-based research cycles in order to yield the desired effects.</p>

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 3, Page 708-755, September 2021. <br>Several new statistical tools and analytical frameworks have been recently developed to measure countries’ and sectors’ involvement in global value chains. Such a wealth of methodologies reflects the fact that different empirical questions call for distinct accounting methods and different levels of aggregation of trade flows. In this article, we describe icio, a new command for the computation of the most appropriate measures of trade in value added as well as participation in global value chains. icio follows the conceptual framework proposed by Borin and Mancini (2019, Policy Research Working Paper WPS 8804; WDR 2020 Background Paper, World Bank Group), which in turn extends, refines, and reconciles the other main contributions in this strand of the literature. icio is flexible enough to work with any intercountry input–output table and with any level of aggregation of trade flows.

The command allows the user to apply the classic RRM model introduced in Chorus (2010, European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research 10: 181–196), the generalized RRM model introduced in Chorus (2014, Transportation Research, Part B 68: 224–238), and also the µRRM and pure RRM models, both introduced in van Cranenburgh, Guevara, and Chorus (2015, Transportation Research, Part A 74: 91–109). We illustrate the use of the randregret command by using stated choice data on route preferences. The command offers robust and cluster standarderror correction using analytical expressions of the score functions. It also offers likelihood-ratio tests that can be used to assess the relevance of a given model specification. Finally, users can obtain the predicted probabilities from each model by using the randregretpred command.

Specifically, rwrmed estimates interventional direct and indirect effects in the presence of treatment-induced confounding by fitting models for 1) the conditional mean of the mediator given the treatment and a set of baseline confounders and 2) the conditional mean of the outcome given the treatment, mediator, baseline confounders, and a set of treatment-induced confounders that have been residualized with respect to the observed past. Interventional direct and indirect effects are simple functions of the parameters in these models when they are correctly specified and when there are no unobserved variables that confound the treatment-outcome, treatment-mediator, or mediator-outcome relationships. When no treatment-induced confounders are specified, rwrmed produces natural direct and indirect effect estimates.

(2016, Advances in Econometrics: Vol. 36—Essays in Honor of Aman Ullah, 85–135): the cross-sectionally augmented distributed lag and the cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag estimator. As a third alternative, I review an error-correction model in the presence of cross-sectional dependence. Second, I explain how to estimate the exponent of cross-sectional dependence using xtcse2 following Bailey, Kapetanios, and Pesaran (2016, Journal of Applied Econometrics 31: 929–960; 2019, Sankhyā 81: 46–102).

  Abstract
                  <p>Formulas are involved in most parts of the mathematical curriculum in upper secondary education and in everyday mathematics classrooms, but research shows that students have difficulties using formulas adequately. When students are presented with a task, the task activates a conceptual frame in the students, making them perceive formulas in a specific way, thereby affecting their mathematical behaviour. In this paper, building ideal types of patterns of mathematical behaviours is used to conceptualise ‘view on formula’ specified by several specific views. The concept of ‘view on formula’ is applied in an analysis of a classroom episode pointing to reasons for the difficulties students have with handling formulas. When views are either missing or not used in a flexible way this can lead to an unsuccessful handling of formulas. Also, students’ views on formula may indicate what knowledge is missing for solving a task involving formulas. Taken together, this points to the importance of paying attention to views on formulas in the everyday mathematics classroom.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>While curricular change often begins with a new textbook, its eventual enactment in the hands of individual teachers depends on their orientation towards the curriculum and its representation in the textbook. Studying this teacher-textbook relationship is crucial for understanding how curricular reform intended by textbook designers is likely to be implemented in individual classrooms. We have been studying this by means of didactic tagging—a methodology where teachers assign metadata to textbook tasks. Categories of metadata include both descriptive aspects of tasks and aspects of their envisioned enactment. Prior research has focused on characteristics of the textbook that emerge as patterns in metadata that persist across multiple taggers. In the current study we turn our attention to individual differences across taggers. Four teachers tagged tasks that comprise an entire pre-calculus high school textbook. Analysis generated non-trivial findings regarding each tagger’s interaction with the textbook, in the form of individual patterns in the tagged metadata. These patterns allowed us to put forth tentative “profiles” of each of the four teachers’ interactions with the textbook. We propose this as a method for investigating and assessing teachers’ didactic orientations, and for predicting aspects of their enactment of textbook curricula, while avoiding time-consuming and intrusive observation of classroom teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we explore theoretical approaches to Japanese teachers’ lesson designs involving the adaptation of mathematics textbooks for instructional change. In Japan, although most teachers use textbooks as the main resource for lesson planning, called kyouzai kenkyuu, the ways in which they use textbooks can differ. In a kyouzai kenkyuu practice, Japanese teachers sometimes attempt to design innovative tasks and/or learning trajectories beyond or parallel to the textbooks and curriculum guidelines. Such practice is often invisible to international researchers, since it is culturally situated in the local context. To make it more visible, in this study we address and advance theoretical approaches using two frameworks which are well-established for research in mathematics education, namely, Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD) and Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD). Two cases of lesson design regarding fractions using the same textbook chapter for 3rd graders in primary schools in Japan, are used as examples to illustrate crucial elements of each framework and ways of combining and coordinating both frameworks. As a result, we conceptualise teachers’ kyouzai kenkyuu practice using two approaches: from a praxeological analysis based on ATD, the difference in teachers’ mathematical and didactic knowledge was emphasised, while within DAD, the difference in the instrumentalisation process was emphasised. This analysis implies that the two theoretical approaches can be compatible, and used to gain deeper insight into the relationship between lesson design using the textbook and teacher knowledge.</p>
