  Abstract
                  <p>In mathematics classrooms, educators encourage both creativity and collaboration. In the current study we investigated the dialogical moves that made up the interactions of three groups of post high-school students who worked on an open-ended mathematics task. The aim of this study was to characterize collective strategic pathways that can lead to different creativity products, and the possible impact of leadership styles and dialogical moves on those pathways. Collective strategic flexibility was defined as the number of strategies used by the group. Three strategy paths were found, namely, a disjointed strategy path, an emerging strategy path, and a straightforward strategy path. Dialogical moves such as asking for help, receiving clarifications, and explicating strategies, led to fluency. Elaborating mathematical explanations led to originality. Strategic flexibility was supported by evaluating strategies. Group leadership styles also contributed to varying amounts of cooperation and collaboration, in turn furthering different aspects of creativity. Findings indicated that cooperative collectives can lead to original unpredictable solutions. When a group is more collaborative, collective strategic flexibility may increase. When there is a mix, and students collaborate in a way that ensures that all can contribute, then collective fluency is promoted.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports from a case study which explores kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction in a teaching–learning activity about reflection symmetry. From a dialectical perspective, abstraction is here conceived as a process, as a genuine part of human activity, where the learner establishes “a point of view from which the concrete can be seen as meaningfully related” (van Oers &amp; Poland Mathematics Education Research Journal, 19(2), 10–22, 2007, p. 13–14). A cultural-historical semiotic perspective to embodiment is used to explore the characteristics of kindergarten children’s mathematical abstraction. In the selected segment, two 5-year-old boys explore the concept of reflection symmetry using a doll pram. In the activity, the two boys first point to concrete features of the sensory manifold, then one of the boys’ awareness gradually moves to the imagined and finally to grasping a general and establishing a new point of view. The findings illustrate the essential role of gestures, bodily actions, and rhythm, in conjunction with spoken words, in the two boys’ gradual process of grasping a general. The study advances our knowledge about the nature of mathematical abstraction and challenges the traditional view on abstraction as a sort of decontextualised higher order thinking. This study argues that abstraction is not a matter of going from the concrete to the abstract, rather it is an emergent and context-bound process, as a genuine part of children’s concrete embodied activities.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>From the socio-critical perspective of mathematical modeling, reflexive discussions about the nature, criteria, and consequences of mathematical models are not a natural consequence of modeling in school. This report is part of a larger study focused on stimulating reflexive discussions in practice employing constructivist grounded theory as a research method. Twenty-seven college algebra students engaged in a 3-week modeling project at a community college in the USA. Audio-recorded group discussions and written reflections were collected to determine how reflexive discussions were taking place. Analysis of students’ actions and reflexive discussions during the modeling project produced four concepts: voicing mathematics, personalizing mathematics, challenging mathematics, and negotiating mathematics. These concepts are integrated into an overall process for stimulating reflexive discussions and are conceptualized as unboxing mathematics. The overarching concept of unboxing mathematics represents one interpretation of how reflexive discussions may be constituted during modeling activities and identifies classroom mathematical practices specific to the socio-critical modeling context of this study.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study aims to explore teacher noticing differences of the sampled US and Chinese elementary teachers from cross-cultural mathematics videos. A total of 34 expert teachers commented on 25 video clips online. We coded what and how teachers noticed from the videos both quantitatively and qualitatively. Findings reveal teachers’ strong interests and profound reflections, especially in the teaching domain including representations, communication, and teacher questioning/guide. Cross-cultural differences in teacher noticing were identified, which were discussed based on possible cultural influences. Implications in research and practice, teacher support, and methodology are discussed.</p>

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 999-1020, December 2021. <br>We present a new command, radf, that tests for explosive behavior in time series. The command computes the right-tail augmented Dickey and Fuller (1979, Journal of the American Statistical Association 74: 427–431) unitroot test and its further developments based on supremum statistics derived from augmented Dickey–Fuller-type regressions estimated using recursive windows (Phillips, Wu, and Yu, 2011, International Economic Review 52: 201–226) and recursive flexible windows (Phillips, Shi, and Yu, 2015, International Economic Review 56: 1043–1078). It allows for the lag length in the test regression and the width of rolling windows to be either specified by the user or determined using data-dependent procedures, and it performs the date-stamping procedures advocated by Phillips, Wu, and Yu (2011) and Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015) to identify episodes of explosive behavior. It also implements the wild bootstrap proposed by Phillips and Shi (2020, Handbook of Statistics: Financial, Macro and Micro Econometrics Using R, Vol. 42, 61–80) to lessen the potential effects of unconditional heteroskedasticity and account for the multiplicity issue in recursive testing. The use of radf is illustrated with an empirical example.

However, there have been growing calls to replace Cronbach’s α with measures that have more defensible assumptions. One of the most common and straightforward recommended reliability estimates is ω. After a review of reliability and its estimation in Stata, I introduce the community-contributed command omegacoef. This command reports McDonald’s ω in a format similar to the base alpha command. omegacoef provides Stata users the ability to easily compute estimates of reliability with the confidence that the necessary statistical assumptions are met.

The relative distribution is the distribution of the relative ranks that the outcomes from one distribution take on in another distribution. The methodology can be used, for example, to compare the distribution of wages between men and women. The presented software, reldist, estimates the relative cumulative distribution and the relative density, as well as the relative polarization, divergence, and other summary measures of the relative ranks. It also provides functionality such as location and shape decompositions or covariate balancing. Statistical inference is implemented in terms of influence functions and supports estimation for complex samples.

The command allows the user to model selection in quantile regressions by using either a Gaussian or a one-dimensional Frank copula. We illustrate the use of qregsel with two examples. First, we apply the method to the fictional dataset used in the Stata Base Reference Manual for the heckman command. Second, we replicate part of the empirical application of the original article using data for the United Kingdom that cover the period 1978–2000 to compare wages of males and females at different quantiles.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 853-884, December 2021. <br>Many studies estimate the impact of exposure to some quasiexperimental policy or event using a panel event study design. These models, as a generalized extension of “difference-in-differences” designs or two-way fixed-effects models, allow for dynamic leads and lags to the event of interest to be estimated, while also controlling for fixed factors (often) by area and time. In this article, we discuss the setup of the panel event study design in a range of situations and lay out several practical considerations for its estimation. We describe a command, eventdd, that allows for simple estimation, inference, and visualization of event study models in a range of circumstances. We then provide several examples to illustrate eventdd’s use and flexibility, as well as its interaction with various native Stata commands, and other relevant community-contributed commands such as reghdfe and boottest.

This assumption is likely to be violated in the presence of stratified hazards, which is noted in estat phtest’s help file. We provide a wrapper command, stratph, that implements a straightforward modification to the residual-based diagnostic that corrects for the potential assumption violation. We use the stratified hazards example from the stcox help file to demonstrate the stratph command’s workings.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 4, Page 972-998, December 2021. <br>In this article, we present commands to enable fixing the value of the correlation between the unobservables in Heckman models. These commands can solve two practical issues. First, for situations in which a valid exclusion restriction is not available, these commands enable exploring how the results could be affected by sample-selection bias. Second, stepping through values of this correlation can verify whether the global maximum of the likelihood function has been found. We provide several commands to fit these and related models with a fixed value of the correlation between the unobservables.
