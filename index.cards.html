  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This article uses 30 years of investigatory and special reports by the American Association of University Professors’ Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure to understand how retrenchment and restructuring practices have been enacted on ways detrimental to both individual and the corporate faculty. Informed by changes in the logics in higher education and broader understandings of retrenchment, we identified larger patterns of where retrenchment and restructuring in violation of academic norms took place. We further identified three main themes in the reports: Declaring Exigency and / or Launching Restructuring, Faculty Roles and Rights during Retrenchment/Restructuring, and Criteria Used in Removing Faculty. Together, they demonstrate how faculty were excluded from decisions to declare financial exigency or undertake restructuring, denied meaningful roles in enacting changes once exigency or restructuring had been announced, were targeted for removal in violation of tenure rights, and were denied academic due process.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>As COVID-19 shuttered schools, it created widespread student and family needs and exacerbated challenges stemming from long-standing racial and economic inequities. Here, we examine how an evidenced-based, integrated student support intervention responded to systematically identify and address the academic and nonacademic needs of students and families in 94 high-poverty, urban schools. We conduct thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses about intervention personnel’s work in spring 2020 and triangulate findings with descriptive analyses of service provision records and mid-spring estimates of crucial needs. We find that intervention schools developed specific processes to respond to immediate needs, which included resource, academic, and socioemotional support. To accomplish this, the intervention leveraged existing processes and relationships to maintain intervention-specific practices, facilitate referrals and connections to resources, and expand direct intervention for education stakeholders. Findings elucidate practices for meeting academic and nonacademic needs that affect student learning and that may arise in future schooling disruptions.

  Abstract
                  <p>Argu
      mentative problem solving in mathematics classrooms is a crucial practice that supports important student learning goals via collaborative deliberation and consensus building, but also places substantial cognitive and affective demands on both students and teacher. In this in-depth qualitative study, we considered how students’ emotions during argumentative discourse relate to their learning of real-life functional situations, an area of mathematics highlighted in the literature as foundational yet difficult. Observations, written reflections, and interviews of six Year 9 (14–15-year-old) students’ experience of argument construction, critique, and consensus building were analyzed for insights into emotions experienced during small-group argumentative problem solving, and how various emotions might support or hinder students’ mathematics learning. The emotion of frustration was experienced frequently and was found to facilitate persistence and the correction of misconceptions, but also to hinder the learning in contributing to ongoing tension and eventual resignation. Peer critique was found to stimulate negative emotions but positive learning processes, such as seeking other ways to explain one’s reasoning, and re-evaluating one’s own incorrect solutions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As a Canadian mathematics educator, I have a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters. After all, to me, Canadian mathematics education matters. Knowing this little factoid, imagine my horror when it recently dawned on me that, no matter where I looked during this COVID-19 pandemic, all I saw was flippant treatment towards the metric system. As I detail in this article, COVID-19 social distancing signage, here in Canada, presents indifference towards the metric system. For shame, Canada. For shame. For the record, despite what nearly all the signs around us say at the moment, 2 m is not 6 ft. And, while I am at it, also for the record, 6 ft is not 2 m. Whether it is small business, big business or even the different levels of Canadian government (i.e., municipal, provincial or federal), it does not matter, the metric system is being poorly presented here at home during this global pandemic. The only good news, I am numb to it all now, which has helped me move on and start looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters. Stay tuned.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Volume 58, Issue 6, Page 1107-1141, December 2021. <br>This critical race ethnography examines a secondary-level dual-language (DL) program, a bilingual-education model thought to provide Latinxs educational equity. Drawing from a three-stage recursive analytic approach, I present evidence that a DL program’s policies and practices valued offering Latinx youth biliterate schooling only so long as DL was available and advantageous to Whites—which ultimately excluded some Latinx students from bilingual education and/or accessing its benefits. I theorize DL functions as white property when DL perpetuates racial hierarchies and preserves the value of a white racial identity, thereby maintaining Whites’ inequitable material accumulation. I problematize the logic of DL—highlighting that DL has the elitist tendencies of world-language education—and assess DL’s potential to deliver educational justice to Latinxs.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>To investigate how prompts shape preservice teachers’ reflections, we examined, in this exploratory case study, the written reflections responding to three types of prompts (standard-based, concept-based, and task-based) of 21 preservice teachers in an online technology integration class. We analyzed these reflections at the sentence level (total 1,503 comments), both quantitatively and qualitatively, using a framework comprising descriptive, rationalistic, and anticipatory dimensions to understand the compositions of reflections generated from each type of prompt and the kinds of teacher abilities demonstrated in each dimension. We found quantitative patterns between prompt types and the reflections generated and emergent themes in each dimension of reflection relating to teacher abilities. We conclude by discussing three prompt design features that appeared to have played an important role in shaping the reflections and suggesting implications and future research directions.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent innovations in professional development are rife with a wide array of efforts focused on teacher collaboration. In this essay, we address some of the unexamined assumptions about the nature and significance of interactions in teacher professional collaboration, drawing on the concept of the “fourth wall” from theater and film studies. The fourth wall is a term used to describe the invisible wall that separates actors from their audience. We use this metaphor to interrogate the function of the fourth wall in professional learning and argue that it reflects a culture of professional learning that, despite innovations that tout teacher collaboration, upholds isolation in teaching and teacher learning and deep embedded norms of noninterference in one another’s practice. We also attend to the possibilities for supporting teacher learning that breaching the fourth wall affords when shared enactments of practice are used as a context for teachers’ sensemaking and collaboration.

The analysis included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their suggestions for supporting students’ further learning. While the findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of mathematical learning, their analyses of students’ thinking and their ideas for supporting students’ learning lacked sophistication. Also, there was considerable divergence between the students’ thinking as evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs’ suggested support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for teacher education.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The underrepresentation and underperformance of men of color relative to women of color within institutions of higher education have been extensively studied the past 20 years. The purpose of this study is to understand trends in how this research has been conducted rather than understand “best practices” to support this student population. To achieve this, we reviewed 153 pieces of scholarship from 1999 to 2019 using an intersectional and critical content analysis approach. Findings revealed that the bulk of scholarship involved onetime interviews for its empirical foundations, and the overwhelming majority centered the racial experiences of Black and Latinx men. In contrast, few analyses critically explored gender, sexual orientation, or social class. Additionally, scholarship that centered Asian American, Indigenous, multiracial, and trans* men of color was scant or nonexistent. Given these large gaps in the knowledge base, we offer guidance for the next generation of men of color in higher education scholarship in terms of analytical foci, theoretical frameworks, and methodologies.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>While the COVID-19 pandemic affected the education of nearly all schoolchildren worldwide, pandemic-related school closures did not affect all children in equal ways. Between March and August, 2020, I interviewed 31 parents of children with disabilities as part of a larger interview study of U.S. parents of children in grades K–12. In this article, I analyze these parents’ narratives about their families’ experiences of pandemic-related remote learning to identify the particular challenges children with disabilities and their families faced with remote learning. I find that most, but not all, families struggled with remote learning, both when children’s specific needs while learning at home differed from their needs at school, and when schools failed to provide adequate accommodations and services remotely. These narratives demonstrate how children with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to the type of large-scale systemic shock to U.S. public education that the pandemic has presented.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This critical qualitative study explores Hispanic-serving institutions’ (HSIs) pursuit of racialized federal funds and theorizes the connection between grant seeking and servingness at HSIs. Specifically, the study’s guiding research question was: Why do HSIs pursue racialized Title V funding? Based on interviews with 23 institutional actors at 12 HSIs, including public Hispanic-serving community colleges and both public and private 4-year institutions, the findings suggest that HSIs vie for Title V grants for assorted and, at times, conflicting reasons. Specifically, they seek this racialized funding to (a) pool money, (b) address broad-based institutional needs, (c) signal legitimacy, and (d) support all students. Importantly, some of the reasons have little to do with immediately serving students generally or Latinx students more specifically. Thus, I argue that in their race-evasive pursuit of Title V funds, many HSIs capitalize on their Latinx students, rendering serving into $erving and ghosting the “H” and “S” in HSIs.

  Abstract
                  <p>Prior studies have identified the impact beliefs have on mathematics instructors’ instructional practice, such as their choice to (or not to) lecture. However, the role of instructional context role in influencing beliefs and instruction has not been thoroughly researched. This paper explores how course context and beliefs could impact mathematics instructors’ propensity to lecture by investigating two very different instructional contexts in undergraduate mathematics in the United States: Calculus and Abstract Algebra. The results of our regression analyses were significant in both data sets and, we did find beliefs in each context that predicted the amount of time spent lecturing. For instance, the more calculus instructors believed in the effectiveness of teacher-centered instructional practices, the more likely they were to lecture. Whereas the more abstract algebra instructors believed in their student’s capacity to learn the less likely they were to lecture. However, while the regression model for the abstract algebra instructors accounted for 37.8% of the variability in the reported amount of time spent lecturing, the model for Calculus instructors only accounted for 2.7% of the variability. Thus our analyses indicate that there are contextual differences, such as course coordination, student demographics, and the job security of the instructors, that may be mitigating the extent to which beliefs impact instructional practice.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Participating in discussions of classroom video can support teachers to attend to student thinking. Central to the success of these discussions is how teachers interpret the activity they are engaged in—how teachers frame what they are doing. In asynchronous online environments, negotiating framing poses challenges, given that interactions are not in real time and often require written text. We present findings from an online course designed to support teachers to frame video discussions as making sense of student thinking. In an engineering pedagogy course designed to emphasize responsiveness to students’ thinking, we documented shifts in teachers’ framing, with teachers more frequently making sense of, rather than evaluating, student thinking later in the course. These findings show that it is possible to design an asynchronous online course to productively engage teachers in video discussions and inform theory development in online teacher education.
