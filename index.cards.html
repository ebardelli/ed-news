  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>In their recently renamed theory, situated expectancy-value theory (SEVT), Eccles and Wigfield (2020) emphasized the importance of situations in influencing individuals’ motivational beliefs and academic choices. Adopting a novel approach—network analysis—this study aimed to examine how situations may impact the associations among expectancies, subjective task values, and achievement from a holistic perspective. In this study, situations were operationalized as grade levels (i.e., 6th –9th grade), subject domains (i.e., language arts and math), and countries (i.e., Finland and Germany). Adolescents from Finland (N = 4,062) and Germany (N = 449) were included in the study. Results showed that, overall, the networks are mostly subject bound, yearly varied, and country specific, supporting the situative nature of SEVT. We also found that expectancies were consistently the closest motivational beliefs to achievement, whereas utility values were the least close, implying that expectancies, not utility, might be the most desirable intervention targets for achievement improvement.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper examines coin-toss comparison questions from two recent studies involving undergraduate students and high school teachers and connects to findings from two prior studies in the literature. Considering possible sample spaces employed by participants, this is a reflection on whether one sequence could be more likely depending on the interpretation of the question. To critique the choice of sequences and determine possible scenarios in which one sequence may be more likely than the other, three alternative sample spaces were explored. It was determined that different sample spaces can lead to one sequence being more likely to occur than the other. Further evaluation discusses whether alternative sample spaces may have been utilised by the participants in each of the studies, and hence, the paper concludes with an advocacy to enquire deeper into participants’ reasoning when investigating coin-toss questions.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Research on teacher churn has produced conflicting conclusions as to its impact on students and teachers. We bring clarity to this work by combining and expanding on analytical approaches used in earlier research to determine how and when different types of churn (i.e., grade, school) impact teacher effectiveness and attendance. Using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District, our results suggest differences based on analytical approach but ultimately show that changing schools and grades may be less of an issue than previously reported. In addition, in the case of school churn, a beneficial match in their new school sites may matter more for teacher outcomes than potential disruptive effects of churn. We conclude with implications for policy and future research.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 1, Page 62-63, September 2022. <br> The biggest threat to an equitable and prosperous American society is not a particular educational policy, but the gravitational pull of politics, explains Jonathan Collins. Before educational policy can be developed and put into place, the politics that drive education must be acknowledged and addressed. Violence is erupting at school board meetings across the country over mask mandates, book bans, and critical race theory. Meanwhile, as has been the case throughout U.S. history, the political division and vitriol distract us from ensuring that our most vulnerable children are getting needed academic support. It is time, Collins says, for a politics of solutions that can defy the gravitational pull of politics that sidetrack leaders addressing the real problems students face.

James responds to a March 2022 Kappan article in which high school student Colin McGrath warned his younger brother of the burden that pointless homework assignments will play in his life when he enters high school. James suggests that, although some teachers may assign work with little value, most assignments do serve to either reinforce or expand on what students have learned in class. She urges teachers and students to think of homework as opportunities for learning at home. Ideally, teachers will explain the purpose of any at-home learning and give students options for engaging in such learning, using their individual intelligences to master the content.

Shannon review research from before and during the pandemic to learn what makes teachers likely to leave the profession and share results from their May 2022 survey of 830 teachers. Around three-fourths of teachers surveyed had considered leaving their positions during the 2022-23 school year, with more than half considering positions outside education. Teachers describe the increased workload, ongoing stress, and lack of support from administrators and parents as factors that led them to consider leaving.

Sullivan provide insight into what it will take to keep Black teachers in the profession. The interviews depict both the anti-Blackness that Black teachers face and their freedom dreams for a better tomorrow for their students. Ultimately, Black teachers want schools to be transformed into healing-centered spaces where they can show up authentically to create a world in which Blackness is centered and affirmed.

Some teachers have reported that they have considered leaving the profession because of a lack of advancement opportunities. Jennifer Wu-Pope explains how research-practice partnerships can play a role in retaining these teachers while leveraging their expertise in educational improvement efforts. Participation in research-practice partnerships could be offered as a professional advancement track option for teachers. Providing that option as a hybrid position in which teachers remain in the classroom for part of their day while using the rest of their time for research can be one way to address dissatisfaction among high-performing teachers.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Given the scarcity of comprehensive review studies in the literature, this bibliometric analysis thrives on taking a scientific approach to delivering quantitative and qualitative information on the ever-evolving field of ESG. Utilizing the performance analysis and science mapping techniques which includes citation analysis, co-word analysis, the study reports a holistic overview of 693 (ESG) papers from 1991 to 2020. The paper aims to provide a unified perspective on the evolution and further identify future research directions in this field. The findings point to the most important countries, authors, studies, and top journals in this field. Results show that published articles on ESG gained momentum after 2006; however, an exponential rise is being observed in the past 5 years, with research focusing on sustainable finance, sustainable development, ESG, and CSR with themes extending to risk management, stakeholder engagement, and portfolio construction, among others. Furthermore, the research identifies how the practice of ESG reporting affects many variables such as financial performance, social performance, environmental performance, and sustainability score. The findings also indicate that the field of ESG is still evolving, with numerous unexplored themes. The work is novel and relevant on the pretext that it uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases for bibliometric mapping, whereas previous studies have used the Scopus database but have lacked a robust methodology, so the findings of this study provided strong support for identifying emerging paradigms in the ESG literature.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background: Evaluation of public programs has undergone many changes over the past four decades since Peter Rossi coined his “Iron Law” of program evaluation: “The expected value of any net impact assessment of any large-scale social program is zero.” While that assessment may be somewhat overstated, the essence still holds. The failures far outnumber the successes, and the estimated favorable effects are rarely sizeable. Findings: Despite this grim assessment, much can be learned from “failed” experiments, and from ones that are successful in only some sites or subgroups. Advances in study design, statistical models, data, and how inferences are drawn from estimates have substantially improved our analyses and will continue to do so. However, the most actual learning about “what works” (and why, when, and where) is likely to come from gathering more detailed and comprehensive data on how the intervention was implemented and attempting to link that data to estimated impacts. Researchers need detailed data on the target population served, the content of the intervention, and the process by which it is delivered to participating service providers and individuals. Two examples presented here illustrate how researchers drew useful broader lessons from impact estimates for a set of related programs. Conclusion: Rossi posited three reasons most interventions fail—wrong question, wrong intervention, poor implementation. Speeding the accumulation of wisdom about how social programs can best help vulnerable populations will require that researchers work closely with program funders, developers, operators, and participants to gather and interpret these detailed data about program implementation.

Shelby Clark and Madora Soutter describe how growth mindsets are related to, yet distinct from, intellectual risk-taking and share strategies for fostering both in students. The strategies come from their yearlong research project observing classes and interviewing students and teachers at a high school that uses a discussion-based pedagogy known as the Harkness method.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 1, Page 58-59, September 2022. <br> As new school leaders take over the district’s top jobs this fall, they and their communities face transitions. Joshua P. Starr explains that too many leaders focus on entry and fail to engage in a thoughtful and comprehensive transition process. Transition isn’t just about change; it’s also about loss. Organizational transition is about how people respond to these changed circumstances. Even if people are ready and eager to embrace the new beginning, they still lose their old way of doing business. For those who resist the new or are just unsure of what it means for them, their sense of loss can manifest in active opposition to a leader’s new ideas. A good transition process involves the creation of a transition team with committees made up of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and community members, who will be more likely to support plans that come from their work.

Makin, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, if a state offers tuition assistance for students to attend private schools, then requiring that those private schools be nonsectarian violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Robert Kim discusses how this case aligns with other decisions related to the free exercise of religion as it applies to public schools and what it could mean for schools going forward. Carson v. Makin, he explains, is one of several cases that open the door for states to fund religious education. At the same time, recent cases show that these schools may be allowed to discriminate against students and teachers while continuing to receive state funds.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created situations where all the decisions educators make are fraught, and unhappy members of the public have been quick to air their frustrations, even as the PDK Poll indicates that the public is more satisfied with local schools than ever. The September 2022 issue of Kappan explores the circumstances making education especially challenging and suggests solutions.

The pandemic likely will continue to exact a toll on the mental health of the teaching workforce. A silver lining from COVID-19 could come from teacher stress research conducted during the pandemic, which provides directions for how to improve the occupational lives of teachers. To this end, Christopher McCarthy, Madison Blaydes, Caroline H. Weppner, &amp; Richard G. Lambert briefly review how teacher stress is defined, how it was exacerbated by the pandemic, and what can be done to alleviate it and promote wellness going forward.

The district’s progressive and anti-racist stance led many white educators to assume that their colleagues did not experience interpersonal or institutional racism. However, when Doris Santoro, Julia Hazel, and Alberto Morales interviewed educators throughout the district they found that experiences of racism were pervasive. Knowing that white educators might tend to deny that reality and not wanting to further burden the district’s educators of color with sharing their trauma or observing their colleagues’ ignorance, they undertook a deliberate process to share their findings in ways that considered the needs of all educators in the system.
