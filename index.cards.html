  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The authors present a systematic review of elementary school universal school-based (USB) social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions from 2008 through 2020 for two groups of minoritized students in education research and practice: students with disabilities and/or minoritized racial identities. Completed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards, in this review the authors identified 269 studies for inclusion, which reflected 107 USB SEL interventions. Eleven studies explicitly excluded students with disabilities. Studies varied widely in how disability and racial identity were categorized within and across studies and provided limited evidence of effectiveness through the use of subgroup analyses to support meaningful assessment of how students with disabilities and racially minoritized elementary school age students are benefiting from USB SEL interventions. The authors discuss the limitations of findings, education research best practices, and the minimum reporting standards necessary to ensure ability and racially minoritized youth representation in future USB SEL research.

  Abstract
                  <p>While many aspects of the teaching and learning of specific advanced mathematics courses have been studied, limited work has examined mathematical themes like sameness or its instantiations across disciplines. In this paper, we explore algebraists’ collective example space for mathematical sameness. We used qualitative methods to analyze survey responses from 197 algebraists in order to identify specific mathematical concepts that the algebraists associated with sameness and relevant factors to consider when determining sameness of objects. Using variation theory, we introduce the notion of a community example space for algebraists to highlight specific dimensions of variation in sameness as well as the range of variation for each dimension through specific instantiations given by multiple participants. Dimensions of sameness included contexts, concepts, objects, properties, and qualities. These results suggest potential for building connections across levels and branches of mathematics by highlighting how different choices for each dimension of sameness can produce different instantiations of sameness.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we present a theoretical discussion on how problems issued from discrete mathematics can develop the attitudes, skills, and knowledge required for scientific mathematical activity in the classroom. We do so via the research situation for the classroom model by performing mathematical and didactical analyses of a problem issued from discrete geometry, and we present the results of a preliminary experiment conducted with Chilean students between the ages of 11 and 13. Our chosen problem asked students to tile a fixed square with a finite number of smaller squares. From the theoretical analysis and the preliminary experimentation, we conclude that this problem, and problems issued from discrete mathematics in general, can induce genuine mathematical activity in lower-secondary school students. In particular, we conclude that this problem is effective in developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes advocated in the Chilean mathematics curriculum.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Emotions play an essential role in pre-service teachers’ competence development, particularly in mathematics. However, the emotion of shame in mathematics has been largely neglected so far. This article deals with shameful experiences of pre-service primary school teachers during their mathematical education at school and the various effects of shame on their decision to study mathematics as a subject at university. The research consists of a qualitative and a quantitative study with 311 prospective primary school teachers who responded to a survey about their experiences of shame in mathematics at school when they were students. Results of the qualitative study emphasize the different experiences in mathematics during the school years and reveal the characteristics of these situations, for example, social exposure or competition games. In the quantitative study, pre-service primary teachers’ subject choice was analyzed in relation to their experienced shame in mathematics at school. Results reveal that shame experienced at school has effects on the initial choice in favor of mathematics at university. Implications for primary teacher education are finally discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Affect (e.g., beliefs, attitudes, emotions) plays a crucial role in mathematics learning, but reliance on verbal and written responses (from surveys, interviews, etc.) limits students’ expression of their affective states. As a complement to existing methods that rely on verbal reports, we explore how graphing can be used to study affect during mathematical experiences. We analyze three studies that used graphing to represent, stimulate recall, and reflect on affect. In each, students were asked to draw their perception of an affective construct, such as confidence or intensity of emotion, against time. The studies differed in participant populations, target affect, timescales of participant experience, and structural features of the graphs. The affordances of graphing include reduced dependence on verbal data, temporal ordering of participants’ recollections, explicit representation of change over time, and the creation of objects (the graph) for discussion. These studies as examples show that well-structured graphing can productively supplement existing methods for studying affect in mathematics education, as a different medium through which students can communicate their experience.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Family separation policies’ impacts on children’s education and well-being are critical issues of our time. This paper argues through ethnographic study that although im/migrant parents believed in the promise of a better life for their children as they migrated, COVID-19 and remote schooling contributed to a breakdown in structures of care once they were in the United States. Thus, the experience of remote schooling during 2020 was a difficult task for parents and children who were already dealing with the trauma of detention or separation at the border. Ultimately, we argue that to understand the educational experiences of im/migrant parents and children in the United States, we must consider a multiple disruptions framework. The findings in this article reveal the layered consequences that broader immigration policy has on the everyday educational lives of im/migrant children and their parents.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The globalization of commercial exchanges and capital movements reveal new ways of obtaining value in economic activities, and the differences in the tax burden of companies, depending on where they reside, have become threats for countries to exercise the right to tax business profits generated in its jurisdiction. This problem, together with tax competition between countries, causes a transfer of tax bases towards countries with lower tax rates and tax havens. The lack of agreement in the international community on how to find a solution to the problems has caused several countries to choose to establish special taxes for certain activities of multinational companies in their jurisdictions, resulting in inefficient taxes. This paper analyzes the agreement reached in October 2021 in the G20 and in the OECD in which measures are adopted within the BEPS project to prevent the erosion of tax bases in market jurisdictions promoted by multinational companies. After studying different aspects, we found fundamental reasons for not having an optimistic view on the effective solution to the problems above: unrealistic forecasts on the amount of the new estimated tax bases for Pillar 1 and the high administration and compliance costs. In conclusion, it is not foreseeable that the tax bases derived from the provision of digital services will suffer a territorial redistribution. We do not expect that a minimum tax rate of 15% in corporate tax will be carried out effectively or that the benefits that are transferred to tax havens will be significantly reduced.

  Abstract
                  <p>An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence, attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary classrooms.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Longitudinal data analysis has been widely employed to examine between-individual differences in within-individual changes. One challenge of such analyses is that the rate-of-change is only available indirectly when change patterns are nonlinear with respect to time. Latent change score models (LCSMs), which can be employed to investigate the change in rate-of-change at the individual level, have been developed to address this challenge. We extend an existing LCSM with the Jenss–Bayley growth curve and propose a novel expression for change scores that allows for (1) unequally spaced study waves and (2) individual measurement occasions around each wave. We also extend the existing model to estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration (that largely determines the trajectory shape and is viewed as the most important parameter in the Jenss–Bayley model). We present the proposed model by a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. Our simulation study demonstrates that the proposed model can estimate the parameters unbiasedly and precisely and exhibit target confidence interval coverage. The simulation study also shows that the proposed model with the novel expression for the change scores outperforms the existing model. An empirical example using longitudinal reading scores shows that the model can estimate the individual ratio of the growth acceleration and generate individual rate-of-change in practice. We also provide the corresponding code for the proposed model.

  Abstract
                  <p>How can teachers refine their strategies for purposefully engaging students in mathematical discussions when students are working in groups and the teacher enters an ongoing group conversation? In three educational design research cycles, four teachers collaborated with a researcher for one year to analyse, design and evaluate strategies for engaging students in small-group mathematical discussions. The idea of noticing (Mason in Researching your own practice: the discipline of noticing, RoutledgeFalmer, London, 2002; Sherin et al. in Mathematics teacher noticing: seeing through teachers’ eyes, Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, 2011) was used to organize the findings—by paying attention to aspects in the mathematical discussions and interpreting the interactions, teachers could together refine their own actions/responses to better support students’ work. The Inquiry Co-operation Model of Alrø and Skovsmose (Dialogue and learning in mathematics education: intention, reflection, critique, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 2004) was used as a theoretical base for understanding qualities in mathematical discussions. Ehrenfeld and Horn’s (Educ Stud Math 103(7):251–272, 2020) model of initiation-entry-focus-exit and participation was for interpreting and organizing the findings on teachers’ actions. The results show that teachers became more aware of the importance of explicit instructions and their own role as facilitators of mathematical questions to students, by directing specific mathematical questions to all students within the groups. In this article, by going back and forth between what happened in the teachers’ professional development group and in the classrooms, it was possible to simultaneously follow the teachers’ development processes and what changed in students’ mathematical discussions.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Some states have enacted inclusive policies that reduce constraints and uncertainty for undocumented students, potentially changing their academic decisions and postsecondary goals. We explore shifts in continuing undocumented community college students’ course-taking before and after the California DREAM Act, which provided access to state financial aid. We use difference-in-differences comparisons with permanent residents, refugees, and U.S. citizens who were unaffected by these policies to examine policy impacts. After its implementation, continuing students increased their enrollment intensity, primarily in degree-applicable and transferable courses, and decreased coursework in career/technical education. This suggests state financial aid may have broadened postsecondary possibilities and made transfer to a 4-year institution a more viable option for undocumented students. At the same time, access to aid did not increase undocumented students’ credit loads to the level of their peers, underscoring the reality that other constraints continue to shape undocumented students’ participation in higher education.

  Abstract
                    <p>In this study, the authors examined a group of related literatures that used the same large-scale nationally representative dataset with algebra achievement as the outcome to explore why results from the same dataset may differ across studies. More specially, the authors synthesized the extant research literature that utilized data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) to investigate the student-, teacher-, school-, and parent-level characteristics associated with algebra achievement and whether these relationships were consistent across students’ backgrounds (i.e., race/ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and prior achievement). The authors have summarized the results of 21 studies across 2 outcome variables (ninth- and eleventh-grade algebra achievement) using optimal resource theory as a framework to summarize evidence-based practices for improving student outcomes.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Although there is much research exploring students’ covariational reasoning, there is less research exploring the ways students can leverage such reasoning to coordinate more than two quantities. In this paper, we describe a system of covariational relationships as a comprehensive image of how two varying quantities, having the same attribute across different objects, each covary with respect to a third quantity and in relation to each other. We first describe relevant theoretical constructs, including reasoning covariationally to construct relationships between quantities and reasoning covariationally to compare quantities. We then present a conceptual analysis entailing three interrelated activities we conjectured could support students in reasoning covariationally to conceive of a system of covariational relationships and represent the system graphically. We provide results from two teaching experiments with four middle school students engaging in tasks designed with our conceptual analysis in mind. We highlight two different ways students reasoned covariationally compatible with our conceptual analysis. We discuss the implications of our results and provide areas for future research.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In mathematical whole-class discussions, teachers can build on various student ideas and develop these ideas toward mathematical goals. This requires teachers to make sense of their students’ mathematical thinking, which evidently involves mathematical thinking on the teacher’s part. Teacher sense-making of student mathematical thinking has been studied and conceptualized as an aspect of teacher noticing and has also been conceptualized as a mathematical activity. We combine these perspectives to explore the role of teacher mathematical thinking in making sense of student mathematical thinking. In this study, we investigated that role using video-based teacher discussions in a teacher researcher collaboration in which five Dutch high school mathematics teachers and one researcher developed discourse based lessons in cycles of design, enactment, and evaluation. In video-based discussions, they collaboratively reflected on whole-class discussions from the teachers’ own lessons. We analyzed these discussions to explore the mathematical thinking that teachers articulated during sense-making of students’ mathematical thinking and how teachers’ mathematical thinking affected their sense-making. We found five categories concerning the role of teacher mathematical thinking in their sense-making: flexibility, preoccupation, incomprehension, exemplification, and projection. These categories show how both the content and the process of teacher mathematical thinking can support or impede their sense-making. In addition, we found that the teachers often did not articulate explicit mathematical thinking. Our findings suggest that sense-making of students’ mathematical thinking requires teachers to (re-)engage in reflective thinking with regard to the mathematical content as well as the process of their own mathematical thinking.</p>
