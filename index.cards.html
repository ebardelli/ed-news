  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School principals are facing greater challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic than they have ever faced, which has implications for whether they can conduct their work productively and remain in their jobs over the long term. This article draws on a unique, nationally representative, longitudinal panel of K–12 public school principals across the United States to examine principals’ self-reported resource needs and job demands during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as how those resource needs and demands are related to principals’ dissatisfaction and their intention to leave their job. Although principals’ reported resource needs (which increased over time) and teacher shortages were consistently related to dissatisfaction and intention to leave, various other job demands were predictors of dissatisfaction but not the intention to leave. These results have several implications for supporting and retaining principals as well as the teachers they serve.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School rezoning, or redistricting, is the process by which school boards draw and redraw school attendance boundaries. These boundaries are key drivers of racial and economic school segregation but can also work to ameliorate it. Using a critical orientation to narrative policy analysis, this study examined the cultural politics of race and whiteness in an urban school district undergoing school rezoning. Drawing on semistructured interviews with 15 school leaders and community stakeholders, findings provide a lens for school leaders and policymakers to better understand how and to what extent race is imposed in school attendance boundary decisions. Our findings expand current literature on school rezoning by shedding new light on racial narratives embedded within the political process. We conclude with policy and practice implications.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we aimed to capture the characteristics of Chinese high-quality lessons from a lesson structure perspective, specifically addressing the elements of teaching activity and their sequence. Sixteen videotaped middle school mathematics lessons were selected from 224 daily lessons collected from urban districts in five cities located in the east, north, west, south, and center of China, approved by three independent parties (based on the scores of an instruction quality assessment and ratings by two experts). We found the following five common features among most mathematics lessons: (a) most lessons began with a review; (b) pure learning of mathematical knowledge was emphasized; (c) recurrent teaching activities related to mathematics problems ran throughout the lesson; (d) highlighting and summarizing important points during the lesson and summarizing the entire lesson at the end of the class were frequently used; and (e) teaching activities were dense and large in volume. The research findings paint a broad picture of high quality instruction (deepening our understanding of high-quality teaching in different cultures) and provide multiple choices for teachers.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Interest is vital for students’ learning in mathematics. Over the course of the Chinese mathematics curriculum reform in the past 30 years, cultivating students’ positive emotions, attitudes, and values has gained growing attention. In the current study we examined the trajectory of Chinese mathematics textbook development by analyzing textbook content that stimulated students’ mathematics learning interest through the curriculum reform in the past three decades. First, we selected textbooks that represent each phase of the curriculum reform (the Incubation Phase, the Reform Phase, and the Conditioning Phase). Then, taking eighth grade as an example, we used Hidi and Renninger’s model to identify content that focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. Finally, we explored the trajectory of textbook development in this aspect within the scope of curriculum reform. Results show that attention to strategies developing positive emotions and values towards mathematics has been emerging in recent times. Interest-stimulating strategies directed toward the triggering and maintaining of situational interest have been integrated more frequently into textbooks since the Reform Phase, while text content employing strategies that may lead to rote memorization is generally decreasing. Using Chinese curriculum reform as a context, this study demonstrates how mathematics textbooks have been revisioned and revised with a focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. The reform of mathematics education has been successfully implemented in more than thirty provinces in China, despite significant differences in geographical, cultural, and economic development. It is hoped that this study can provide practical evidence of interest stimulation in mathematics for the international education community.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>For preservice LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning) teachers, little is known about their transition from teachers-in-training to professional educators. Understanding their experiences may hold keys to recruiting and retaining a diverse workforce, as well as supporting K-12 students. Rooted in queer theory and subjectivities, this critical narratological study examines a White, gay, novice high school teacher and the stories of his interactions with a White, transgender student, who was part of LGBTQ+ affinity space the participant co-sponsored. Findings demonstrate how social contexts and systems, in combination with the novice teacher’s emerging and morphing perception of professional responsibilities and boundaries were sources of consternation. Often, the participant’s attempts to circumvent, ignore, and/or thwart heteronormative assumptions and practices within the school’s environment related his sense of agency. In turn, this greatly affected much of the teacher’s subjectivities regarding student–teacher relationships. Implications highlight the important role of accompliceship and/or co-conspirators in teacher education programs and schools.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>The give-n task is widely used in developmental psychology to indicate young children’s knowledge or use of the cardinality principle (CP): the last number word used in the counting process indicates the total number of items in a collection. Fuson (1988) distinguished between the CP, which she called the count-cardinal concept, and the cardinal-count concept, which she argued is a more advanced cardinality concept that underlies the counting-out process required by the give-n task with larger numbers. One aim of the present research was to evaluate Fuson’s disputed hypothesis that these two cardinality concepts are distinct and that the count-cardinal concept serves as a developmental prerequisite for constructing the cardinal-count concept. Consistent with Fuson’s hypothesis, the present study with twenty-four 3- and 4-year-olds revealed that success on a battery of tests assessing understanding of the count-cardinal concept was significantly and substantially better than that on the give-n task, which she presumed assessed the cardinal-count concept. Specifically, the results indicated that understanding the count-cardinal concept is a necessary condition for understanding the cardinal-count concept. The key methodological implication is that the widely used give-n task may significantly underestimate children’s understanding of the CP or count-cardinal concept. The results were also consistent with a second aim, which was to confirm that number constancy concepts develop after the count-cardinal concept but before the cardinal-count concept.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>For many decades, problem solving has been a focus of elementary mathematics education reforms. Despite this, in many education systems, the prevalent approach to mathematics problem solving treats it as an isolated activity instead of an integral part of teaching and learning. In this study, two mathematics teacher educators introduced 19 Irish elementary teachers to an alternative problem solving approach, namely Teaching Through Problem Solving (TTP), using Lesson Study (LS) as the professional development model. The findings suggest that the opportunity to experience TTP first-hand within their schools supported teachers in appreciating the affordances of various TTP practices. In particular, teachers reported changes in their beliefs regarding problem solving practice alongside developing problem posing knowledge. Of particular note was teachers’ contention that engaging with TTP practices through LS facilitated them to appreciate their students’ problem solving potential to the fullest extent. However, the planning implications of the TTP approach presented as a persistent barrier.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The purpose of this study was firstly to investigate the mathematical metacognitive characteristics of high-efficiency students by comparing high-efficiency and low-efficiency students. Secondly, the aim was to explore the pathways of mathematical metacognition of efficient mathematics learners in mathematics achievement. In this study, second-year Chinese middle school students were divided into a high-efficiency group (n = 297) and a low-efficiency group (n = 203) according to their learning efficiency in mathematics. The results indicated that the mathematical metacognitive knowledge and mathematical metacognitive monitoring of the students with high efficiency in mathematics learning were better than those of the other group. Their mathematical metacognitive characteristics were mainly reflected in the five dimensions of regulation, inspection, knowledge about individuals, knowledge about tasks, and knowledge about strategies. Furthermore, path analysis revealed that both mathematical metacognitive monitoring and mathematical metacognitive experience directly affected the mathematics achievement of students in the highly effective group. Mathematical metacognitive knowledge had an indirect effect on mathematics achievement. The findings imply that teachers should focus on the guidance of mathematical metacognition in mathematics instruction.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States provide substantial support for higher education through appropriations to public colleges and universities that can be used to maintain relatively low tuition levels and funds for financial aid. Higher education often receives disproportionate cuts during recessionary periods, and it faces potentially unprecedented reductions in coming years amid a pandemic that has left some states with revenue shortfalls. How states approach higher education cuts has the potential to exacerbate existing inequities among racially minoritized and low-income students and historically underfunded institution types. In this study, we document trends in higher education funding over time and use latent profile analysis to identify distinct approaches states have taken to higher education funding. We then examine the trajectories of higher education funding within each approach over time, particularly during prior recessions. We conclude by discussing the implications of each approach for equity, particularly in light of states’ early responses to the current economic downturn.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of providing information to families as they choose schools. Likely applicants to prekindergarten, kindergarten, and ninth grade were assigned to one of three groups. A “growth” group received lists (via U.S. mail, email, and text message) of the highest performing schools they could request. A “distance” group received lists of schools in their home geographic zone. A “control” group did not see any schools highlighted. The growth treatment led applicants to request more high-growth schools, with the strongest effects for high school choosers and families of students with disabilities. In addition, applicants’ first-choice requests appeared less malleable than their lower ranked requests. The distance treatment had only modest effects.

  Abstract
                  <p>Researchers from many countries have pointed out the difficulty of transitioning from high school to university settings, especially within the context of mathematics courses. With its abstract content, deductive thinking structure, and unique language, university mathematics is quite different from high school mathematics for students encountering such courses at the undergraduate level for the first time; often, they may perceive themselves as though they are in a different world. The two main actors playing a role in students’ transition from high school to university mathematics are the students themselves and the faculty members who are attempting to guide them through the process. This study aims to reveal the difficulties experienced by 17 to 19-year-old first-year students in the undergraduate departments of mathematics education and mathematics from the perspectives of students and faculty members. Within the scope of the study, the mathematics courses offered in the first year of a Faculty of Education program and a Faculty of Science program in Turkey were observed for one semester. Interviews were then conducted with volunteer students, as well as faculty members who were instructing the courses. We present the cognitive, epistemological, sociocultural, didactic, and affective aspects of the difficulties experienced by first-year students, as well as the reasons underlying these difficulties.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundThe Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region has notably been in the limelight of infrastructural deficit discussions over the decades. Although the region’s infrastructural development is gradually improving, the levels and pace of development remain generally poor compared to the rest of the world.ObjectivesThis study thus aims to empirically examine the roles of governance and institutions in infrastructural developments in the Sub-Sahara African (SSA) region toward addressing the pressing needs for critical infrastructures for the region.Research DesignsThe empirical strategies utilized in the study include the Common Correlated Efficient Mean Group (CCEMG) and Dynamic CCEMG methods among others. These empirical approaches were applied to analyze data on governance and institutional quality proxies for the SSA region to achieve the study’s objectives while controlling for the effects of industrial value-added, foreign capital inflow (FDI), and overall economic growth for the understudied period (1990–2019).ResultsThe results reflect the essence of governance and institutional quality as these variables significantly boost infrastructural development in SSA. In addition, industrialization and growth also show a favorable impact on the development of infrastructure thus reflecting that the transition from agrarian to industrial economies occurs in parallel with infrastructure development in the SSA. However, FDI inflows were not found to be significantly instrumental to infrastructural development in the region.ConclusionsHence, the SSA must strive to strengthen institutions and harmonize their industrial and economic push with infrastructural developments while encouraging potential foreign investors to diversify investments to infrastructural projects beyond the usual primary sector/resource-based activities.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper provides an empirical exploration of mathematics teachers’ planned practices. Specifically, it explores the practice of foreshadowing, which was one of Wasserman’s (2015) four mathematical teaching practices. The study analyzed n = 16 lessons that were planned by pairs of highly qualified and experienced secondary mathematics teachers, as well as the dialogue that transpired, to identify the considerations the teachers made during this planning process. The paper provides empirical evidence that teachers engage in foreshadowing as they plan lessons, and it exemplifies four ways teachers engaged in this practice: foreshadowing concepts, foreshadowing techniques, foregrounding concepts, and foregrounding techniques. Implications for mathematics teacher education are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>Situations where students encounter mathematical &quot;impasses&quot; – instances where their current discourse is incommensurable with the discourse demanded to solve a task – have the potential to stir emotional responses of different types. They can engender feelings of confusion and bafflement, or even embarrassment, or alternatively open students' curiosity to the ways by which more advanced mathematics can solve a problem. In this study, we closely examine the subjectifications (affective communication) of a group of graduate students encountering such an impasse in the form of a request to account for the area and perimeter of the Sierpiński triangle. We analyze these subjectifications in relation to an a priori mathematical analysis of the impasse inherent in the task. We show two major types of subjectifications, found to be communicated by distinct members of the classroom: &quot;I'm baffled&quot;, and &quot;this is not a problem&quot;. We show how the students subjectifying &quot;this is not a problem&quot; were those who avoided engagement with the impasse by attending only to the infinite process that defines the fractal, while those students who subjectified &quot;I'm baffled&quot; were those who engaged with the process as well as its outcome. Moreover, despite the lack of substantial contribution to the exploration of the impasse by those students who subjectified &quot;this is not a problem&quot;, they were positioned as the &quot;explainers&quot;, in a position of power relative to those students who expressed bafflement. We conclude by discussing the dialectical relationship between identity and engagement with mathematical impasses.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Two independent statistical tests of item compromise are presented, one based on the test takers’ responses and the other on their response times (RTs) on the same items. The tests can be used to monitor an item in real time during online continuous testing but are also applicable as part of post hoc forensic analysis. The two test statistics are simple intuitive quantities as the sum of the responses and RTs observed for the test takers on the item. Common features of the tests are ease of interpretation and computational simplicity. Both tests are uniformly most powerful under the assumption of known ability and speed parameters for the test takers. Examples of power functions for items with realistic parameter values suggest maximum power for 20–30 test takers with item preknowledge for the response-based test and 10–20 test takers for the RT-based test.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundU.S. state legislatures fill a vital role in supporting the use of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) through statutes and regulations (mandates).ObjectiveThe study determined the terms used by selected states to describe EBIs and how those terms are defined in mandates.Research MethodsThe mandates of eight purposely selected states were accessed and coded using the Westlaw Legal Research Database.ResultsConsiderable variation was found in the terms used by states to describe EBIs. Although “evidence-based” was the most frequently utilized term (60% of mandates), an additional 29 alternative terms appeared with varying frequencies. Most terms were simply mentioned, with no further definition or elaboration. When terms were further defined or elaborated, the majority were defined using numerous and different types of external sources or references. Three approaches were found in the mandates defining EBIs: “single definition,” “hierarchies of evidence levels,” and “best available evidence”; the states differed considerably in the approaches used in their mandates.ConclusionsThe variations in EBI-related terminology across states and within states, coupled with a lack of elaboration on the meaning of important terms and the predominant use of external rather than internal guidelines, may be a source of confusion for behavioral health provider agencies that seek direction about what constitutes an EBI. Prior studies indicate that many agencies may lack staff with the technical ability to adequately evaluate what constitutes an EBI. Thus, lack of clear guidance from official state government mandates may impede the implementation of EBIs within states.
