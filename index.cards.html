  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This literature review examines the research in the last 30 years in relation to university-required diversity courses, as well as highlights areas that have been understudied. Utilizing the social justice rationale for diversity, this review analyzes 25 quantitative and qualitative research articles that address university-required diversity courses. This literature review unpacks the mixed results from quantitative studies as well as analyzes the case studies presented in qualitative research. The results highlight that addressing student bias is an important goal and framework for these courses, but that the ability to shift quantitative measures of bias is not clear. I also argue that research examining student work produced in required diversity courses and course design for strategies is largely absent from the field of study.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Education has faced unprecedented disruption during the COVID pandemic. Understanding how students have adapted as we have entered a different phase of the pandemic and some communities have returned to more typical schooling will inform a suite of policy interventions and subsequent research. We use data from an oral reading fluency (ORF) assessment—a rapid assessment taking only a few minutes that measures a fundamental reading skill—to examine COVID’s effects on children’s reading ability during the pandemic. We find that students in the first 200 days of the 2020–2021 school year tended to experience slower growth in ORF relative to prepandemic years. We also observe slower growth in districts with a high percentage of English language learners and/or students eligible for free and reduced-price lunch. These findings offer valuable insight into the effects of COVID on one of the most fundamental skills taught to children.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports on concept images of 38 secondary school mathematics prospective teachers, regarding the evenness of numbers. Written assignments, individual interviews, and lesson transcripts uncover salient, erroneous concept images of even numbers as numbers that are two times “something” (i.e., 2i is an even number), or to reject the evenness of zero. The notion of concept image serves in the analysis of the findings, and the findings serve in offering two refinement notions: mis-in concept images that mistakenly grant non-examples the status of examples (e.g., 2i is an even number), and mis-out concept images that mistakenly regard examples as non-examples (e.g., zero is not an even number). We discuss possible benefits in distinguishing between these two refinement notions in mathematics education.</p>

He discusses what PBL is and responds to common misunderstandings about how it works. He describes how PBL units are structured, the role of direct instruction in PBL, how students learn content and skills through PBL, and the importance of a culture of inquiry to a PBL classroom. And he shares inspirational ideas for how teachers and schools can take PBL even further, such as by designing problem-based PBL units.

He knew that if he were going to make his vision for equity a reality, he would need to get the community’s commitment to the effort. Joshua Starr discusses why community engagement is essential to the success of equity initiatives and describes how leaders like Botana can build a team of supporters within the school district and across the wider community.

Jori S. Beck, KaaVonia Hinton, and Brandon M. Butler conducted a study of teacher leadership that garnered almost 800 survey responses and included 31 interviews with administrators and teachers. They discovered how the lack of diversity in the teacher workforce, the myth of meritocracy, and the isolation of teachers of color present barriers to diversifying the teacher leader workforce. Potential solutions include equity audits, revisions to hiring practices, and the distribution of teachers of color within school buildings.

Carole Learned-Miller of the Leadership Academy in New York spoke with school and education organization leaders who saw their organizations through a variety of challenges, including the pandemic, racial inequities, a teacher strike, and a financial crisis. These leaders shared some of the principles that helped them through. These include building relationships, communicating clearly, listening to other views, having trusted advisers, being true to their values, and staying hopeful. Leaders describe how these principles helped them weather difficult times.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 2, Page 50-55, October 2022. <br> The need for equitable access to high-quality preschool has recently gained unprecedented attention. As states and districts strive to expand access while promoting quality, curriculum quality has emerged as a critical component of preschool programs that promote young children’s learning. Yet many educators make curricular decisions with insufficient guidance on what constitutes curricular quality. Indeed, deep divisions in the field are evident regarding how to define quality in preschool curricula. Jeanne L. Reid and Sharon Lynn Kagan explore the areas of consensus and disagreement among early education leaders. They argue that — using guidance from a study at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and drawing from international models of curriculum frameworks — the field can move toward consensus on what constitutes a high-quality curriculum and thus help to fulfill the promise of equitable access to high-quality preschool.

Many students experience academic stagnation when schools fail to provide appropriate academic services. Dani Tinkel’s article examines how the limited priorities of middle school inadvertently promote disengagement and underachievement and what schools can do to ensure that all middle school students have opportunities to be cognitively challenged, including through programs like Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) and the Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM), by providing a vision for a balanced middle school experience.

  Abstract
                  <p>Early algebraic thinking is the reasoning engaged in by 5- to 12-year-olds as they build meaning for the objects and ways of thinking to be encountered within the later study of secondary school algebra. Ever since the 1990s when interest in developing algebraic thinking in the earlier grades began to emerge, there has been a steady growth in the research devoted to exploring ways of fostering this thinking. While in its early days this research had to grapple with the question of what kinds of algebraic thinking might be feasible for the younger student, the evolution of the field over the past 30 years has led to an ever-increasing range of activity that is truly multi-dimensional. In this survey paper, I have framed the multi-dimensionality of early algebraic thinking according to three overarching types, namely, that of analytic thinking, structural thinking, and functional thinking, with generalizing being the scarlet thread that runs through all three. The first part of the paper looks back to the history of the notion of early algebra and the initial research efforts aimed at characterizing early algebraic thinking. The second part delineates the three overarching theoretical dimensions of early algebraic thinking, presents a sampling of past empirical findings, and points to some of the more recent work in the field, including the contributions to this Special Issue. The paper concludes by highlighting the new directions of this domain of research and offering suggestions for further research.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and the triad of schema development are used as the framework in this study to investigate students’ understanding of the concept of circle. In this report, results are presented from the data analysis of responses to questions in semi-structured interviews of 15 students enrolled in a college geometry course at a university. This report utilizes a framework describing the interaction of the Taxicab geometry and Euclidean geometry schemata to determine what components of these, and what relationships between them, were evoked when these participating students elaborated on their understanding of the circle concept. By adapting and transferring their knowledge of concepts back and forth between these two geometries, the participants demonstrated a variety of levels of schema interaction when responding to interview questions pertaining to circles. As a result, a model of schema interaction and pedagogical suggestions to help students better develop their circle schema are provided.</p>

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 2, Page 56-57, October 2022. <br> Long-time educator Dr. Sidney Trubowitz recalls his years as an elementary school student in the late 1930s. His teachers were rigid, students were taught to be quiet and compliant, and Trubowitz learned to follow instructions without questioning them. When one teacher went too far with her discipline, his mother, an immigrant, stood up for him — one of many acts of rebellion that Trubowitz observed with satisfaction. He draws on these memories to underscore the importance of bringing children into the learning process and treating them, in all their complexity, as complete and curious independent beings.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 2, Page 60-61, October 2022. <br> Past U.S. Supreme Court rulings have held that schools and school employees must be careful to engage in religious activities while at school that could appear to endorse a particular religion above others or coerce students to engage in religious activities. However, the June 2022 Kennedy v. Bremerton School District opinion suggests that the current Court is far more concerned about violating school employees’ free exercise rights. In this case, the Court found that not allowing a football coach to pray, often with students, on the 50-yard line immediately following public school football games violated the coach’s religious free exercise rights. Robert Kim discusses the Court’s history with cases involving religious practice in schools and the potential implications of the Kennedy decision.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 2, Page 37-43, October 2022. <br> The University of Rochester and East High School in Rochester, New York, entered into a partnership in 2015, hoping to transform the school to prevent shut down by the state. Both partners were wary because of the district’s failed attempts at reform and the history of similar partnerships elsewhere. A new state-level reform option allowed the partners to form an educational partnership organization (EPO) so that they could become equal partners with some autonomy from the district. The partners decided that to succeed, they would need to involve the community. They learned from listening sessions that the community wanted the school to remain open but also wanted everything about it to change. So, instead of taking an incremental approach, they chose to transform the school’s structures, culture, leadership model, and curriculum and instruction. Valerie L. Marsh, Shaun C. Nelms, Sarah Peyre, and Joanne Larson describe how the university and the school worked together to transform East on all these fronts.

Livingston Middle School is a Title 1 school in California’s Central Valley, with 850 students in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades. Most families in this rural community are farm laborers or food production workers. Livingston Union School District serves about 2,500 students, 80 percent of whom are Latinx. Students and their families suffered losses during the pandemic, and middle schoolers missed out on key opportunities for connection and belonging.

Nancy Deutsch argues that these years are, in fact, a time of great potential if schools can abandon their stereotypes about young adolescents and create school cultures that build on their energy and willingness to explore new things. Deutsch discusses some common stereotypes about middle school and research findings that reveal the truth about the potential of students in the middle grades.

On the contrary, the characteristics of young adolescents that make them seem awkward and difficult are the same characteristics that make middle school an exciting time for growth. The role of adults is to recognize the potential of middle school students and provide a fertile ground where they can explore, be challenged, connect, find support, and develop their identities.
