  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Policymakers’ neoliberal education reforms have altered teaching and teacher education. These neoliberal policies reframe teaching and teacher education through conceptions of standards, academic achievement, data, and accountability. By doing so, many new and experienced teachers have left the field, and this has caused many who remain to question their ability to attain policymakers’ objectives and what it means to be a teacher. Yet, little is known about the impact of these neoliberal reforms on preservice teachers. In this article, we begin to attend to this issue by examining how a sample of preservice teachers made sense of their role as teachers and the profession they are entering. We then analyze whether such sensemaking reflects policymakers’ neoliberal framing of these constructs. Based on these findings, we outline opportunities for teacher educators to work with their preservice teachers to interpret, critique, and respond to policymakers’ neoliberal reforms.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This study investigates teacher participation in a national online youth civic letter writing project through the lens of teacher civic commitments. Drawing on in-depth interviews and survey data from teachers who participated in the Letters to the Next President 2.0 project, civic commitments are articulated through civic beliefs, learning goals, instructional enactments, and geopolitical context. With a generic shared belief in “youth voice,” teachers enacted the civic letter writing project through instructional activities that included (a) choice of topic, (b) publication, (c) reading letters from other youth, (d) research, (e) peer dialogue, and (f) connections beyond the Letters project. While beliefs appeared widely shared, divergence in learning goals and enactments led to distinct learning opportunities for students. With minimal research exploring the role of teachers in student civics learning, this study provides new insights to guide teacher preparation and ongoing teacher development in the realm of civics education.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The purpose of this study was to, first, examine the potential of lesson plans (LPs) of preservice science teachers (PSTs, N = 631) as a source for gathering rich data on their pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and, second, qualitatively describe PSTs’ reasons for the level of data richness in their LPs on PCK. PSTs’ handwritten LPs were analyzed through an analytic rubric, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 79 randomly selected PSTs. Results revealed a range of the level of data richness of the PSTs’ LPs on PCK and five descriptive categories about the PSTs’ reasons for the richness of LP data on PCK. The study implies that researchers should consider the inclusion of the LP as a valid tool in their triangulation design; however, they should weigh the factors that influence the collection of rich data in their PCK studies to triangulate findings better to portray a holistic picture of PCK.

  Abstract
                  <p>Integrated STEM activities are espoused as appropriate for enhancing student learning in relation to statistical concepts; however, a greater understanding of the way in which students’ ideas about those concepts develop is needed to maximise the learning potential offered by engagement in STEM activities. For this study, plant growth was chosen as a topic from the Year 6 Australian Science Curriculum as an appropriate context to employ aspects of the four STEM disciplines to explore students’ developing ideas about variation. Sixty-four Year 6 students across three school terms worked in groups of four to trial various treatments and their effects on the growth of radish or wheat seeds. This report considers two aspects of student learning related to this topic based on (i) the formative assessment of features of students’ workbook entries specifically related to variation during the part of the classroom activity based on their TinkerPlots graphs and (ii) the later summative evidence of learning in responses to end-of-year questions on the activity for 56 of the students. The workbook entries are presented via a qualitative analysis to provide evidence of the forming of understanding of variation in a STEM context, with the SOLO Taxonomy being employed to assess the longer-term evidence and developmental nature of that learning. Overall, a broader picture has emerged of the potential for developing appreciation of variation in a STEM context in primary school.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study examines technology-enhanced teacher responses and students’ written mathematical explanations to understand how to support effective teacher responding and the centering of students’ mathematical ideas. Although prior research has focused on teacher noticing and responding to students’ mathematical ideas, few studies have explored the revisions that students make to their written explanations after teacher responding and very few explore this in authentic classroom contexts. Four high school geometry teachers and thirty of their students participated in project-based tasks examining the relationships between scale factor and the dimensions, surface area, and volume of a rectangular prism. The teachers’ written feedback and the students’ written explanations were coded and scored. Results show that student explanations improved significantly after students received feedback about their mathematical ideas. Furthermore, results indicate that the teacher feedback may be more effective if it focuses on mathematical relationships between variables and that additional feedback about the variables alone may have little impact. Results contribute to an understanding of how eliciting students’ written mathematical explanations might support effective teacher responding in classroom contexts.</p>

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 319-343, June 2022. <br>The revealed preference approach in economics is central to the empirical analysis of consumer behavior. In this article, we introduce the commands checkax, aei, and powerps  as a bundle within the package rpaxioms. The first command allows a user to test whether consumer expenditure data satisfy several revealed preference axioms; the second command calculates measures of goodness of fit when the data violate these axioms; and the third command calculates power against uniformly random behavior as well as predictive success for each axiom. We illustrate the commands using individual-level experimental data and household-level aggregate consumption data.

Spatial regressions can be estimated using the spregress, spxtregress, and spivregress  commands. These commands allow users to fit spatial autoregressive models in cross-sectional and panel data. However, they are designed to estimate regressions with continuous dependent variables. Although binary spatial regressions are important in applied econometrics, they cannot be estimated in Stata. Therefore, I introduce spatbinary, a Stata command that allows users to fit spatial logit and probit models.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Multisite field experiments using the (generalized) randomized block design that assign treatments to individuals within sites are common in education and the social sciences. Under this design, there are two possible estimands of interest and they differ based on whether sites or blocks have fixed or random effects. When the average treatment effect is assumed to be identical across sites, it is common to omit site by treatment interactions and “pool” them into the error term in classical experimental design. However, prior work has not addressed the consequences of pooling when site by treatment interactions are not zero. This study assesses the impact of pooling on inference in the presence of nonzero site by treatment interactions. We derive the small sample distributions of the test statistics for treatment effects under pooling and illustrate the impacts on rejection rates when interactions are not zero. We use the results to offer recommendations to researchers conducting studies based on the multisite design.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This research study shows one teacher preparation program’s (TPP) attempt to better gauge coteaching implementation and how a TPP can provide more immediate pair support. We present findings from the analysis of 777 weekly coteaching reflection surveys completed by 44 secondary preservice teachers over 20 weeks of the clinical experience. The research team developed “ideal” benchmarks for the coteaching reflection prompts and analyzed the data in respect to these benchmarks to see how close preservice teachers met coplanning, coinstructing, and coassessing benchmarks. Data are reported according to these benchmarks, presenting these data for the entire cohort and by individual disciplines before providing detailed case studies for two pairs within the English cohort. Recommendations are provided for TPPs who want to use a similar coteaching reflection survey and approach to data analysis to inform more immediate pair support.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Teacher Education for Sustainable Development (TESD) is a niche innovation in teacher education that empowers teachers to prepare learners to address global socio-environmental challenges. To advance the diffusion of this niche innovation into general teacher education, this article offers a systematic literature review based on a qualitative analysis of 158 peer-reviewed publications on TESD research. Our results show that TESD research is a growing field characterized by five types of inquiry: designing learning environments, understanding learner attributes, measuring learning outcomes, promoting systems change, and advancing visions for the field. Major innovation potentials of TESD for more general teacher education are its emphasis on the grand socio-environmental challenges of our times, methodologies to engage with knowledge diversity (e.g., inter/transdisciplinarity), and sustainability science learning approaches (e.g., backcasting). We suggest that future work builds from this review to strengthen links between teacher education and TESD in enhancing quality education.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>In Rhode Island, out-of-school suspensions were excessively and disproportionately used to penalize low-level infractions. To address this problem, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation, effective May 2012, prohibiting out-of-school suspensions for attendance-specific infractions. Four years later, the Assembly passed additional legislation to curb out-of-school suspensions for disruption-specific infractions. This study examines the impact of these suspension reforms on out-of-school suspension outcomes for treatment infractions and corresponding racial-ethnic disparities. To execute the analyses, the study uses student-level administrative data (AY 2009–2010 to AY 2017–2018) from the Rhode Island Department of Education, along with quasi-experimental estimation. The study finds that only the first reform lowers out-of-school suspension outcomes for attendance-specific infractions and corresponding racial-ethnic disparities.

  Abstract
                  <p>Public media both reflects and shapes societal perceptions and attitudes. Teachers and others around students in mathematics classrooms have expectations for the students, projected with what appears in these media. We are most concerned about the expectations placed on students who are identified with minoritized groups—particularly students who are Indigenous or migrated to Norway. We investigate how minoritized group contexts and mathematics education appear together in Norwegian news media texts. Our analysis uses the notion of storylines to describe the expectations about minoritized groups that news media project. We found seven entangled storylines: “the majority language and culture are keys to learning and knowing mathematics,” “mathematics is language- and culture-neutral,” “minoritized groups’ mathematics achievements are linked to culture and gender,” “extraordinary measures are needed to teach students from minoritized groups mathematics,” “students from minoritized groups underachieve,” “students from minoritized groups put in extraordinary effort and time to learn mathematics,” and “minoritized mathematics students are motivated by gratitude.”</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study presents the views of stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa SSA on the present status of practical physics teaching in the secondary schools of the region and the obstacles to improvement. Their views have been analysed to establish critical factors that govern practice and have guided the formulation of a system description of the influences on the learning of practical physics. This study puts systemic understanding in the foreground and argues that such insights are critical to future reforms. Data were collected from four countries in SSA. Qualitative data were gathered from student focus groups and semi-structured interviews with school staff, ministry officials and educationalists. Illustrative quotes are reported extensively in the paper. The comments were transcribed and coded to identify common themes and factors. Quantitative surveys were carried out with students and physics teachers. The range of data acquisition is crucial in offering conclusions and suggestions that are of broader SSA relevance. The study confirms the expected wide gap between practices in the countries studied and economically developed countries. This gap is attributable to lack of material resource, limited teacher skills and staff development, ambivalent attitudes to practical work, prioritisation of ‘theory’, lack of interest in inquiry, neglect of relevant assessment and absence of relevant employment. An influence diagram was generated showing the strong connections between these and wider social and cultural factors. The study shows that effective reform requires a broad and politically attractive change.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 269-292, June 2022. <br>Commonly used unit-root tests in time-series analysis—such as the Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron tests—use a null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root. Such tests have low power against the alternative—when a time series is near integrated or highly autoregressive—implying that they do poorly in distinguishing such a series from having a unit root. Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, Journal of Econometrics 54: 159–178) introduced the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test, in which the null hypothesis is that the series is stationary, to deal with this problem. One shortcoming of the presently available Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test in Stata is that it uses asymptotic critical values regardless of the sample size. This poses a problem in that researchers—especially social scientists—are often presented with short time series. I introduce kpsstest, a command that extends the previous implementation by including an option for a zero-mean-stationary null hypothesis, generating sample and test-specific critical values, and reporting appropriate p-values.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 416-429, June 2022. <br>In statistical work, it is essential to have an overview of the data used. In, for example, biomedical articles, a standardized way of reporting summaries of continuous and categorical variables is “table 1”. This standardized way of reporting can be useful in most cases of statistical work. The basetable command is a flexible and straightforward way to build and format such table reports. The final reports are easy to style into Stata Markup and Control Language, commaseparated values, HyperText Markup Language, LATEX or TEX, or Markdown and, for example, save into a file specified by the using modifier. Also, it is possible to export the reports created by basetable into Excel worksheets. Because of the General Data Protection Regulation, it has become necessary to blur information on individuals when making reports; in basetable, there are options to blur both categorical and continuous data.
