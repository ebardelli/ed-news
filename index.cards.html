  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article develops new closed-form variance expressions for power analyses for commonly used difference-in-differences (DID) and comparative interrupted time series (CITS) panel data estimators. The main contribution is to incorporate variation in treatment timing into the analysis. The power formulas also account for other key design features that arise in practice: autocorrelated errors, unequal measurement intervals, and clustering due to the unit of treatment assignment. We consider power formulas for both cross-sectional and longitudinal models and allow for covariates. An illustrative power analysis provides guidance on appropriate sample sizes. The key finding is that accounting for treatment timing increases required sample sizes. Further, DID estimators have considerably more power than standard CITS and ITS estimators. An available Shiny R dashboard performs the sample size calculations for the considered estimators.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Knowledge about the smallest meaningful units of language, morphemes, is crucial for vocabulary and reading comprehension. This meta-analysis of 43 studies examined differences in morphological knowledge in the societal language between language-minority and language-majority children. There was a moderate to large mean group difference in morphological knowledge in favor of the language-majority children. Studies that examined inflectional knowledge (walk–walked, rose–roses) reported larger differences than studies that examined knowledge of derivations (coexist, serious) and compounds (bluebird, highlight). Studies that used oral tests and tests of expressive language reported larger differences than studies that used written tests and tests of receptive language. These findings show that morphology is an area of weakness in language-minority children. Paired with the evidence that morphological instruction improves general language ability and reading comprehension, the results suggest that morphology could be an essential component in language interventions for language-minority children.

  Abstract
                  <p>The purpose of the current study was to explore pre-service middle school mathematics teachers’ personal concept definitions of a trapezoid, parallelogram, rectangle, rhombus, square, and kite. The data were collected by a self-report instrument through which the pre-service teachers provided their answers in written form. The participants’ definitions were coded by using Zazkis and Leikin’s (Educational Studies in Mathematics, 69(2), 131–148, 2008) framework, which includes the following four main categories for determining mathematical correctness: necessary and sufficient, necessary but not sufficient, sufficient but not necessary, and neither necessary nor sufficient. The findings revealed that about half of the all definitions were correct. More specifically, the participants generated considerably higher proportion of correct definitions for a parallelogram and rhombus, while they displayed a very low performance in defining a kite. The possible reasons of the participants’ varied performance levels in defining the six basic quadrilaterals are discussed based on the linguistic (syntactic, semantic, and lexical) structure of the Turkish names given to the these quadrilaterals. The current study may provide some feedback to teacher education programs regarding the extent of knowledge that should be possessed by the pre-service teachers about definitions of special quadrilaterals before they leave their programs. Such feedback may also help mathematics teacher educators ponder on more fruitful approaches that may promote the development of pre-service teachers’ knowledge and understanding of definitions of special quadrilaterals.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Contributing to a growing body of research on acknowledging U.S. imperialism within teacher education, this article explores how knowledge production on Iran—and U.S.-Iran relations more broadly—in secondary education represents a site of what Britzman has called difficult knowledge. Here, the difficulty of classroom engagements with the theme of U.S. imperialism is highlighted in several epistemic stumbling blocks, notably notions of White epistemic authority, neoliberal multiculturalism, and imperial feeling. Drawing upon data collected during a 9-month ethnographic study, the analysis presents classroom scenes from a high school world literature unit on Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, selected by the teacher to explore themes of colonialism, imperialism, and revolution. Despite these intentions, classroom engagements with the text often reproduced Orientalist understandings. These findings inform the concluding argument that mobilizes contrapuntal reading as a generative technique for teacher education research and practice to identify and confront the epistemic bases that normalize systems of oppression.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Many states and school districts are implementing reforms to reduce reliance on exclusionary discipline such as out-of-school suspension and expulsion. This article uses survey and administrative data to study the implementation of a state-level policy limiting elementary school out-of-school suspension and expulsions. While the results are limited in sample size and generalizability, we find that survey respondents from relatively disadvantaged schools reported greater difficulties and challenges with implementation and tended to comply at lower rates. Policy makers seeking more equitable implementation of these types of reforms should work with schools to better understand and attend to local preferences, buy-in, and capacity for implementation.

In their study of central office leaders, Kate Kennedy and Jeff Walls found that caring leadership is complex, that school district leaders practice care in collaboration with others, that partnerships with community organizations enable a constellation of care, and that diversity and equity initiatives are considered complementary but separate initiatives. They recommend that leaders work with stakeholders across their districts to define caring, plan for the provision of social-emotional well-being supports, promote collaborative structures, cultivate internal and external resources, draw on data to drive caring initiatives, and weave an equity orientation into caring leadership structures.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The current literature on test equating generally defines it as the process necessary to obtain score comparability between different test forms. The definition is in contrast with Lord’s foundational paper which viewed equating as the process required to obtain comparability of measurement scale between forms. The distinction between the notions of scale and score is not trivial. The difference is explained by connecting these notions with standard statistical concepts as probability experiment, sample space, and random variable. The probability experiment underlying equating test forms with random scores immediately gives us the equating transformation as a function mapping the scale of one form into the other and thus supports the point of view taken by Lord. However, both Lord’s view and the current literature appear to rely on the idea of an experiment with random examinees which implies a different notion of test scores. It is shown how an explicit choice between the two experiments is not just important for our theoretical understanding of key notions in test equating but also has important practical consequences.

  Abstract
                  <p>Within educational research, dyslexia and other disabilities are typically conceptualized as deficits. The theory of neurodiversity encourages researchers to conceptualize cognitive differences as natural forms of human diversity with unique sets of challenges and strengths. Using neurodiversity as our theoretical framework, we analyze the experiences of five research mathematicians with dyslexia as told through personal narratives to find common strengths and challenges for dyslexic thinkers at the highest level of mathematics. We report on 4 themes: (1) highly visual and intuitive ways of mathematical thinking, (2) issues with language and translation between forms, (3) issues with memorization of mathematical facts and procedures, and (4) resilience as a strength of dyslexia that matters in mathematics. We use our participants’ insights to explore how neurodiversity, a theory of cognitive disability developed by and for neurodiverse people, could expand opportunities for research. We call for mathematics educators to consider the strengths and challenges of dyslexic learners, as well as valuing expertise from insider perspectives.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Since 1975, researchers have conducted interventions to improve the word-problem performance of elementary school students facing mathematics difficulties. The current study reports a meta-analysis of 52 studies that examined the effect of these interventions. We estimated multivariate, random-effects models (REM) with robust variance estimation (RVE) with and without outliers. Results showed a large, positive, and significant mean weighted effect size (g = 1.01 for the model with outliers; g = 0.81 for the model without outliers). Findings of meta-regression analyses showed several moderators, such as sample composition, group size, intervention dosage, group assignment approach, interventionist, year of publication, and dependent measure type, significantly explained heterogeneity in effects across studies. A sensitivity analysis showed these results were generally robust to outliers. We offer possible explanations for the findings and discuss study limitations. Finally, we propose recommendations for future research and classroom practice.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reviews 45 assessment tools designed to capture aspects of teaching and learning to teach for equity, social justice, and/or diversity to understand whether the existing tools measure up to the most pressing concerns in teacher education. First, we provide an overview of the 45 assessment tools, focusing on conventional properties. Second, we argue that the tools need to be examined beyond the conventional categories by attending to culture in both the content of assessments and their development processes. Finally, we use Kirkhart’s multicultural validity framework to reexamine the tools, focusing on their theoretical, methodological, relational, experiential, and consequential dimensions. Our analysis reveals that only a few assessments “measure up,” when examined in terms of multicultural validity. This means they tend not to do enough to address the most pressing challenges in today’s teacher education context or to advance equity and social justice goals at a deep level.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Research shows that Early College high schools have a significant impact on high school and college outcomes for students from low income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, but how similar opportunities extend to English learners (ELs) remains unknown. We examine a program that offers Early College opportunities in high schools serving large EL populations in California. Leveraging an exogenous policy change and rich administrative records, we look at the outcomes of pre- and postprogram cohorts of ELs (N = 15,090) in treated and untreated high schools. We find large, significant estimated effects on college credits earned in 12th grade but no effect on immediate college attendance after high school. The probability of attending a 4-year college decreased.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The continuous improvement (CI) approach to systems change has rapidly spread across education policy circles in recent years and has been hailed as a promising means to achieve educational equity and social justice. CI’s highly routinized, scientific process for improving efficiency and productivity is a somewhat unexpected means to pursue equity. To understand this puzzle, I examine the use of CI to promote equity through two qualitative, multilevel case studies. I draw on institutional theory to understand how CI has integrated logics of racial equity and performance, and how local actors have improvised novel approaches. This analysis illuminates the complex institutional dynamics at play with CI implementation and identifies the challenges and promise of using CI to promote educational equity.

Kristin De Vivo summarizes key findings of four studies that covered multiple grade levels and subjects. The studies found that PBL is effective across racial and socioeconomic groups and reading levels. When teachers receive a well-designed curriculum, with professional development, they can quickly implement PBL. Key PBL practices include giving students opportunities to ask and answer authentic questions, aligning projects to standards, and collaborating to foster interdisciplinary learning.

This debate is highly significant in itself, but the dispute is also noteworthy for revealing how quickly a contentious issue can become a lightning rod for considerations of what students should learn. This article addresses CRT and the role it can play in helping to explore past and current racial politics; the value of placing the current controversy within the context of a long history of curriculum conflict; and the need for critical reflection, active collaboration, and courage among educators.

In a study of 55,000 secondary school students across the United States, Challenge Success found further evidence of the bilateral relationship between students’ experiences of academic engagement and their sense of belonging, specifically when tied to school practices aimed at creating an authentic culture of inclusion and respect, an environment that fosters student agency, and assessment practices that are perceived as fair and equitable. Denise Pope and Sarah Miles share research-based strategies for educators seeking to create a climate of care that promotes both engagement and belonging.

They then share the findings of a qualitative study in which they interviewed nine educators who are leading a re-envisioning of teacher well-being in their schools and districts. They conclude with ideas for how schools can shift their organizational cultures to better support teachers’ emotional well-being.
