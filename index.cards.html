  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Knowledge about the smallest meaningful units of language, morphemes, is crucial for vocabulary and reading comprehension. This meta-analysis of 43 studies examined differences in morphological knowledge in the societal language between language-minority and language-majority children. There was a moderate to large mean group difference in morphological knowledge in favor of the language-majority children. Studies that examined inflectional knowledge (walk–walked, rose–roses) reported larger differences than studies that examined knowledge of derivations (coexist, serious) and compounds (bluebird, highlight). Studies that used oral tests and tests of expressive language reported larger differences than studies that used written tests and tests of receptive language. These findings show that morphology is an area of weakness in language-minority children. Paired with the evidence that morphological instruction improves general language ability and reading comprehension, the results suggest that morphology could be an essential component in language interventions for language-minority children.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This article reviews 45 assessment tools designed to capture aspects of teaching and learning to teach for equity, social justice, and/or diversity to understand whether the existing tools measure up to the most pressing concerns in teacher education. First, we provide an overview of the 45 assessment tools, focusing on conventional properties. Second, we argue that the tools need to be examined beyond the conventional categories by attending to culture in both the content of assessments and their development processes. Finally, we use Kirkhart’s multicultural validity framework to reexamine the tools, focusing on their theoretical, methodological, relational, experiential, and consequential dimensions. Our analysis reveals that only a few assessments “measure up,” when examined in terms of multicultural validity. This means they tend not to do enough to address the most pressing challenges in today’s teacher education context or to advance equity and social justice goals at a deep level.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Research shows that Early College high schools have a significant impact on high school and college outcomes for students from low income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, but how similar opportunities extend to English learners (ELs) remains unknown. We examine a program that offers Early College opportunities in high schools serving large EL populations in California. Leveraging an exogenous policy change and rich administrative records, we look at the outcomes of pre- and postprogram cohorts of ELs (N = 15,090) in treated and untreated high schools. We find large, significant estimated effects on college credits earned in 12th grade but no effect on immediate college attendance after high school. The probability of attending a 4-year college decreased.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The continuous improvement (CI) approach to systems change has rapidly spread across education policy circles in recent years and has been hailed as a promising means to achieve educational equity and social justice. CI’s highly routinized, scientific process for improving efficiency and productivity is a somewhat unexpected means to pursue equity. To understand this puzzle, I examine the use of CI to promote equity through two qualitative, multilevel case studies. I draw on institutional theory to understand how CI has integrated logics of racial equity and performance, and how local actors have improvised novel approaches. This analysis illuminates the complex institutional dynamics at play with CI implementation and identifies the challenges and promise of using CI to promote educational equity.

Kristin De Vivo summarizes key findings of four studies that covered multiple grade levels and subjects. The studies found that PBL is effective across racial and socioeconomic groups and reading levels. When teachers receive a well-designed curriculum, with professional development, they can quickly implement PBL. Key PBL practices include giving students opportunities to ask and answer authentic questions, aligning projects to standards, and collaborating to foster interdisciplinary learning.

This debate is highly significant in itself, but the dispute is also noteworthy for revealing how quickly a contentious issue can become a lightning rod for considerations of what students should learn. This article addresses CRT and the role it can play in helping to explore past and current racial politics; the value of placing the current controversy within the context of a long history of curriculum conflict; and the need for critical reflection, active collaboration, and courage among educators.

In a study of 55,000 secondary school students across the United States, Challenge Success found further evidence of the bilateral relationship between students’ experiences of academic engagement and their sense of belonging, specifically when tied to school practices aimed at creating an authentic culture of inclusion and respect, an environment that fosters student agency, and assessment practices that are perceived as fair and equitable. Denise Pope and Sarah Miles share research-based strategies for educators seeking to create a climate of care that promotes both engagement and belonging.

Kristabel Stark, Neesha Daulat, and Simon King explain why teachers’ emotional well-being matters for the health of school organizations and why the nature of teachers’ emotional well-being is often misunderstood. They then share the findings of a qualitative study in which they interviewed nine educators who are leading a re-envisioning of teacher well-being in their schools and districts. They conclude with ideas for how schools can shift their organizational cultures to better support teachers’ emotional well-being.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Since 1975, researchers have conducted interventions to improve the word-problem performance of elementary school students facing mathematics difficulties. The current study reports a meta-analysis of 52 studies that examined the effect of these interventions. We estimated multivariate, random-effects models (REM) with robust variance estimation (RVE) with and without outliers. Results showed a large, positive, and significant mean weighted effect size (g = 1.01 for the model with outliers; g = 0.81 for the model without outliers). Findings of meta-regression analyses showed several moderators, such as sample composition, group size, intervention dosage, group assignment approach, interventionist, year of publication, and dependent measure type, significantly explained heterogeneity in effects across studies. A sensitivity analysis showed these results were generally robust to outliers. We offer possible explanations for the findings and discuss study limitations. Finally, we propose recommendations for future research and classroom practice.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Contributing to a growing body of research on acknowledging U.S. imperialism within teacher education, this article explores how knowledge production on Iran—and U.S.-Iran relations more broadly—in secondary education represents a site of what Britzman has called difficult knowledge. Here, the difficulty of classroom engagements with the theme of U.S. imperialism is highlighted in several epistemic stumbling blocks, notably notions of White epistemic authority, neoliberal multiculturalism, and imperial feeling. Drawing upon data collected during a 9-month ethnographic study, the analysis presents classroom scenes from a high school world literature unit on Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, selected by the teacher to explore themes of colonialism, imperialism, and revolution. Despite these intentions, classroom engagements with the text often reproduced Orientalist understandings. These findings inform the concluding argument that mobilizes contrapuntal reading as a generative technique for teacher education research and practice to identify and confront the epistemic bases that normalize systems of oppression.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Many states and school districts are implementing reforms to reduce reliance on exclusionary discipline such as out-of-school suspension and expulsion. This article uses survey and administrative data to study the implementation of a state-level policy limiting elementary school out-of-school suspension and expulsions. While the results are limited in sample size and generalizability, we find that survey respondents from relatively disadvantaged schools reported greater difficulties and challenges with implementation and tended to comply at lower rates. Policy makers seeking more equitable implementation of these types of reforms should work with schools to better understand and attend to local preferences, buy-in, and capacity for implementation.

The authors in the February 2022 Kappan consider how to approach these relationships with care.

Fortunately, there are innovations from research and development efforts that can help districts put into practice the best ideas about instructional coaching. Andrew Wayne and Jane Coggshall describe how detailed manuals, online platforms, and clear monitoring routines can help district leaders ensure that the chosen coaching program is being implemented with fidelity.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 5, Page 13-17, February 2022. <br> Care and social-emotional supports are of concern for school district leaders who want to create a caring culture throughout their district. In their study of central office leaders, Kate Kennedy and Jeff Walls found that caring leadership is complex, that school district leaders practice care in collaboration with others, that partnerships with community organizations enable a constellation of care, and that diversity and equity initiatives are considered complementary but separate initiatives. They recommend that leaders work with stakeholders across their districts to define caring, plan for the provision of social-emotional well-being supports, promote collaborative structures, cultivate internal and external resources, draw on data to drive caring initiatives, and weave an equity orientation into caring leadership structures.

Research suggests that when teachers work to build nurturing learning environments, there are substantial benefits for students, especially those from historically marginalized groups. Tiffini Pruitt-Britton, Anne Garrison Wilhelm, and Jonee Wilson share examples from their research that show how using humor, sharing personal stories, and disclosing rationales and mistakes humanize teachers and cultivate an inviting environment that supports student learning.
