  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In this article, we examine the promise of a popular set of sentence stems, “I notice” and “I wonder,” for fostering productive discussion in an online course for teachers. Drawing on teachers’ responses to one another’s classroom reflections, we look for evidence regarding how course prompts encouraging teachers to use these stems influence the types of contributions teachers offer. We analyze teachers’ responses at the module, response, and sentence level, situating our inquiry in the context of common challenges related to discourse in teacher professional learning contexts. Our findings suggest that prompting teachers to report what they “notice” and what they “wonder” may support the development of teachers’ professional vision and exposure to diverse perspectives.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Understanding students’ perspectives on inclusive behavior is important for addressing the bullying, victimization, and exclusion that many middle school and high school students, particularly marginalized students, continue to face at school. This study explored how students give meaning to inclusive behavior at school and the conditions that support inclusive behavior. Using data from 30 focus groups conducted with students, the findings expand on three primary themes: students’ broad descriptions of inclusive behavior, their understanding of the qualities and characteristics of an inclusive person, and their beliefs about what makes a school inclusive. Findings from this study can inform organizational practices to facilitate inclusive behavior in schools in a manner consistent with how students themselves view inclusivity.

  Abstract

      mentative problem solving in mathematics classrooms is a crucial practice that supports important student learning goals via collaborative deliberation and consensus building, but also places substantial cognitive and affective demands on both students and teacher. In this in-depth qualitative study, we considered how students’ emotions during argumentative discourse relate to their learning of real-life functional situations, an area of mathematics highlighted in the literature as foundational yet difficult. Observations, written reflections, and interviews of six Year 9 (14–15-year-old) students’ experience of argument construction, critique, and consensus building were analyzed for insights into emotions experienced during small-group argumentative problem solving, and how various emotions might support or hinder students’ mathematics learning. The emotion of frustration was experienced frequently and was found to facilitate persistence and the correction of misconceptions, but also to hinder the learning in contributing to ongoing tension and eventual resignation. Peer critique was found to stimulate negative emotions but positive learning processes, such as seeking other ways to explain one’s reasoning, and re-evaluating one’s own incorrect solutions.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>What are the effects of teaching the dominant mathematics on the wholeness and integrity of the cultural, social and linguistic resources of diverse communities? In this text, I seek to capture the risks associated with utilising non-Western resources in the teaching of the dominant mathematics in order to elucidate possible types of harms that conventional mathematics education could cause to various non-Western communities. In particular, I challenge various dominant theoretical views that endorse the employment of the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of others to teach and learn mathematics, without paying similar or even deeper ethical attention to the mutual and reciprocal effects of the taught and learnt mathematics. I propose an epistemology of interrelationships; I call attention to possible harms caused by utilising the social, cultural and linguistic (re)sources of some non-Western communities as part of the teaching and learning of dominant school mathematics on the same (re)sources of those communities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>We used an assessment platform to study the potential of rich student data obtained online to influence classroom instruction and help teachers respond to students’ needs. The article focuses on technology-based formative assessment in the course of teaching a unit on quadrilaterals. We studied example-eliciting tasks, requiring students to determine the truth of a given claim and to use interactive diagrams to construct examples to support their answer. Our aim was to teach the concept of parallelogram by exploring students’ concept images and responding adequately to their submissions. A group of 11-year-old students studied the unit as part of their geometry curriculum. We used an assessment platform, which provides tools designed to monitor examples produced by students interacting with a dynamic geometry environment and to characterize critical and non-critical attributes of the submitted constructions. We present the teaching decisions made by the teacher (the first author), who used automatic feedback on the characteristics of three assessment tasks.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In the spring of 2020, schools and universities around the world were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The relative lockdown affected more than 1.5 billion learners as teachers and students sheltered at home for several weeks. As schooling moved online, teachers were forced to change how they taught. In the research presented here, we focus on university mathematics professors, and we analyze how their practice, knowledge, and beliefs intertwine and change under these circumstances. More specifically, the context of the pandemic and the relative lockdown provides us with the experimental basis to argue that the new practice affected both knowledge and beliefs of mathematics teachers and that practice, knowledge, and beliefs form a system. Being part of a system, the reactions to change in practice can be of two types, namely, the system as a whole tries to resist change, or the system as a whole changes — and it changes significantly. The research presented here proposes a model for describing and analyzing what we called a teaching system and examines three cases that help to better depict the systemic nature of teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study investigated how 46 pre-service teachers (PSTs) planned for differentiation of instruction in mathematics. Content analysis was utilized to explore the differentiation strategies included and student characteristics considered in PST plans and how PSTs used differentiation strategies and student characteristics to differentiate lesson content, process, product, and environment. In addition, a rubric was designed and utilized to analyze the level of detail PSTs provided in their plans. Results indicated that overall, PSTs were developing in their planning for differentiation of instruction, using general terms to describe the modifications they would make to meet student needs. Moreover, results revealed that PSTs included strategies to differentiate lesson content and environment most often in their plans and frequently considered student readiness levels when planning for differentiation. Findings also revealed that PSTs need support in learning how to plan for differentiation based on student cultural backgrounds. Implications for mathematics teacher preparation are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Recursive reasoning is a powerful tool used extensively in problem solving. For us, recursive reasoning includes iteration, sequences, difference equations, discrete dynamical systems, pattern identification, and mathematical induction; all of these can represent how things change, but in discrete jumps. Given the school mathematics curriculum’s later emphasis on calculus—the mathematics of change in continuous contexts—it is surprising that the curriculum seems to neglect recursive thinking after the early grades. Research shows that recursion supports the learning of algebra among younger students, but the lack of similar research with older students is concerning. In this paper we suggest possible affordances from teaching recursive modeling, including a basic model of the spread of contagious diseases. We also discuss different ways to present these models at various points in the curriculum that might develop connections between mathematics and the real world, and support students’ learning of mathematics. This leads to what we, as mathematicians, think would be interesting research questions for mathematical educators.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>It is a challenge for mathematics teachers to provide activities for their students at a high level of cognitive demand. In this article, we explore the possibilities that history of mathematics has to offer to meet this challenge. History of mathematics can be applied in mathematics education in different ways. We offer a framework for describing the appearances of history of mathematics in curriculum materials. This framework consists of four formats that are entitled speck, stamp, snippet, and story. Characteristic properties are named for each format, in terms of size, content, location, and function. The formats are related to four ascending levels of cognitive demand. We describe how these formats, together with design principles that are also derived from the history of mathematics, can be used to raise the cognitive level of existing tasks and design new tasks. The combination of formats, cognitive demand levels, and design principles is called the 4S-model. Finally, we advocate that this 4S-model can play a role in mathematics teacher training to enable prospective teachers to reach higher cognitive levels in their mathematics classrooms.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study is part of the international survey studies on teachers’ beliefs concerning the integration of children’s literature in mathematics teaching and learning, and this paper reports the findings of the thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses elicited from 287 primary school teachers and teacher trainees in Taiwan. Using the seminal social psychology theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 179–211, 1991) to frame the findings, this study highlights 11 perceived barriers and 11 perceived enablers that are thought to influence the teachers’ intention to integrate children’s literature in their mathematics teaching. More specifically, we identified time constraint, lack of pedagogical knowledge and confidence, and resource constraint as being the most-cited perceived barriers, while pedagogical benefits, desire to improve teaching, and enabling social norms were identified as the top perceived enablers. Ultimately, this article offers several recommendations to address some of these key perceived barriers.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no time constraints.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Rational number knowledge is a crucial feature of primary school mathematics that predicts students’ later mathematics achievement. Many students struggle with the transition from natural number to rational number reasoning, so novel pedagogical approaches to support the development of rational number knowledge are valuable to mathematics educators worldwide. Digital game-based learning environments may support a wide range of mathematics skills. NanoRoboMath, a digital game-based learning environment, was developed to enhance students’ conceptual and adaptive rational number knowledge. In this paper, we tested the effectiveness of a preliminary version of the game with fifth and sixth grade primary school students (N = 195) using a quasi-experimental design. A small positive effect of playing the NanoRoboMath game on students’ rational number conceptual knowledge was observed. Students’ overall game performance was related to learning outcomes concerning their adaptive rational number knowledge and understanding of rational number representations and operations.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>From the socio-critical perspective of mathematical modeling, reflexive discussions about the nature, criteria, and consequences of mathematical models are not a natural consequence of modeling in school. This report is part of a larger study focused on stimulating reflexive discussions in practice employing constructivist grounded theory as a research method. Twenty-seven college algebra students engaged in a 3-week modeling project at a community college in the USA. Audio-recorded group discussions and written reflections were collected to determine how reflexive discussions were taking place. Analysis of students’ actions and reflexive discussions during the modeling project produced four concepts: voicing mathematics, personalizing mathematics, challenging mathematics, and negotiating mathematics. These concepts are integrated into an overall process for stimulating reflexive discussions and are conceptualized as unboxing mathematics. The overarching concept of unboxing mathematics represents one interpretation of how reflexive discussions may be constituted during modeling activities and identifies classroom mathematical practices specific to the socio-critical modeling context of this study.</p>
