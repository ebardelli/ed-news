  Evaluation Review, Volume 45, Issue 1-2, Page 70-104, February-April 2021. <br>Background: In randomized controlled trials, attrition rates often differ by treatment status, jeopardizing causal inference. Inverse probability weighting methods and estimation of treatment effect bounds have been used to adjust for this bias. Objectives: We compare the performance of various methods within two samples, both generated through lottery-based randomization: one with considerable differential attrition and an augmented dataset with less problematic attrition. Research Design: We assess the performance of various correction methods within the dataset with problematic attrition. In addition, we conduct simulation analyses. Results: Within the more problematic dataset, we find the correction methods often performed poorly. Simulation analyses indicate that deviations from the underlying assumptions for bounding approaches damage the performance of estimated bounds. Conclusions: We recommend the verification of the underlying assumptions in attrition correction methods whenever possible and, when verification is not possible, using these methods with caution.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers of color increase school success for students of color. Yet, little attention has been paid to whether school attendance behaviors also increase from same race and ethnicity matches. To address this, our study used administrative data provided by a California high school district for the school years 2014 to 2018. We explored student absenteeism at the date and class period levels. Using this rich, longitudinal data set, we employed grade, school, class period, student, and date fixed effects models to examine the association between student–teacher matches and student absenteeism. Student–teacher race and ethnicity matches were associated with fewer unexcused absences for Latinx students. The results also indicate that associations were strongest for Latinx students in 11th and 12th grades—the age group in K–12 that has the most individual agency when it comes to getting to school. Furthermore, we found no evidence of declines in excused absences, which reflect health.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Broadly understood, values represent orientation guidelines for daily action, thinking, and feeling. Thus, they affect teachers’ everyday work and are among their professional competencies. While general values and some single profession-specific values of teachers (e.g., responsibility) have already been investigated empirically, the current study aims to cover a broader range of profession-specific values by developing and validating the Tübingen Inventory to Measure Teachers’ Profession-Specific Value Orientations (TIVO), based on three independent studies with pre-service (Studies 1 and 2; N1 = 334, N2 = 239) and in-service teachers (N3 = 308). The results demonstrate that the TIVO is appropriate to assess four profession-specific values in a second-order model: caring, justice, responsibility, and truthfulness as first-order factors, with fairness as a second-order factor loading on the latter three first-order factors. The results from preregistered experiments and confirmatory factor analysis provide consistent evidence for the construct validity of the TIVO.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>‘DIY’ publications called zines have long been a way for marginalized communities to record their stories, spread information and organize. However, this article presents zines as a potential research tool for action researchers who are working within organisational contexts. The authors, both museum professionals, action researchers and zinesters, use examples from their research within art museums to examine the value of zines as a methodology. Though the research projects take place within art organisations, using the four themes of aesthetics, communities of practice, counter-narratives and plurality it considers how zines could be used more broadly as a research tool in other knowledge-based settings. The authors provide a recommendation for practitioners to explore zining to engender dialogic cultures in their organisations as well as their potential in shaping ‘major’ and ‘minor’ organisational change.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between teachers’ post-instruction noticing (PIN) and the quality of their mathematics instruction. We analyzed the conversations of elementary teachers around five coached lessons and scored their level of post-instruction noticing and the mathematical quality of the instruction of the lesson. We compared teachers’ PIN levels with their instructional quality, using scores from the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric, for each coached lesson. There was both alignment and discrepancies between the level of PIN and MQI scores. Explorations of the cognitive and psychological constructs that seemed to influence teacher’s noticing showed that mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), efficacy, beliefs, emotions, and identity was influential on teachers’ PIN although they seemed to influence teachers differently. In some cases, the constructs appeared to support attentiveness to students’ thinking and in other cases they did not. We discuss implications for professional development and future research on teachers’ noticing.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This study explores the association between sanctuary policies and the high school completion and college enrollment of Hispanic undocumented youth. Sanctuary policies, which city, county, and/or state governments implement, prohibit local political leaders and police officials from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement officers regarding the questioning, detention, and deportation of undocumented immigrants. This study uses data from the American Community Survey and applies a difference-in-differences design. On average, my preferred specification detected no association with high school completion or college enrollment. These findings suggest that although these policies may help counteract immigration enforcement, they may not reduce uncertainty enough to have a significant relationship with educational outcomes.

  Abstract
                  <p>Computer science (CS) education finds itself at a pivotal moment to reckon with what it means to accept, use, and create technologies, with the continued recruitment of minoritized students into the field. In this paper, we build on the oral traditions of educating with stories, and take the reader on two journeys. We begin with a story that leads us in thinking about where computer science education is, in the wake of slavery, under the New Jim Code. Within a BlackCrit framework, we shake the grounds of the computer science field, where technologies are often promoted as objective, but reflect and reproduce existing inequalities. In tune with maintaining current systems of power, efforts to broaden participation in computer science have been heavily driven by industry, government, and military interests. These interests ultimately push us farther away from sustainable relations with the earth and with each other, and risk the very lives of the same communities the field claims to help. However, we can rewrite the narratives of the role of technology in our lives. We present a second story in which we place abolitionist theories and practices in conversation with computer science education. In this paper we explore (1) In what ways does computing education support systems that enable Black death? and (2) How might integrating an abolitionist framework into computer science open up possibilities for world-building and dreaming in the name of Black Life? We imagine a different future where computer science is used as a tool in life-affirming, world-building projects. We invite readers to engage with this piece as a part of an active dialogue towards combating anti-Black logics in the field of computer science education. </p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Colleges have increasingly turned to predictive analytics to target at-risk students for additional support. Most of the predictive analytic applications in higher education are proprietary, with private companies offering little transparency about their underlying models. We address this lack of transparency by systematically comparing two important dimensions: (1) different approaches to sample and variable construction and how these affect model accuracy and (2) how the selection of predictive modeling approaches, ranging from methods many institutional researchers would be familiar with to more complex machine learning methods, affects model performance and the stability of predicted scores. The relative ranking of students’ predicted probability of completing college varies substantially across modeling approaches. While we observe substantial gains in performance from models trained on a sample structured to represent the typical enrollment spells of students and with a robust set of predictors, we observe similar performance between the simplest and the most complex models.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Multiple baseline (MB) designs are becoming more prevalent in educational and behavioral research, and as they do, there is growing interest in combining effect size estimates across studies. To further refine the meta-analytic methods of estimating the effect, this study developed and compared eight alternative methods of estimating intervention effects from a set of MB studies. The methods differed in the assumptions made and varied in whether they relied on within- or between-series comparisons, modeled raw data or effect sizes, and did or did not standardize. Small sample functioning was examined through two simulation studies, which showed that when data were consistent with assumptions the bias was consistently less than 5% of the effect size for each method, whereas root mean squared error varied substantially across methods. When assumptions were violated, substantial biases were found. Implications and limitations are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>If we envision a future for Black young learners where their full humanity is honoured and educators facilitate rigorous science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning experiences that are justice-focused, we must disrupt systemic racism now. In this article we discuss how anti-Blackness is pervasive in science and mathematics education, especially for young learners. We also address why teacher educators must disrupt anti-Black racism in our work with elementary teacher candidates and in our research. We argue that to do this work and disrupt anti-Blackness, elementary teacher educators and teacher candidates need political clarity (Beauboeuf-LaFontant, 1999). Political clarity is the understanding of how structural and school inequalities work to (re)produce differential learning experiences for minoritized learners. We offer suggestions for how teacher educators can further develop their teacher candidates’ political clarity. Drawing upon our prior research, course assignments, and experiences as Black women educators and teacher educators, we share examples of how an individual’s political clarity can be developed within science and mathematics methods courses. In doing so, we build upon prior research in STEM teacher education on how teachers come to see teaching as a political act and engage in the hard work of equity-focused STEM teaching.</p>
