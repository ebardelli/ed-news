  Abstract
                  <p>Formulas are involved in most parts of the mathematical curriculum in upper secondary education and in everyday mathematics classrooms, but research shows that students have difficulties using formulas adequately. When students are presented with a task, the task activates a conceptual frame in the students, making them perceive formulas in a specific way, thereby affecting their mathematical behaviour. In this paper, building ideal types of patterns of mathematical behaviours is used to conceptualise ‘view on formula’ specified by several specific views. The concept of ‘view on formula’ is applied in an analysis of a classroom episode pointing to reasons for the difficulties students have with handling formulas. When views are either missing or not used in a flexible way this can lead to an unsuccessful handling of formulas. Also, students’ views on formula may indicate what knowledge is missing for solving a task involving formulas. Taken together, this points to the importance of paying attention to views on formulas in the everyday mathematics classroom.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>While curricular change often begins with a new textbook, its eventual enactment in the hands of individual teachers depends on their orientation towards the curriculum and its representation in the textbook. Studying this teacher-textbook relationship is crucial for understanding how curricular reform intended by textbook designers is likely to be implemented in individual classrooms. We have been studying this by means of didactic tagging—a methodology where teachers assign metadata to textbook tasks. Categories of metadata include both descriptive aspects of tasks and aspects of their envisioned enactment. Prior research has focused on characteristics of the textbook that emerge as patterns in metadata that persist across multiple taggers. In the current study we turn our attention to individual differences across taggers. Four teachers tagged tasks that comprise an entire pre-calculus high school textbook. Analysis generated non-trivial findings regarding each tagger’s interaction with the textbook, in the form of individual patterns in the tagged metadata. These patterns allowed us to put forth tentative “profiles” of each of the four teachers’ interactions with the textbook. We propose this as a method for investigating and assessing teachers’ didactic orientations, and for predicting aspects of their enactment of textbook curricula, while avoiding time-consuming and intrusive observation of classroom teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, we explore theoretical approaches to Japanese teachers’ lesson designs involving the adaptation of mathematics textbooks for instructional change. In Japan, although most teachers use textbooks as the main resource for lesson planning, called kyouzai kenkyuu, the ways in which they use textbooks can differ. In a kyouzai kenkyuu practice, Japanese teachers sometimes attempt to design innovative tasks and/or learning trajectories beyond or parallel to the textbooks and curriculum guidelines. Such practice is often invisible to international researchers, since it is culturally situated in the local context. To make it more visible, in this study we address and advance theoretical approaches using two frameworks which are well-established for research in mathematics education, namely, Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD) and Documentational Approach to Didactics (DAD). Two cases of lesson design regarding fractions using the same textbook chapter for 3rd graders in primary schools in Japan, are used as examples to illustrate crucial elements of each framework and ways of combining and coordinating both frameworks. As a result, we conceptualise teachers’ kyouzai kenkyuu practice using two approaches: from a praxeological analysis based on ATD, the difference in teachers’ mathematical and didactic knowledge was emphasised, while within DAD, the difference in the instrumentalisation process was emphasised. This analysis implies that the two theoretical approaches can be compatible, and used to gain deeper insight into the relationship between lesson design using the textbook and teacher knowledge.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Problem posing, the process of formulating problems based on a given situation, is an essential practice in mathematics and other disciplines. Although this is acknowledged in policy documents, problem posing is neither substantively nor consistently included in the school mathematics curriculum. In this paper, we first comment on the state of problem posing in school mathematics and discuss three recommendations to improve its integration into curriculum materials and classroom practice. These recommendations present a low barrier to entry for teachers and students and require only minor changes to common mathematics classroom activities and curriculum materials. Based on the three recommendations, as well as the features of effective teacher professional development, a program was created to investigate longitudinally the impact of problem-posing professional development on teachers’ conceptions of problem posing and their design of lessons to teach mathematics using problem posing, as well as on students’ learning. Initial findings are presented, including the significant changes in teachers’ conceptions of problem posing and teachers’ design of lessons to teach mathematics using problem posing, as well as the impact on students’ learning.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Engaging students in processes of mathematizing and active knowledge organization (instead of telling and rehearsing ready-made mathematics) is a key demand for high quality mathematics instruction. Although many mathematically rich context problems have been designed and published in textbooks, their impact on regular mathematics classrooms remains limited, as teachers face challenges in shaping and enacting the important phase of knowledge organization. The 15-year project KOSIMA presented in this paper was aimed at supporting teachers in really enhancing these processes by means of a textbook for Grades 5–10. The paper provides an overview of different studies conducted during the project in order to show how the project developed a research base for the support of teachers. The paper also shows that different research approaches need to be combined to establish an appropriate research base: In iterative design research cycles of topic-specific didactical design research, learning environments were designed and investigated with the aim of understanding the obstacles encountered in implementing the desired processes. In this paper, we focus on an example of one particular obstacle, namely, teachers’ need of support in engaging students in processes of active knowledge organization. This obstacle was overcome by developing new types of tasks for active knowledge organization. The theoretical outcome of the design research resulted in two hypotheses for improving relevant features of the design of these tasks, which were tested in two controlled trials. Finally, a longitudinal field study of 312 students gave first indications that the classes that worked with the textbook had significantly higher learning gains than classes using other textbooks. In sum, we can show that textbooks can support changes in classroom practices when the obstacles that occur for both teachers and students are carefully investigated and treated.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study investigated the process of instructional change required to translate data on student progress along learning trajectories (LTs) into relevant instructional modifications. Researchers conducted a professional development session on ratio LTs, which included analyzing 3 years of district-level data from Math-Mapper 6–8, a digital LT-based diagnostic assessment application, with fifteen 6th and 7th grade teachers. Teachers subsequently conducted a lesson study to enact what they had learned, allowing researchers to study how teachers used data on student progress along ratio equivalence LTs to design, implement, and evaluate the lesson study. Researchers applied a framework for LT-based data-driven decision making to analyze video data of the lesson study activities. Teachers successfully scanned data reports to pinpoint the LT levels at which to target modified instruction. In one instance, they focused too narrowly on a single item resulting in excessive lesson time on tasks on graph literacy external to the LT. In the other, their data interpretation was overly general and resulted in the design and implementation of a sequence of tasks that reversed the order implied in the LT and relied on the use of more sophisticated strategies from subsequent LTs. Results suggest a need for more data interpretation skills, a deep understanding of the learning theory underpinning LTs, and more precision in teacher discourse around LTs.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper investigates the phenomenon of compartmentalisation of knowledge in the teaching and learning of continuous probability distributions and integral calculus at the secondary-tertiary transition in France. Using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD), and in particular the key notion of praxeology, we investigate in which sense those two sectors may be described as compartmentalised in current textbooks. We then study, by means of a questionnaire, the educational effects of the compartmentalisation: do students’ difficulties in completing “bridging tasks” (tasks that require to relate the two sectors) reflect the partial disconnections revealed by the praxeological analyses? The key notion of ostensive, combined with the role played by the technology in the sense of ATD, is used to interpret the data. Altogether, this study sheds light on the deficit of cognitive flexibility required to change mathematical sectors, which is understood as a result of deficient praxeologies developed within the institutions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Computational thinking and activity are vital aspects of what it means to conduct scientific and mathematical work. In light of this, some propose that students’ mathematical education should include an integration of computing into their mathematical experiences, giving students opportunities to engage with computational tools as they reason about mathematical concepts. In this commentary, we make a case that the international RUME community should focus on studying the integration of computing in research in undergraduate mathematics education. We situate this discussion within existing literature. Then, we suggest ways in which researchers can incorporate ideas related to computing, and we propose ideas for how investigations into computing might practically be incorporated into our already-existing research foci. Ultimately, we hope to motivate other members of the RUME community to join us in what we consider to be a timely and exciting endeavor.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Executive function skills are a set of cognitive processes that help individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior and have been linked to benefits in academic achievement and other learning-related outcomes. Recently, there has been interest in understanding how attending center-based preschool may relate to the development of executive function skills. This study used the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010–2011 (n ~ 9,270) to examine the association between preschool attendance and executive function skills in each grade of elementary school. The results of the analysis suggest small initial associations of preschool attendance with some subdomains of executive function (working memory) but not others (cognitive flexibility). These associations are heterogenous based on preschool type (i.e., public vs. private). The longitudinal analysis revealed rapid attenuation of initially positive associations, but also some indications of so-called “sleeper effects” emerged in late elementary school for working memory. Implications for research and policy are discussed.

  Abstract
                    <p>One of the most prevalent features of digital mathematics textbooks, compared to traditional ones, is the provision of automated feedback on students’ solutions. Since feedback is regarded as an important factor that influences learning, this is often seen as an affordance of digital mathematics textbooks. While there is a large body of mainly quantitative research on the effectiveness of feedback in general, very little is known about how feedback actually affects students’ individual content specific learning processes and conceptual development. A theoretical framework based on Rabardel’s theory of the instrument and Vergnaud’s theory of conceptual fields is developed to study qualitatively how feedback actually functions in the learning process. This framework was applied in a case study of two elementary school students’ learning processes when working on a probability task from a German 3rd grade digital textbook. The analysis allowed detailed reconstruction of how students made sense of the information provided by the feedback and adjusted their behavior accordingly. This in-depth analysis unveiled that feedback does not necessarily foster conceptual development in the desired way, and a correct solution does not always coincide with conceptual understanding. The results point to some obstacles that students face when working individually on tasks from digital mathematics textbooks with automated feedback, and indicate that feedback needs to be developed in design-based research cycles in order to yield the desired effects.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Curriculum reform brings new approaches to classroom practice. As changes to the curriculum are implemented, teachers need to receive additional support from textbooks and other materials. In the study presented in this paper, we explored the use of resources during the process of educational reform in Croatia. The focus was on the use of a mathematics textbook set as the main resource, but the use of other material and non-material resources was also examined. The study also dealt with the social factors that influenced the use of these resources. It was designed as a case study of one mathematics teacher and her students, examined at three time points, before the reform, in the preparation period, and subsequent to the implementation of the reform. The results showed that the textbook set is a stable resource over the time periods, although it did undergo some changes towards digitalization. The teacher’s professional development was shown to be an important non-material resource during the period of change. The research also revealed that the participants’ decisions concerning the use of resources depended on some social issues, such as norms concerned with being a teacher or a student. The study showed that longitudinal monitoring of the use of resources in the period of curricular change may contribute to a better understanding of the processes of instructional transformation and development.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Levering change is hard, and an incremental process. In the education process it requires an interaction between teachers, resources and learners. Levering change with human resources—teachers themselves, is a long term, time-intensive process requiring investment and commitment. The teacher–resources relationship is complex and not always optimal, particularly in disadvantaged educational environments where resources are constrained, and the education system is centralized and highly regulated. This article posits a mathematics teaching framework developed in a low-income educational context to make more transparent the relationship between teachers and resources to the benefit of learning both of teachers and of learners.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Students need to create mental models for different types of addition and subtraction situations in order to develop a broad and viable understanding of these operations. Although most students succeed when changing or combining sets, situations that demand a quantitative comparison of sets seem considerably more difficult in the first school year. Textbooks represent the most important learning resource for elementary school mathematics teachers. However, research on their impact on students’ knowledge is limited. Hence, we examined textbooks’ role in students’ ability to model quantitative comparisons by analyzing the learning opportunities presented by four German textbooks for Grade 1 and by conducting a secondary analysis of a dataset based on 1513 students from 84 classes that used one of these textbooks. The results revealed differences in the textbooks’ topic-specific instructional quality as well as a significant relation between this quality and student achievement in quantitative comparisons.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>In an earlier essay in the Reviewing Policy section of this journal, I examined many of the major arguments for social justice teacher unionism. This combines both more traditional union concerns over wages, working conditions, professional autonomy, and respect with a much more concerted focus by unions on social justice issues in schools, communities, and the larger society. The importance of such a commitment and what it actually looks like is evident in the book under discussion here. Teacher Unions and Social Justice is one of a deservedly well-respected and growing series of volumes published by Rethinking Schools. The entire series constitutes substantive contributions to some of the most significant and contentious issues facing deeply committed educators. Through books such as Teacher Unions and Social Justice and other important publications, Rethinking Schools provides us with ways of combining the professional, political, and personal aspects of our lives and of coming together to build thicker forms of critically democratic education to defend a more robust vision of the common good.

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, I report the results of a study of a large-scale implementation of an evidence-based, objective-oriented approach to teaching via digital platforms among mathematics teachers in Denmark. The aim of the study was to investigate how these platforms affect the work of mathematics teachers and how emergent problems in this process can be addressed from an implementation perspective. This objective was achieved by applying concepts from the theory of instrumental genesis to analyze ethnographical data of teachers’ platform usage and data from participatory workshops. The results of the study indicate that the design of platforms is likely to conflict with the needs of mathematics teachers and thus I argue for the need of addressing such issues by supporting teachers in enacting innovations rather than by redesigning them. Furthermore, in the paper I suggest that future workshop is an adequate format to support such enactments.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The lecture format, while being the subject of much criticism, is still one of the most common formats of university mathematics teaching. This paper investigates lecturing as a means of modelling mathematical discourse, sometimes highlighted in the literature as one of its most important functions. The data analysed in the paper are taken from first-semester lectures given by seven mathematics lecturers at three Swedish universities, all concerning various aspects of the function concept. Analysis was carried out from a commognitive perspective, which distinguishes between object-level and meta-level discourse. Here I focus on two aspects of meta-level discourse: introducing new mathematical objects; and what counts as valid endorsement of a narrative. The analysis reveals a number of metarules concerning the modelling of mathematical reasoning and behaviour, both more general rules such as precision and consensus, and rules more specifically concerning construction and endorsement of narratives. The paper contributes to a small but growing body of empirical research on university mathematics teaching, and also lends empirical support to previous claims about the modelling aspect of mathematics lecturing, thus contributing to a deepened understanding of the lecture format and its potential role in future university mathematics teaching.</p>
