  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Conceptualizations of servingness must include an understanding of how racial ideologies shape Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Three Latinx scholars offer testimonios on our experiences as students, faculty, and researchers at teaching and research-intensive HSIs. From our testimonios, we found that practices of Blanqueamiento (Whitening of a population) and Mestizaje (racial mixture) operate at HSIs to flatten our understanding of Hispanics in U.S. society. To make sense of our testimonios within these HSI contexts and constraints, we applied an intersectional consciousness perspective on racialized organizations. Findings include Whiteness operating as a credential, legitimizing unequal resources, diminishing agency among minoritized groups, and continued use of Mestizaje (disguised as Hispanic) as a prevailing ideology. We provide considerations for HSI leaders, researchers, and administrators to elevate their intersectional consciousness and disrupt how HSIs contribute to essentialist notions of Latinxs.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This article examines how leaders in public, private, and hybrid educational systems manage competing pressures in their institutional environments. Across all systems, leaders responded to system-specific puzzles by (re)building systemwide educational infrastructures to support instructional coherence and framed these efforts as rooted in concerns about pragmatic organizational legitimacy. These efforts surfaced several challenges related to educational equity; leaders framed their responses to these challenges as tied to both pragmatic and moral organizational legitimacy. To address these challenges, leaders turned to an array of disparate government and nongovernment organizations in their institutional environments to procure and coordinate essential resources. Thus, the press for instructional coherence reinforced their reliance on an incoherent institutional environment.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Major host countries of international students such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have introduced post-study work rights as a strategic policy to both enhance their destination attraction and support international students’ post-graduation work experiences. While this policy is generally welcomed by both host institutions and international students, little is known about the support mechanism for the growing cohort of international student graduates who stay in their countries of study on temporary graduate visas, especially in relation to major concerns such as post-graduation work, visa application, and migration pathways. This article fills this gap in the existing literature. It is derived from a study that includes 50 interviews with university staff, agents, and international graduates. It uses positioning theory as a conceptual framework. The article assesses the role of universities in supporting their international alumni on temporary visas. The findings of the study raise concerns about the scope of university advice. It reports loopholes which legitimize the practices of migration agents to the conditions that enable them to exercise their exclusive rights in providing work-migration nexus advice to international students and graduates, making this cohort vulnerable to exploitation of unethical agents. The study provides the evidence base to develop recommendations for related stakeholders in improving the post-graduation experiences of international student graduates who remain in the host countries on temporary visas.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>When did sociologist Orlando Fals-Borda name his method Participatory Action Research (PAR), and what were the epistemological implications of this shift from action research to PAR? To address these questions, this article critically examines Fals-Borda’s ‘participatory turn’ —his epistemological shift from orthodox Marxism to the participatory paradigm—, which squarely underpinned the origins of PAR yet has hitherto remained unexplored in the literature. The article focuses on Fals-Borda’s transition from participation “by” to participation “with” the people, which occurred during a period of intense self-criticism after years of radical activism. Drawing on exhaustive archival research, it examines the collaborative systematisation of his method alongside an emerging constellation of participatory research practices. Thereby, it highlights the centrality of collaboration to the development of his work and demonstrates that Fals-Borda’s embrace of the participatory paradigm stemmed from rejecting the centrality of historical materialism in favour of a model of research which supports and sustains the conditions for collective analysis and action through harnessing the creativity and wisdom of marginalized peoples. It concludes that for all the innovations in tools and techniques of action-oriented methods, the ontology of participation is what fundamentally differentiates PAR from other instrumental or top-down forms of people’s participation in research.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School principals are facing greater challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic than they have ever faced, which has implications for whether they can conduct their work productively and remain in their jobs over the long term. This article draws on a unique, nationally representative, longitudinal panel of K–12 public school principals across the United States to examine principals’ self-reported resource needs and job demands during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as how those resource needs and demands are related to principals’ dissatisfaction and their intention to leave their job. Although principals’ reported resource needs (which increased over time) and teacher shortages were consistently related to dissatisfaction and intention to leave, various other job demands were predictors of dissatisfaction but not the intention to leave. These results have several implications for supporting and retaining principals as well as the teachers they serve.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>School rezoning, or redistricting, is the process by which school boards draw and redraw school attendance boundaries. These boundaries are key drivers of racial and economic school segregation but can also work to ameliorate it. Using a critical orientation to narrative policy analysis, this study examined the cultural politics of race and whiteness in an urban school district undergoing school rezoning. Drawing on semistructured interviews with 15 school leaders and community stakeholders, findings provide a lens for school leaders and policymakers to better understand how and to what extent race is imposed in school attendance boundary decisions. Our findings expand current literature on school rezoning by shedding new light on racial narratives embedded within the political process. We conclude with policy and practice implications.

Likely applicants to prekindergarten, kindergarten, and ninth grade were assigned to one of three groups. A “growth” group received lists (via U.S. mail, email, and text message) of the highest performing schools they could request. A “distance” group received lists of schools in their home geographic zone. A “control” group did not see any schools highlighted. The growth treatment led applicants to request more high-growth schools, with the strongest effects for high school choosers and families of students with disabilities. In addition, applicants’ first-choice requests appeared less malleable than their lower ranked requests. The distance treatment had only modest effects.

  Abstract
                  <p>It is commonly known that the letter M in the two acronyms HPM and STEM stands for mathematics, and it is natural to regard mathematics as playing a significant role in science education. However, it seems that appropriate attention is not usually accorded to the role of M in the area of STEM where mathematics tends to be marginalized. In fact, throughout history one witnesses STEM at work so that the discussion of HPM and STEM in parallel will be beneficial to both. In both the historical and pedagogical aspects, it may be worthwhile to note that history of mathematics affords some means to mirror several different mathematical worlds in the context of HPM in a pluralistic way in order to offer a fuller view of the subject. In this paper I examine this issue through sampling many examples gleaned from the history of mathematics, particularly the role of M in the world of science and technology.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Lesson study is a Japanese concept to improve teaching and learning mathematics through a particular form of activity in which a group of teachers works collaboratively to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on the proposed research lessons. Although lesson study is internationally acknowledged as providing key learning opportunities for teachers, there is limited information on post-lesson discussion and its contribution toward teachers’ professional growth. This study has the aim of describing the key features of post-lesson discussions. An entire group of teachers at a public elementary school in Japan participated in three lesson study cycles. During the post-lesson discussion in each cycle, the teachers were invited to write down what they believed was significant in the planned lesson and their comments regarding the lessons, for the discussion. The writings and comments were collected and analyzed. This method helped capture teachers’ ‘voices’ better compared to recordings of oral discussion. The results of the analyses of teachers’ writings and comments revealed that a major part of post-lesson discussions involved issues related to pedagogies, and teachers’ reflections tended to focus more on students’ thinking and mathematical topics over time as the cycles of lesson study proceeded. The results suggested that teachers’ professional growth can be related to their recognition of the importance of understanding students’ thinking and their perspectives on mathematics, in order to improve teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>One goal of inquiry-oriented instruction is student engagement with others’ mathematical ideas. This paper analyzes a relatively short episode in which students engaged with others’ ideas; the instructor facilitated engagement in order to support students in making mathematical progress. Students expressed some bafflement pertaining to the apparently paradoxical zero area and infinite perimeter of the Sierpiński triangle. The instructor strategically facilitated collective argumentation centered on their reasoning, resulting in several ideas that functioned-as-if-shared in the classroom community. In this report we capitalize on this classroom discussion to contribute to theory and methods for investigating the complex intersection of engagement and argumentation.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States provide substantial support for higher education through appropriations to public colleges and universities that can be used to maintain relatively low tuition levels and funds for financial aid. Higher education often receives disproportionate cuts during recessionary periods, and it faces potentially unprecedented reductions in coming years amid a pandemic that has left some states with revenue shortfalls. How states approach higher education cuts has the potential to exacerbate existing inequities among racially minoritized and low-income students and historically underfunded institution types. In this study, we document trends in higher education funding over time and use latent profile analysis to identify distinct approaches states have taken to higher education funding. We then examine the trajectories of higher education funding within each approach over time, particularly during prior recessions. We conclude by discussing the implications of each approach for equity, particularly in light of states’ early responses to the current economic downturn.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study we aimed to capture the characteristics of Chinese high-quality lessons from a lesson structure perspective, specifically addressing the elements of teaching activity and their sequence. Sixteen videotaped middle school mathematics lessons were selected from 224 daily lessons collected from urban districts in five cities located in the east, north, west, south, and center of China, approved by three independent parties (based on the scores of an instruction quality assessment and ratings by two experts). We found the following five common features among most mathematics lessons: (a) most lessons began with a review; (b) pure learning of mathematical knowledge was emphasized; (c) recurrent teaching activities related to mathematics problems ran throughout the lesson; (d) highlighting and summarizing important points during the lesson and summarizing the entire lesson at the end of the class were frequently used; and (e) teaching activities were dense and large in volume. The research findings paint a broad picture of high quality instruction (deepening our understanding of high-quality teaching in different cultures) and provide multiple choices for teachers.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Interest is vital for students’ learning in mathematics. Over the course of the Chinese mathematics curriculum reform in the past 30 years, cultivating students’ positive emotions, attitudes, and values has gained growing attention. In the current study we examined the trajectory of Chinese mathematics textbook development by analyzing textbook content that stimulated students’ mathematics learning interest through the curriculum reform in the past three decades. First, we selected textbooks that represent each phase of the curriculum reform (the Incubation Phase, the Reform Phase, and the Conditioning Phase). Then, taking eighth grade as an example, we used Hidi and Renninger’s model to identify content that focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. Finally, we explored the trajectory of textbook development in this aspect within the scope of curriculum reform. Results show that attention to strategies developing positive emotions and values towards mathematics has been emerging in recent times. Interest-stimulating strategies directed toward the triggering and maintaining of situational interest have been integrated more frequently into textbooks since the Reform Phase, while text content employing strategies that may lead to rote memorization is generally decreasing. Using Chinese curriculum reform as a context, this study demonstrates how mathematics textbooks have been revisioned and revised with a focus on stimulating students’ learning interest. The reform of mathematics education has been successfully implemented in more than thirty provinces in China, despite significant differences in geographical, cultural, and economic development. It is hoped that this study can provide practical evidence of interest stimulation in mathematics for the international education community.</p>
