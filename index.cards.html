  Abstract
                  <p>We report a study on mathematical literacy with special emphasis on health literacy. In particular, we identify and characterize the mathematical competencies that a citizen needs to interpret the official information on the COVID-19 pandemic as experienced in Mexico. To achieve this, we analyze the daily reports on the pandemic issued by the Mexican Ministry of Health, using the framework of mathematical competencies as a theoretical lens. Our results show that there are five necessary competencies to interpret the official information: mathematical communication, mathematical representation, mathematical symbols and formalism, mathematical modeling, and mathematical reasoning competency. After characterizing and illustrating these competencies, we close the paper with a reflection on the importance of mathematical literacy in a pandemic world.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Math anxiety is a negative affective reaction in situations concerning mathematics and is related to poor math performance and a lower mathematical self-concept. Gender differences appear in math anxiety even though gender differences in math abilities are non-existent or minimal in effect size. In the present study, gender and age differences in math anxiety, mental-rotation performance, and perceived mental-rotation performance are investigated as well as (perceived) mental-rotation performance as possible mediators of the relation between gender and math anxiety. Ninety-seven children (54 females) between 11 and 15 years and 84 undergraduate students (59 females) solved a mental-rotation test, rated their performance in this test, and filled out a questionnaire about math anxiety. Increasing gender differences with age were found for math anxiety, mental-rotation performance, and perceived mental-rotation performance. Mental-rotation performance and perceived mental-rotation performance were significant individual mediators for gender differences in math anxiety. Adequate measures should be discussed to enhance females’ mental-rotation abilities and their perception of these skills to reduce gender differences in math anxiety.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Cognitive neuroscience research is typically conducted in controlled laboratory environments and therefore its contribution to our understanding of learning in real-world environments is limited. In recent years, however, portable and wearable brain devices have become more readily available for classroom-based research. Complementing existing education research methods, these emerging technologies could provide information about learning processes that might not be reflected in classroom observations or learners’ self-reports. This essay critically evaluates the value added by portable brain technologies in education research and outlines a proposed research agenda, centered around questions related to student engagement, cognitive load, and self-regulation. We also address ethical concerns regarding student privacy and the potential misuse of students’ brain data.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This article examines the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on undocumented college students. Deploying an ecological framework, we situate students’ experiences within their families, communities, and educational institutions. We draw on qualitative and quantitative survey responses from 1,067 undocumented students attending California 4-year universities. Qualitative findings show that immigration status exacerbated the negative economic effects of the pandemic, leading to severe financial strains that had cascading negative effects on undocumented students’ academics and health. Regression analyses confirm the strong association between students’ preexisting economic insecurity and negative effects of the pandemic. Legal vulnerability and family strains moderated this relationship, but campus environment had little effect.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>The racial and linguistic diversity of U.S. classrooms has drawn attention to the intersecting dynamics of race, racism, and language learning in teacher education. While most studies in this vein focus on teachers, almost no research has focused on teacher educators themselves. Therefore, this study draws on interviews with teacher educators to document how they addressed—or more often, evaded—the topics of race and racism. Participants (n = 33) were instructors for state-mandated courses on teaching emergent bilinguals for general educators across the state of Massachusetts. Through the lens of poststructural discourse analysis, the findings of this study demonstrate that race-evasiveness is not a byproduct of passive omission, but instead involves active, discursive effort. These findings underscore the importance of individual and collective efforts to disrupt race-evasiveness, but also illustrate the limits of surface-level race-intentionality for advancing antiracism in teacher education.

  Abstract
                  <p>Russian culture developed under the burden of a series of totalitarian governments, a circumstance that, oddly, supported mathematics education. The Soviet period in particular saw a flowering of mathematical culture, the seeds of which have, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, been carried to the rest of Europe and America. A trickle of ideas, materials—and émigrés—has swollen to a powerful stream. Some of the heaviest influences have occurred in the field of extra-curricular education. We explore some of the ways that Russian and Soviet mathematical culture has fertilized this field. In particular, we look closely at the pivotal role of the professional mathematical communities, both in Russia and in America.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study investigates the relationship between children’s subitizing activity and their construction of arithmetic units. In particular, the study hypothesizes a positive association between children’s construction of subitized units and their construction of arithmetic units, and hypothesizes that children who can subitize larger units, such as five items, in kindergarten, are more likely to construct arithmetic units by the beginning of first grade. Data for this study were drawn from 3,660 children surveyed at the beginning of kindergarten in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and at the beginning of first grade in the following year. The children are from a single school district in the southwest United States. Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of constructing arithmetic units based on children’s earlier construction of subitized units. Findings provide evidence of a positive relationship between children’s construction of subitized units and arithmetic units, and, on average, children who have constructed subitized units at the beginning of kindergarten are more likely to construct arithmetic units by the beginning of first grade. Based on the findings, theoretical and instructional implications are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Most studies of mathematics teacher noticing employ information-processing-based models of noticing. While information processing has been used productively to research the cognitive requirements of noticing, critics have argued that these accounts conceptualise noticing as a relatively passive and mental act. This paper demonstrates how an alternative perception/action cycle model of noticing can draw attention to how teacher noticing is supported by active interaction with the classroom environment mid-lesson. Data from two primary mathematics lessons were gathered using a head-mounted camera technique. These data are analysed using the perception/action cycle model to demonstrate the model’s capacity to enable productive research. The model draws attention to aspects of teacher behaviour that support noticing that are given little weight when information processing informs analysis. By contrasting the noticing of one experienced and one beginning teacher, differences in the way that each teacher deployed their attention and looked for information mid-lesson can be ascertained. The experienced teacher took action that increased the likelihood that students would create mathematical representations that enabled perception of students’ mathematical thinking and deployed their attention so that they were more likely to be in the right place at the right time to notice. The perception/action cycle model draws attention to these under-researched aspects of mathematics teacher noticing.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>A core motivation for the widespread teacher evaluation reforms of the past decade was the belief that these new systems would promote teacher development through high-quality feedback. We examine this theory by studying teachers’ perceptions of evaluation feedback in Boston Public Schools and evaluating the district's efforts to improve feedback through an administrator training program. Teachers generally reported that evaluators were trustworthy, fair, and accurate but that they struggled to provide high-quality feedback. We find little evidence that the training program improved perceived feedback quality, classroom instruction, teacher self-efficacy, or student achievement. Our results illustrate the challenges of using evaluation systems as engines for professional growth when administrators lack the time and skill necessary to provide frequent, high-quality feedback.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, I present the eighteenth century’s polemic of Bernoulli and d’Alembert concerning the smallpox epidemic and a prevention method called inoculation. Through an analysis of the polemic and the related resources, I show that this historical debate has various interests for mathematics education; and more specifically it can help teachers to confront dilemmas emerging with the COVID-19 pandemic (for example if a teacher should talk about it in class or not, how to help students to interpret the statistical data and the mathematical models connected to the pandemic and more generally, how to deal with the confusions and concerns emerging in connection to the pandemic). I describe the documents related to the historical polemic as transitional objects, having a potential to reveal the teachers’ own professional or personal experiences, reflections and questions, and to stimulate dialogue with them on these issues. I illustrate this proposition by the presentation of an online reading seminar realized with a French group of teachers in April 2020.</p>
