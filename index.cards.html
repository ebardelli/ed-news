  Abstract
                  <p>Many international studies focus empirically on integrating the history of mathematics in mathematics education. Over the last 2 decades, some studies also revealed theoretical elements concerning the implementation of learning sessions and/or their didactical analysis and effectiveness. This paper has the aim of complementing these empirical studies with a more systematic approach in the French context. Defended for decades within the IREM (Institut de recherche sur l’enseignement des mathématiques), the history of mathematics is now officially introduced in the French curriculum. Nevertheless, is it really sufficient for teachers to change their habits by implementing the history of mathematics in their practices? To answer this question, I first present an unpublished survey with secondary school mathematics teachers (pupils from 10- to 18 years old) about the introduction of the history of mathematics in their classes. This survey allows the comparison of teachers’ desires (‘history of mathematics in potentiality’) and realities in classrooms (‘history of mathematics in actuality’). Then I focus on French mathematics textbooks (for pupils from 15- to 18 years old) in order to question their effectiveness as tools for the introduction of a historical perspective. I describe the historical/mathematical tasks available in these textbooks focusing on their reference to Fibonacci. Finally, I present a proposition to implement the history of mathematics in mathematics education starting from the textbooks, aiming to help mathematics teachers to redesign the tasks of their textbooks so as to be more relevant.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This work is part of an investigation conducted in Italy, which aims to explore the effects of instruction on secondary school students’ combinatorial reasoning. We gave a questionnaire adapted from Navarro-Pelayo’s research to two groups of students with and without instruction on combinatorics in order to analyse the students’ performances and the strategies used in their solutions, as well as the effect of instruction on the same. We present the results obtained in two permutation and two combination problems (each in the distribution and selection models). Permutation problems were found easier than combination problems, selection problems were found easier after instruction, and the instruction group obtained better results. We found differences in the main strategies used in both groups: enumeration and dividing a problem in parts was more common in the no-instruction group. The instruction group frequently relied on the use of a formula and the product rule.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>To anticipate and respond to the diverse ways of reasoning students with disabilities use to make sense in inclusive mathematics classrooms, special educators require a deep understanding of a diverse array of student thinking. Unfortunately, historic and contemporary data suggest that opportunities for special educators to develop this knowledge prior to classroom teaching are diminutive. Further inquiry is needed into pre-service experiences that might support growth in teachers’ knowledge. We present results from a US-based semester-long course grounded in neurodiversity and students’ mathematical thinking designed to improve 20 special educators’ pedagogical content knowledge. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to determine how the pre-service teachers anticipated students’ diverse mathematical thinking before and after experience in the course along with their propensity to adapt problems to respond to diversity during instruction. Furthermore, the pre-test to post-test changes in pre-service teachers’ anticipations of students’ problem-solving strategies and adaptations of problems were statistically significant. Implications for teacher preparation and future research are shared.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>As content-specific educational coaches, elementary mathematics specialists (EMSs) have emerged as school-based professionals who are needs-driven and work closely with school stakeholders in regard to mathematics teaching and learning. While leading mathematics education organizations have identified the specialized knowledge and skills required for EMS positions, how to best prepare these individuals is knowledge that the field is still exploring. This paper first presents a theoretical model for EMS preparation that aligns an emerging coaching tool, the Decision-Making Protocol for Mathematics Coaching (Baker &amp; Knapp, 2019, [DMPMC]) with the Professional Development Design Framework (Loucks-Horsley et al. in Designing professional development for teachers of science and mathematics, Corwin Press, 2010). The paper then presents a descriptive case study that examines the application of this model in an EMS preparation course. The findings indicate that assessing the coaching situation fostered administrative partnerships, revisiting goals increased specificity of anticipated outcomes, and applying research-informed practices increased EMS self-efficacy and advanced coaching agendas. Taken together, these findings suggest that integrating the DMPMC into an EMS preparation course led to positive changes in EMS candidate learning of professional development design. Notably, this is one of the first studies that documents the influence of a coaching education tool on EMS candidates’ professional development design.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this study, we address the issue of mathematics teachers' personal and professional responsiveness to changing circumstances, such as the shift in external demands made on teacher practice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For investigating a such delicate issue, we take a theoretical approach, which is quite novel in the field of mathematics education: Lacan's psychoanalytical lens. Specifically, we will use this psychoanalytical lens to analyze a case study focusing on a primary school teacher during the first lockdown in Italy, during which school was organized exclusively in the form of distance education. The analysis of the teacher’s crisis and the strategies she adopted to overcome this crisis give some suggestions about possible directions and issues to consider for future mathematics teacher training proposals.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>A relevant, well-crafted emergency plan can help schools most optimally return to normal following a disaster. During this time, educators find themselves facing unintended responsibilities like operating on the front lines of providing social-emotional support for their students. Researchers conducted 115 interviews with educators impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Matthew in Texas and North Carolina to assess their mental health and their school’s role in returning to normal. Findings suggest that emergency plans often did not take into account the social-emotional factors of recovery. This paper seeks to provide insight into the experiences of educators following a disaster and propose elements to consider in revising school emergency plans.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Field experiences during teacher preparation programs support teacher candidates in forming and reforming teacher identities through real-world teaching situations. Trying out teaching approaches with children, reflecting on practice, and collaborating with cooperating teachers support teacher candidates in building a teacher identity. However, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, public schools closed in many states, requiring that field placements either end or change significantly. This is a study of five teacher candidates in an early childhood teacher preparation program. These candidates’ field placement ended in March 2020, requiring that university faculty develop an alternative teaching placement. Using Bourdieusian theoretical concepts of habitus, field, and doxa, this study explores how the candidates perceived this change and how they were able to continue to reflect and build their teacher identities.

  Abstract
                  <p>Preventive efforts are necessary to reduce the risk for problem gambling among adolescents, especially among more at-risk youth. However, only a small proportion of the preventive initiatives implemented in the field of adolescent problem gambling are based on robust theoretical models and have been evaluated in their efficacy. By referring to the dual-process model of human functioning, especially to the mindware concept, the goal of this study was to develop and evaluate a school-based preventive intervention based on teaching probabilistic reasoning ability and explaining biases in reasoning with probability. Indeed, research with adolescents found that poor probabilistic reasoning ability is associated with gambling-related cognitive distortions that, in turn, are a risk factor for problem gambling. The study aim was to reduce gambling-related distortions by working on the concept of randomness and probability. A pre- and post-test design was performed with 72 adolescents randomly assigned to a Training group and a No Training group. Results showed a significant reduction of cognitive distortions at the post-test only in the Training group. Findings suggest that teaching probability can serve to reduce the susceptibility to gambling-related distortions and should be pointed out in the training process of the intervention providers in the gambling field.

  Abstract
                    <p>Practice-based pedagogies, such as representations of practice and approximations of practice, are increasingly common in mathematics teacher education. More needs to be known about how teacher candidates' (TCs') productions through such activities make visible the resources they bring to the work of teaching. In this paper, we highlight our use of “scripting tasks,” through which secondary mathematics TCs produced dialogues of classroom interactions and rationales for those scripts in response to a provided classroom scenario. We share how analyses of TCs' scripts and rationales can make visible a range of resources that TCs bring to the work of teaching—tools and practices, vision and dispositions of teaching, and understandings of students and content (Hammerness et al., 2005)—that inform how they respond to student contributions in whole-class discussions as a focal teaching practice. We illustrate a rich example and framework for analyzing TCs' responses to scripting tasks and offer implications for how such analyses can support teacher educators and researchers to make claims about TCs' learning and inform decisions about supports for TCs' development.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between teachers’ post-instruction noticing (PIN) and the quality of their mathematics instruction. We analyzed the conversations of elementary teachers around five coached lessons and scored their level of post-instruction noticing and the mathematical quality of the instruction of the lesson. We compared teachers’ PIN levels with their instructional quality, using scores from the Mathematical Quality of Instruction (MQI) rubric, for each coached lesson. There was both alignment and discrepancies between the level of PIN and MQI scores. Explorations of the cognitive and psychological constructs that seemed to influence teacher’s noticing showed that mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT), efficacy, beliefs, emotions, and identity was influential on teachers’ PIN although they seemed to influence teachers differently. In some cases, the constructs appeared to support attentiveness to students’ thinking and in other cases they did not. We discuss implications for professional development and future research on teachers’ noticing.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>This mixed methods study surveyed 209 K-12 special education teachers about their perceptions of preparedness to teach students with mental health needs that manifest internally (e.g., quiet distress, withdrawal, excessive worry). We used a construct-modeling approach to develop the survey instrument and establish evidence of validity, reliability, and fairness, and it included both multiple-choice questions, used for descriptive and regression analyses, and open-ended items, coded to identify key themes. Results indicated that special educators generally had low perceptions of preparedness to support students with internalizing needs. In addition, we found that participants possessed critical misconceptions about research-based practices for supporting students with these needs in the school context, and that differences in perceptions of preparedness were associated with teachers’ race and the grade level at which they taught.
