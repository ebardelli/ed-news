  Abstract
                  <p>In 2020, the emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic brought a drastic and sudden change in teaching practices, from the physical space of the classrooms to the virtual space of an e-environment. In this paper, through a qualitative analysis of 44 collected essays composed by Italian mathematics teachers from primary school to undergraduate level during the spring of 2020, we investigate how the Italian teachers perceived the changes due to the unexpected transition from a face-to-face setting to distance education. The analysis is carried out through a double theoretical lens, one concerning the whole didactic system where the knowledge at stake is mathematics and the other regarding affective aspects. The integration of the two theoretical perspectives allows us to identify key elements and their relations in the teachers’ narratives and to analyze how teachers have experienced and perceived the dramatic, drastic, and sudden change. The analysis shows the process going from the disruption of the educational setting to the teachers’ discovery of key aspects of the didactic system including the teacher’s roles, a reflection on mathematics and its teaching, and the attempt to reconstruct the didactic system in a new way.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The world is now facing the most severe health, social, and economic event of the last hundred years, which has made the need to acquire statistical thinking to interpret the information disseminated on a daily basis by the media clear to society. This article proposes a discussion on the role that statistics education might play in supporting the acquisition of such knowledge, contributing to the development of critical citizens, aware of their social responsibility. In this context, we present examples of curves and other charts to demonstrate how to use the several levels defined by experts in reading and interpreting the charts. At a more advanced level, these examples will allow discussion on the impacts of this epidemic on the most vulnerable population in Brazil. The charts presented reveal a great regional inequality, suggesting that mortality due to the virus is distinguished by region and micro-region when considering access to hospital beds. The examples signpost ways for educators to be able to develop projects or research based on the discussion on the reality of the pandemic, the necessary public policies, and how political coordination grounded on science and on a humanitarian vision would have mitigated the Brazilian tragedy.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted mathematics teachers with the challenge of developing alternative teaching practices—in many cases at a distance through digital technology—because schools were closed. To investigate what distance practices in secondary mathematics education have emerged and how teachers experienced them, we set out online questionnaires in Flanders—the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium—, Germany, and the Netherlands. The questionnaire focused on teaching practices, teacher beliefs, didactics, and assessment. Data consisted of completed questionnaires by 1719 mathematics teachers. Results show that the use of video conferencing tools increased massively, while the use of mathematics-specific tools that teachers used before the lockdown reduced substantially. Further findings are that teachers' confidence in using digital technologies increased remarkably during the lockdown and that their experiences and beliefs only marginally impacted their distance learning practices. Also, we observed some differences between the three countries that might be explained by differences in educational policies and in technological facilities and support. For future research, it would be relevant to investigate long-term changes in teachers’ practices, as well as students’ views and experiences related to the teacher’s practices.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>With the looming impacts of COVID-19 on district budgets, the growth of school choice options, and population shifts across urban, suburban, and rural contexts, an increasing number of districts have closed schools and more districts are expected to follow this trend. Rich scholarship has examined school closures; however, this field of research is limited in scope and methodological approach, and overwhelmingly focuses on the mass urban school closures of the mid-2010s. This offers a timely opportunity to consider new directions in the field. In this article, we identify trends in the scholarship on school closures by examining the empirical research in this area over nearly two decades. We conclude by offering a research agenda for future scholarship on school closures.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Leveraging achievement data measured in the fall and spring of kindergarten through eighth grade for 840,000 students attending 8,800 public schools, we report novel evidence on how achievement and growth patterns differ between rural and nonrural schools. Rural students start kindergarten slightly ahead of nonrural students but fall behind by middle school. The divergence is driven by larger summer losses for rural students. In both rural and nonrural schools, we provide additional evidence that Black–White achievement gaps widen during the school year. These findings highlight the importance of seasonal learning patterns in interpreting rural school performance.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Theories of learning developed in education and psychology for the past 100 years are woefully inadequate to support the design of schools and classrooms that foster deep learning and equity. Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners’ full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people’s lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Theories of market-based school reform suggest that teacher labor markets may be inefficient because schools lack autonomy to incentivize performance in hiring, retention, and compensation. We test this empirically by comparing teacher exits in the deregulated market of New Orleans with neighboring traditional school districts. We find that the relationship between teacher performance and retention is stronger in the deregulated market. We also find positive associations between salary and performance, but only when teachers transfer from one charter school to another. While teacher retention is more closely tied to performance in New Orleans, this did not yield a net gain in teacher quality, because new teachers in New Orleans were of lower average quality than their peers in neighboring districts.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Taking the school bus has long been an integral part of the school experience in the U.S. However, not much is known about how school transportation relates to getting to school each day, particularly for students with disabilities. This study used ECLS-K: 2011 to explore two issues. First, we examined what characteristics are associated with taking the school bus, comparing students with and without disabilities. Second, we evaluated the link between taking the school bus and absenteeism for these groups. In the first set of findings, school bus taking is differentiated by student and family characteristics, as well as by urbanicity. We find no major differences in characteristics associated with taking the bus between students with disabilities and students without. As for the second set of findings, students with more common disability diagnoses had fewer absences compared to both students without disabilities as well as those with lower incidence diagnoses, suggesting that taking the bus is related to better attendance behaviors for some students with disabilities. Implications are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical modelling competencies have become a prominent construct in research on the teaching and learning of mathematical modelling and its applications in recent decades; however, current research is diverse, proposing different theoretical frameworks and a variety of research designs for the measurement and fostering of modelling competencies. The study described in this paper was a systematic literature review of the literature on modelling competencies published over the past two decades. Based on a full-text analysis of 75 peer-reviewed studies indexed in renowned databases and published in English, the study revealed the dominance of an analytical, bottom-up approach for conceptualizing modelling competencies and distinguishing a variety of sub-competencies. Furthermore, the analysis showed the great richness of methods for measuring modelling competencies, although a focus on (non-standardized) tests prevailed. Concerning design and offering for fostering modelling competencies, the majority of the papers reported training strategies for modelling courses. Overall, the current literature review pointed out the necessity for further theoretical work on conceptualizing mathematical modelling competencies while highlighting the richness of developed empirical approaches and their implementation at various educational levels.</p>

                  <p>Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy development and individual decision-making. In invoking exponential growth, mathematical modelling, statistical analysis, and the like, these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning. Yet data visualizations are social texts, authored from specific points of view, that narrate particular, and often consequential, stories. Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective, reliable, and neutral. The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics, including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view. We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts: mathematical formatting (what gets quantified, measured, and how), framing (how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization), and narrating (which stories the data visualization tells, its potential impacts and limits). This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting, reframing and renarrating. We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19. We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations, beyond this set of examples.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>From 2005 to 2015, the number of Black teachers in Michigan dropped by 48%, substantially exceeding declines in the corresponding K–12 Black student population. These teacher losses are an acute phenomenon within a broader national context of deurbanization of K–12 student populations away from those districts with the largest and most established faculties of color. Districts receiving large numbers of incoming Black students hired few Black teachers over the period, leading to marked declines in Black student exposure to Black educators, and Black employment gains since 2016 have generally been in areas where Black teachers were already employed. We discuss the historical conditions under which Michigan’s Black faculties were established and multiple forward-looking challenges to building and sustaining Black faculties in geographically diffuse populations.

  Abstract
                  <p>Teaching mathematical modeling is a demanding task. Thus, fostering teachers’ competencies in this regard is an essential component of teacher education. Recent conceptualizations of teachers’ competencies include situation-specific skills based on the concept of noticing, which is of particular interest for the spontaneous reactions needed when teaching mathematical modeling. The study described in this paper aims to analyze the development of a video-based instrument for measuring teachers’ noticing competencies within a mathematical modeling context and obtain evidence for the validity of the instrument. Three kinds of validity are examined in three different studies: content validity, elemental validity and construct validity. Indicators for content validity could be found through different expert ratings and implementation with the target group, where participants were able to perceive all relevant aspects. The qualitative analysis of participants’ reasoning, which is consistent with the coded level, indicates elemental validity. Moreover, the results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest construct validity with one overall factor of noticing competence within a mathematical modeling context. Taken together, these studies imply a satisfactory validity of the video-based instrument.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>State and national school accountability policies situate preventing chronic absenteeism on par with meeting state standardized test benchmarks. We question relying on school attendance as both a component of accountability policies and a means of enhancing equity in schools. Our research suggests out-of-school factors unrelated to missed instruction account for most of the associations between absences and test score achievement—with unexcused absences driving those associations. Excessive absences—and particularly unexcused absences—don’t harm students mainly through missed instruction. Instead, they reflect out-of-school harms students endure that have produced inequalities for years—and will continue to do so even if students show up or parents call in.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This essay argues that contemporary debates about the role of practice in teacher education run the risk of reproducing mind/body, thought/action dualisms. Absent these binaries, practice is understood as always theoretical, principled, and contextualized and knowledge and identity are understood as always embodied and enacted. The author discusses nonbinary theories of practice and their application in teacher education scholarship within both historical and political contexts. The essay argues that the practice turn in teacher education might be leveraged to enhance the field’s intersectional imagination and to eschew the polarities and linearities the field has inherited from Western enlightenment philosophy.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Objectives: This study examines the effectiveness of a formal financial education program for improving the financial literacy of primary school children and how this effectiveness is influenced by informal financial education provided by parents, such as giving pocket money and discussing money matters. Method: A quasi field experiment was carried out at the Museum of Saving in Turin where children participated in a financial education program (the treatment). The first two out of three classes that arrived at the museum were assigned to the treatment group and the third one to the comparison group. Difference-in-differences models are estimated using financial literacy data from a pretest taken about 1 week before the visit to the museum and a posttest taken on the day of the visit; just before starting with the program at the museum for the comparison group and just after program completion for the treatment group. Results: In line with previous studies, we find that our formal financial education program had a positive effect on the financial literacy of primary school children. The empirical findings provide weak evidence that this effect of formal financial education is stronger for children who received informal financial education from their parents. Conclusions: Our study contributes to the previous literature by presenting further evidence that a short extra-curricular course can be effective in increasing economic and financial literacy among students. Furthermore, we present suggestive evidence—worth of further research—that informal financial education can reinforce the effect of formal financial education.J.E.L. Codes: A29, C93, G40

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Drawing on data from the RAND American School Leader Panel 2020 COVID-19 Distance Learning Surveys, we analyze principal perceptions of school preparedness for distance learning with a specific focus on how different school types (e.g., rural, urban, and suburban) and student groups (e.g., students with mild disabilities, English learner students) were impacted by rapid school closure. These findings have important implications for how state education agencies, policymakers, and districts plan to address the growth of opportunity gaps among student groups. In addition, findings have important implications for education leadership and policy researchers seeking to design and implement studies to inform next generation policy and practice.
