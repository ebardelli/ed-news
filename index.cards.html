  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Using unique statewide panel data from Tennessee, we describe instructional coach (IC) and teacher peer observer (TPO) distributions in terms of their teaching expertise and observable school and district characteristics. The evidence suggests ICs are more likely to work in districts with lower-performing teachers while working in schools with higher-performing teachers. District characteristics largely determine where TPOs work. We also find that ICs and TPOs possess relatively more teaching expertise than classroom teachers and that these positive differences grow in magnitude as the concentration of economically disadvantaged students in a school rises.

  Abstract
                    <p>While patterning was commonly seen as evidence of mathematical thinking, interdisciplinary interest has recently increased due to pattern-recognition applications in artificial intelligence. Within two empirical studies, we analyze the analogical-transfer capability of primary school students when completing three types of bi-dimensional patterns, namely, numerical, discrete geometric, and continuous geometric. We found that the mechanisms involved in analogical transfer for continuing sequential patterns are based on two complementary cognitive processes: decoding and adapting. In addition, at a basic level of processing, students activate one of the operational tools of shape recognition or counting, and based on it, they find a surface analogy that leads them to use isometric transformations or one-dimensional development for continuing the given pattern. At a more complex level of processing, students activate both shape recognition and counting and are thus able to apply a filter of processing that uncovers a deep-structure analogy, which allows cognitive framing of the problem and leads to coherent 2D developments within the understood conceptual frame. At a more advanced level of processing, students can use a refined filter not only to uncover a deep-structure analogy but also to use an external language to verbalize that analogy, and consequently, to find 2D developments that trigger changes in cognitive framing, showing that pattern generation is a creative activity. Teaching and learning implications are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In the age of artificial intelligence where standard problems are increasingly processed by computers, creative problem solving, the ability to think outside the box is in high demand. Collaboration is also increasingly significant, which makes creative collaboration an important twenty-first-century skill. In the research described in this paper, we investigated students’ collaborative creative process in mathematics and explored the collaborative creative process in its phases. Since little is known about the collaborative creative process, we conducted an explorative case study, where two students jointly worked on a multiple solution task. For in-depth insight into the dyad’s collaborative creative process, we used a novel research design in mathematics education, DUET SRI: both students wore eye-tracking glasses during their collaborative work for dual eye-tracking (DUET) and they each participated in a subsequent stimulated recall interview (SRI) where eye-tracking videos from their joint work served as stimulus. Using an inductive data analysis method, we then identified the phases of the students’ collaborative creative process. We found that the collaborative creative process and its phases had similarities to those previously found for solo creative work, yet the process was more complex and volatile and involved different branches. Based on our findings, we present a tentative model of the dyad’s collaborative process in its phases, which can help researchers and educators trace and foster the collaborative creative process more effectively.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In mathematics classrooms, educators encourage both creativity and collaboration. In the current study we investigated the dialogical moves that made up the interactions of three groups of post high-school students who worked on an open-ended mathematics task. The aim of this study was to characterize collective strategic pathways that can lead to different creativity products, and the possible impact of leadership styles and dialogical moves on those pathways. Collective strategic flexibility was defined as the number of strategies used by the group. Three strategy paths were found, namely, a disjointed strategy path, an emerging strategy path, and a straightforward strategy path. Dialogical moves such as asking for help, receiving clarifications, and explicating strategies, led to fluency. Elaborating mathematical explanations led to originality. Strategic flexibility was supported by evaluating strategies. Group leadership styles also contributed to varying amounts of cooperation and collaboration, in turn furthering different aspects of creativity. Findings indicated that cooperative collectives can lead to original unpredictable solutions. When a group is more collaborative, collective strategic flexibility may increase. When there is a mix, and students collaborate in a way that ensures that all can contribute, then collective fluency is promoted.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>For a century and a half, the scene of mathematics competitions underwent a remarkable transformation from isolated and geographically scattered events to a full-scale and a full-featured vibrant global ecosystem comprising an impressive variety of competitions, school students, university students, teachers, mentors, scientists, schools, universities, research institutions, journals, websites, civil society organizations, educational authorities, parents, etc. The evolution, the current state, the functioning of this ecosystem as well as its role for the identification and development of talent, its impact on the educational process, and the institutions involved with it, is briefly reflected on. Some relatively new online competitions are presented that cultivate the use of dynamic geometry software systems for a deeper understanding of mathematical facts and phenomena, and for finding approximate numerical solutions to problems that are not part of a typical school curriculum, but often arise from real-life practice.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Creativity has been identified as a key characteristic that allows students to adapt smoothly to rapid societal and economic changes in the real world. However, Chinese students appear to perform less well in mathematical problem-solving and problem-posing abilities, which are strongly connected to mathematical creativity. Mathematical modelling has recently been introduced as one of the six core competencies in the Chinese mathematical curriculum and is built on students’ ability to solve real-world problems using mathematical means. As mathematical modelling is characterised by openness regarding the understanding of complex real-world problems and the complex relationship between the real world and mathematics, for the strengthening of creativity, mathematical modelling activities seem to be adequate to accomplish this purpose. In this paper, we describe a study with 71 upper secondary school students, 50 pre-service mathematics teachers, and 66 in-service mathematics teachers, based on an extended didactical framework regarding mathematical modelling as a creativity-demanding activity. The results of the study indicate a significant correlation between modelling competencies and creativity aspects. Especially significant correlations between the adequacy of the modelling approaches and the two creativity aspects of usefulness and fluency could be identified, as well as a significant negative correlation between usefulness and originality. The results of the correlational analysis of relationships among the four criteria were not always consistent in the three participant groups. Overall, the results have implications for the promotion of creativity for various expertise groups and demonstrate the dependency of the modelling activities on the mathematical knowledge of the participants and the mathematical topic with which they are dealing.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The present study had the purpose of investigating empirically the structure and relationships among mathematical imagination, mathematical knowledge and mathematical mindset. The three factors are constituent parts of the Innovation Engine model by Seelig (inGenius: A Crash course on creativity, HarperOne-2012) and can influence creative thinking. The participants were two hundred seventeen sixth grade students from three urban and eight rural primary schools. The data were collected by administering a mathematical imagination test, a test measuring mathematical knowledge and a questionnaire capturing their mathematical mindset. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied through Smart PLS in order to examine empirically the proposed path model describing the relationships among the three factors contributing to mathematical creative thinking, namely, imagination, knowledge and mindset. The data analysis yielded that the proposed model of the paper fulfilled all evaluation criteria of partial least squares structural equation modeling. In short, students’ mathematical knowledge could be explained directly and moderately by their mathematical mindset. In addition, mathematical imagination could be explained directly and to a large extent by mathematical knowledge and indirectly by mathematical mindset. Finally, the main implications for mathematics teaching are discussed and potential research directions are suggested.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>We discuss classroom activity comprised of small groups of students collaboratively tinkering with programs of dynamically manipulable figural models, posing problems regarding their mathematical properties and behaviors. We analyzed data from students’ discourse taken from two classroom interventions employing a framework of creative mathematical action-in-context, in order to study student-generated ideas. We approached students' actions taking a fallible mathematics epistemological approach and employed constructionist and social creativity theory in our analysis. Our results show that student agency in the disciplined field of mathematical thinking need not curtail the potential for undisciplined creative action: on the contrary, given appropriate tools and discursive environments it may in fact create space for actions with creative potential for students. On their own accord, the students in the study used generalized number theory to resolve engineering a parallelogram that can never be a rectangle, and used recursion to program a model embedding geometrical progression in order to create a spiral based on the golden ratio.</p>

                      Methods
                      <p>To examine how student’s levels of general creativity were related to their performance on different types of geometrical problems, a geometry test with diverse problems was administered to a sample of 1665 Dutch students from third to sixth grade, as well as a creativity test. The geometry test consisted of four closed-ended routine problems, six closed-ended non-routine problems (related to a visual artwork) and four open-ended non-routine problems (multiple solutions problems). The Test of Creative Thinking—Drawing Production was used to measure students’ creativity. Multivariate multilevel analyses were conducted to take the nested structure of the data into account.</p>
                    
                    
                      Results
                      <p>The results showed that creativity was a significant predictor of students’ performance on all types of geometrical problems, but most strongly associated with performance on open-ended non-routine problems, suggesting that students with higher levels of creativity perform better in solving geometry problems in general, but especially in geometry problems asking for multiple solutions.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The mental health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on PK–12 youth is likely an urgent and enduring concern, yet research on this topic is still emerging. To synthesize current knowledge, the researchers conducted a systematic review of empirical studies exploring the mental health impacts of COVID-19. Five themes emerged across 104 included studies: (a) the pandemic proved widely disruptive to PK–12 youth; (b) there was a clear connection between the mental health of caregivers (e.g., parents) and children; (c) the pandemic broadly increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in PK–12 youth; (d) students were particularly affected on the basis of age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and previous mental health or disability diagnosis; and (e) youth demonstrated negative and positive coping strategies and even saw some positive mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Our 2020 Educational Researcher article, “The Imperative of Social Foundations to (Urban) Education Research and Practice,” emphasizes three particular social foundations of education (SFE) subdisciplines (sociology of education, history of education, and philosophy of education) to demonstrate the strength and necessity of SFE as a multi-perspectival approach to resolving persistent education justice dilemmas. In their technical comment, Aydarova et al. (2021) insist that our article potentially facilitates “erasure of SFE’s complexity and interdisciplinarity” (p. 1). They, like us, care deeply that SFE be understood as indispensable to advancing racial justice in and beyond education research, policy, and practice. These scholars foreground the invaluable contributions of anthropology of education to oppose racism and accentuate justice-oriented education alternatives. This essay responds to the technical comment by clarifying what we find to be a fundamental misinterpretation of our argument and, ultimately, its scholarly purpose. Not only do we contend with our colleagues’ concern that our work is reductionist, we demonstrate how Aydarova et al.’s urgent call to foreground SFE’s interdisciplinary nature further underscores the central argument made in our 2020 paper.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States and broad-access colleges are rapidly scaling corequisite coursework—a model where students concurrently enroll in college-level and developmental coursework—in response to dismal completion rates in traditional “developmental” sequences. At community colleges, evidence suggests that corequisite reforms can dramatically improve students’ completion of required college-level courses, but colleges often implement new programing and sequences with limited information. We analyzed administrative data from Texas community colleges implementing a statewide corequisite mandate. Our results illustrate (a) how colleges structured corequisite courses in response to the statewide mandate and (b) how corequisite coursework characteristics predicted student outcomes. Our results suggest that some corequisite coursework elements—including mixed-ability college-level classes, higher credits for the developmental education (dev-ed) corequisite support course, and using the same instructor across both the college-level and dev-ed course—improve students’ probability of passing college-level math, though these course design elements do not appear to predict long-term outcomes like persistence in college.

  Abstract
                    <p>Relationships between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity have been widely studied, but few studies are available for primary school age. For an investigation in this age group, it seems appropriate to use a content area that not only has high relevance for mathematics and special potentials for creativity, but also requires only a little knowledge and is easily accessible. We therefore investigated whether mathematically gifted primary school students differ from non-gifted ones in high creativity in dealing with mathematical patterns and structures. This question was explored in an interview study in which 24 third graders were asked to invent as many different figural patterns as possible, which enabled creative mathematical activity also by combining arithmetic and geometric aspects. A detailed qualitative analysis of the data revealed among other results several types of flexibility concerning the invention of patterns. The selection of students ensured that all participants performed well to very well in regular mathematics classes and that 14 of them could additionally be assumed to be mathematically gifted based on a specific test. This allowed a comparison of both subgroups. Results indicate a high correspondence between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity concerning the invention of figural patterns.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>One of the well-known approaches to creativity differentiates between creative person, process, product, and press. In the study presented in this paper we focus on creative process and product associated with Problem Posing through Investigation (PPI) by experts in mathematical problem solving. We link the creative process to creativity of PPI strategies and the creative product to PPI outcomes (i.e., strategy creativity and outcome creativity). Furthermore, we draw a connection between the openness of tasks and their power for the evaluation of strategy creativity and outcome creativity, demonstrate the aptness of PPI tasks for the evaluation of both types of creativity, and examine the connections between them. The model for the evaluation of creativity that we used in this study, was initially designed and validated using analysis of problem-solving strategies when solving multiple solution tasks. We previously extended the model to evaluation of PPI outcomes, and we here demonstrate its implementation to evaluation of creativity of PPI strategies. To examine connections between creativity of PPI strategies and creativity of PPI outcomes, we focused on PPI by eight experts in mathematical problem solving who were members or candidates of the Israeli IMO team. We present empirical evidence for the distinctions between strategy creativity and outcome creativity, and for the connections between them. We analyzed strategy creativity as a unique characteristic of problem-solving experts. We found that higher strategy creativity does not necessarily lead to higher outcome creativity, and that a high level of strategy originality correlates with outcome flexibility. We conclude that creative product and creative process are two distinct characteristics of cognitive processing linked to creativity-directed problem solving.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this special issue we introduce the state of the art of empirical studies on creativity in mathematics and mathematics education. To do so we conducted a retrospective analysis of empirical studies on mathematical creativity with special attention to the studies conducted during the last decade. In the paper we present a brief survey of research on mathematical creativity up to 2009 and then a detailed review of empirical studies performed during the past decade. We note an optimistic development of attention paid to mathematical creativity in schools. A systematic search conducted to examine research on creativity in mathematics education journals and research in the field of mathematics in creativity-related journals, yielded 49 papers that described empirical studies on creativity in mathematics education. The retrospective analysis examined the following: (a) the main goals of the studies; (b) conceptual frameworks used by the researchers; (c) research methodologies; and (d) tools and tasks. Of these, 18 studies examined the relationships between creativity in mathematics and other characteristics, 25 were on creativity related to instructional practices and mathematical tasks, and 6 studies investigated teachers’ creativity-related conceptions and competencies. Of these studies, 29 used quantitative methodologies, 10 of which integrated analysis for problem solving or problem posing strategies or outcomes. Ten additional studies employed qualitative methodology (mainly content analysis of lesson observations). We conclude the paper with a short review of papers in this special issue, and outline directions for future research on creativity in mathematics (education).</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, the construct of ‘uncertainty’ in professional mathematics is investigated in relation to mathematical creativity. Specific focus is on ‘Big C’ research mathematicians’ conceptions of what uncertainty means and ways in which it influences their research. Based on the hypothesis that uncertainty is both a catalyst and a necessary condition for creativity, a qualitative research design was used to obtain and analyze data from a 4-year study involving 18 research mathematicians who were at the forefront of their research domains. Data analysis using analytic induction confirmed the hypothesis that uncertainty plays an important role as a catalyst of mathematical creativity. The emergent categories from qualitative analysis revealed a dialectic or tension between (1) logic versus heuristics (synthetic versus analytic), (2) learner-researcher and researcher-learner transition, (3) axiom tweaking versus constraints. The findings of the study indicate that textbooks, unexpected moments, risk taking, and a community of support play a crucial role and characterize the interplay of uncertainty with mathematical creativity. The schema for understanding the dialectics of uncertainty sheds new light on an hitherto unexplored aspect of mathematical creativity, namely, uncertainty, vital for the development of mathematicians as researchers in addition to the growth of their discipline.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Even after many decades of productive research, problem solving instruction is still considered ineffective. In this study we address some limitations of extant problem solving models related to the phenomenon of insight during problem solving. Currently, there are two main views on the source of insight during problem solving. Proponents of the first view argue that insight is the consequence of analytic thinking and a sequence of conscious and stepwise steps. The second view suggests that insight is the result of unconscious processes that come about only after an impasse has occurred. Extant models of problem solving within mathematics education tend to highlight the first view of insight, while Gestalt inspired creativity research tends to emphasize the second view of insight. In this study, we explore how the two views of insight—and the corresponding set of models—can describe and explain different aspects of the problem solving process. Our aim is to integrate the two different views on insight, and demonstrate how they complement each other, each highlighting different, but important, aspects of the problem solving process. We pursue this aim by studying how expert and novice mathematics students worked on two ill-defined mathematical problems. We apply both a problem solving model and a creativity model in analyzing students’ work on the two problems, in order to compare and contrast aspects of insight during the students’ work. The results of this study indicate that sudden and unconscious insight seems to be crucial to the problem solving process, and the occurrence of such insight cannot be fully explained by problem solving models and analytic views of insight. We therefore propose that extant problem solving models should adopt aspects of the Gestalt inspired views of insight.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Divergent thinking (DT), which involves finding new possibilities and seeing the familiar from a new perspective, has been stressed in mathematical creativity education. However, convergent thinking (CT), which involves searching for a correct single answer, has been relatively understudied in relation to developing mathematical creativity. Moreover, how to relate the two thinking modes when facilitating mathematical creativity in daily teaching has rarely been studied. In this study, we propose a framework of dynamic interplay between DT and CT, which we call DT/CT dynamics, that characterizes the creative learning process in the classroom, and to provide an example we analyze research results from two classes from our 3-year longitudinal study with an experienced teacher, in order to demonstrate the framework. Findings indicate that there were significant differences between the two classes in how DT/CT dynamics worked with respect to three aspects, namely, authority distribution, micro-level transition, and macro-level goals. This paper provides a new integrative framework that combines extant work on the psychology of DT/CT with ongoing research in mathematics education, which offers a meaningful lens to capture the way mathematical creativity is pursued effectively in everyday mathematics classrooms. In particular, the study provides a reinterpretation of the theoretical perspectives of Tan and Sriraman (2017) on creativity and provides an analytical tool that enables an understanding of creative learning processes in everyday mathematics classrooms in relation to DT/CT dynamics.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematical creativity is considered beneficial for learning mathematics. However, research studies that provide empirical evidence of students’ mathematical creativity in regular mathematics classrooms are relatively scarce. This study explores the idea of mini-creativity (mini-c), which is defined as the creative processes involved in the construction of personal knowledge and understanding. The aim of the study is the identification and characterization of mini-c instances when students are first introduced to the arithmetic mean concept. In total, 97 Grade 6 students participated in a technologically enhanced instructional program which was developed according to the principles of the theoretical framework ‘personalised mathematics and mathematics inquiry’ (PMMI). The analysis of the results suggests that the learning environment supported the development of mini-c. From students’ worksheets and classroom observations, three categories of mini-c instances were identified and characterized, as follows: (a) building insight and abstractness of a mathematical concept; (b) creating, manipulating, and connecting representations; and (c) expressing flexible thinking.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Students’ issues dealing with reflection tasks, especially with inclined mirror lines, are widely known. Previous research conducted with primary school students mainly focussed on task difficulty and students’ outcomes, especially their errors of reflection. Little is known about which not obviously sustainable understanding of reflection leads to what kind of errors. To address this issue, the purpose of this study is to explore which approaches students use in their solution finding processes when dealing with reflection tasks. We also investigated whether there was a relationship between the students’ approaches and correct or incorrect solution products. This article discusses a task-based interview study focussing on approaches used in the students’ solution process of four reflection tasks. To gather data, 42 interviews with students at the end of primary school in Germany were conducted. For the analysis, a category system with the categories “properties of reflection,” “holistic approaches,” “gestures and actions illustrating the process of reflection,” and “mental images illustrating the process of reflection,” was developed and validated. We observed that there is a relation between the approaches used by the students during their process of solving reflection tasks and their solution products. The observed relationship between the approaches applied during the solution processes and the solutions themselves leads to the assumption that the approaches the students used reveal varying degrees of mathematical understanding of reflection. As emphasized in the discussion of the results, it is important to take a differentiated look on the students’ solution products and the importance of adequate instruction methods.</p>
