  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Respondents’ problem-solving behaviors comprise behaviors that represent complicated cognitive processes that are frequently systematically tied to one another. Biometric data, such as visual fixation counts (FCs), which are an important eye-tracking indicator, can be combined with other types of variables that reflect different aspects of problem-solving behavior to quantify variability in problem-solving behavior. To provide comprehensive feedback and accurate diagnosis when using such multimodal data, the present study proposes a multimodal joint cognitive diagnosis model that accounts for latent attributes, latent ability, processing speed, and visual engagement by simultaneously modeling response accuracy (RA), response times, and FCs. We used two simulation studies to test the feasibility of the proposed model. Findings mainly suggest that the parameters of the proposed model can be well recovered and that modeling FCs, in addition to RA and response times, could increase the comprehensiveness of feedback on problem-solving-related cognitive characteristics as well as the accuracy of knowledge structure diagnosis. An empirical example is used to demonstrate the applicability and benefits of the proposed model. We discuss the implications of our findings as they relate to research and practice.

  Abstract
                  <p>Offering explanations is a central part of teaching mathematics, and understanding those explanations is a vital activity for learners. Given this, it is natural to ask what makes a good mathematical explanation. This question has received surprisingly little attention in the mathematics education literature, perhaps because the field has no agreed method by which explanation quality can be reliably assessed. In this paper, we explore this issue by asking whether mathematicians and undergraduates agree with each other about explanation quality. A corpus of 10 explanations produced by 10 mathematicians was used. Using a comparative judgement method, we analysed 320 paired comparisons from 16 mathematicians and 320 from 32 undergraduate students. We found that both mathematicians and undergraduates were able to reliably assess the quality of a set of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the assessments were largely consistent across the two groups. Implications for theories of mathematical explanation are discussed. We conclude by arguing that comparative judgement is a promising technique for exploring explanation quality.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Understanding of the equal sign is associated with early algebraic competence in the elementary grades and equation-solving success in middle school. Thus, it is important to find ways to build foundational understanding of the equal sign as a relational symbol. Past work promoted a conception of the equal sign as meaning “the same as”. However, recent work highlights another dimension of relational understanding—a substitutive conception, which emphasizes the idea that an expression can be substituted for another equivalent one. This work suggests a substitutive conception may support algebra performance above and beyond a sameness conception alone. In this paper, we share a subset of results from an online intervention designed to foster a relational understanding of the equal sign among fourth and fifth graders (n = 146). We compare lessons focused on a sameness conception alone and a dual sameness and substitutive conception to each other, and we compare both to a control condition. The lessons influenced students’ likelihood of producing and endorsing sameness and substitutive definitions of the equal sign. However, the impact of the lessons on students’ approaches to missing value equations was less clear. We discuss possible interpretations, and we argue that further research is needed to explore the roles of sameness and substitutive views of the equal sign in supporting structural approaches to algebraic equation solving.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This book review of Humanizing Disability in Mathematics Education: Forging New Paths highlights the main contributions of a bold and unique book that dares shine a light on traditional dehumanizing mathematics education of disabled students. The review found the theoretical contributions offered by the authors to be an excellent foundation for mathematics educators and special education specialists to shift the paradigm in their classrooms to one where the mathematics of students with disabilities is at the focus. However, this review found the practical applications of these theories to be somewhat lacking.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we describe an experiment in using history to work on problem-solving and the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. The students involved attended the first year of the Italian upper secondary school (grade 9). The original sources we used are problems from Italian treatises on arithmetic and algebra that appeared in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. At the beginning, we present these treatises, which belong to a widespread mathematical tradition. We then describe the classroom experiment: we administered 14 problems from ancient treatises accompanied by the request to solve them and write impressions and comments. Data were collected through written protocols and interviews. The analysis of the results focused on the strategies implemented in solving the problems, with particular reference to the use of arithmetic and algebra, and on the perception of the cultural aspect introduced by these problems in the students’ approach to mathematics. The findings show the difficulties of some students on topics, such as fractions and direct proportionality, which should have been acquired in earlier school years. Combining the use of history with aspects of research in mathematics education allowed us to outline some teaching implications linked to the use of history.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This research investigates how a lesson study (LS) on designing and implementing challenging tasks impacts Vietnamese high school mathematics teacher knowledge and beliefs. Its contribution highlights cultural considerations when adopting LS to the forefront to contextualize the impacts. The results show that the teachers developed their specialized content knowledge by attending to students’ mathematics and creating cognitive conflicts building on student responses. The teachers changed their curriculum knowledge from implementer to transformer, improved knowledge about content and students attending to difficulties and misconceptions, and enhanced their knowledge about content and teaching in ways they designed, sequenced, and evaluated approaches that fit student learning. Finally, they changed their beliefs about mathematics to a comprehensive view of knowledge, mathematical proficiency, and sophisticated beliefs of teaching and learning. Discussion about the essence of LS when adopting it to different cultures is included.

  Abstract
      
                  <p>Thirty-seven third graders and thirty-two first graders engaged in solving a tangram puzzle in the shape of a fox. They had five minutes to solve the puzzle, and after this time, they received guidance on the particular piece they had difficulties with. Through the lenses of navigating flexible abstraction, reinterpretation, combinations, and borrowing structure to expand upon the existing 2D shape composition and decomposition learning trajectory, we examined ways in which students’ puzzle-solving processes and their challenges related to the fox puzzle’s features. Students’ initial shape placements suggest that parts of the fox puzzle primed the use of particular pieces, which reduced the abstraction of the puzzle. The most challenging part of the puzzle for students was navigating reinterpretation to place the square and two small triangles on the fox’s head in nonstandard orientations. Even though students faced challenges at different steps, they overcame them similarly by trying new combinations and by borrowing structure. Some students did not complete the puzzle even though they used flips and turns (reinterpretation) strategically. The results suggest potential modifications of the current learning trajectory to account for differences between tangram and pattern block puzzles and differences due to tangram puzzles’ features. Because the puzzle’s features played a role in students’ challenges, future work needs to focus on the interaction between students’ puzzle-solving processes and puzzles’ features for a variety of tangram puzzles.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruption to mathematics teacher education worldwide. This paper is anchored in our learnings from the experiences of teacher educators at four major universities from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they dealt with changes in their programs’ delivery triggered by the pandemic, and raises challenges that remain for the futures of post-pandemic mathematics teacher education. Here, we use the two ethical constructs of responsiveness and responsibility to guide actions in response to a crisis, in order to discuss a range of decisions the participants made to respond to the crisis. Behind their initial response to the emergent conditions, the participants were concerned about maintaining the continuity of their students’ education. Further, we identify remaining challenges for mathematics teacher educators to re-imagine their curriculum, teaching, assessment, and equitable access towards a more relevant, productive, and equitable mathematics teacher education. This study adds to the rapidly increasing literature on the effect of the pandemic on mathematics education in the following three ways: (1) here we take a comprehensive view of the disruptions instigated by the pandemic;, (2) we pay special attention to issues of equity; and (3) we address concerns about possible and desirable post-pandemic futures.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Informational text—resources whose purpose is to inform—is essential to daily life and fundamental to literacy. Unfortunately, young children typically have limited exposure to informational text. Two 9-week randomized controlled trials with 263 first-grade children from low-income communities examined whether free educational videos and digital games supported children’s ability to use informational text to answer real-world questions. Participants received Internet-enabled tablets and were randomly assigned to condition. Study 1 found significant positive intervention impacts on child outcomes; Study 2 replicated these findings. Combined analyses demonstrated primary impact on children’s ability to identify and use structural and graphical features of informational text. Results are discussed in the context of the scalability of educational media to support informational text learning.

  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to the lockdown of schools in many countries, forcing teachers and students to carry out educational activities remotely. In the case of mathematics, developing remote instruction based on both synchronous and asynchronous technological solutions has proven to be an extremely complex challenge. Specifically, this was the case in topics such as word problem solving, as this domain requires intensive supervision and feedback from the teacher. In this piece of research, we present an evaluation of how technology is employed in the teaching of mathematics, with particular relevance to learning during the pandemic. For that purpose, we conducted a systematic review, revealing the almost complete absence of experiments in which the use of technology is not mediated by the teacher. These results reflect a pessimistic vision within the field of mathematics education about the possibilities of learning when the student uses technology autonomously. Bringing good outcomes out of a bad situation, the pandemic crisis may represent a turning point from which to start directing the research gaze towards technological environments such as those mediated by artificial intelligence. As an example, we provide a study illustrating to what extent intelligent tutoring systems can be cost-effective compared to one-to-one human tutoring and mathematic learning-oriented solutions for intensive supervision in the teaching of word problem solving, especially appropriate for remote settings. Despite the potential of these technologies, the experience also showed that student socioeconomic level was a determining factor in the participation rate with an intelligent tutoring system, regardless of whether or not the administration guaranteed students' access to technological resources during the COVID-19 situation.</p>
