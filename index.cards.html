  Abstract
                  <p>Argu
      mentative problem solving in mathematics classrooms is a crucial practice that supports important student learning goals via collaborative deliberation and consensus building, but also places substantial cognitive and affective demands on both students and teacher. In this in-depth qualitative study, we considered how students’ emotions during argumentative discourse relate to their learning of real-life functional situations, an area of mathematics highlighted in the literature as foundational yet difficult. Observations, written reflections, and interviews of six Year 9 (14–15-year-old) students’ experience of argument construction, critique, and consensus building were analyzed for insights into emotions experienced during small-group argumentative problem solving, and how various emotions might support or hinder students’ mathematics learning. The emotion of frustration was experienced frequently and was found to facilitate persistence and the correction of misconceptions, but also to hinder the learning in contributing to ongoing tension and eventual resignation. Peer critique was found to stimulate negative emotions but positive learning processes, such as seeking other ways to explain one’s reasoning, and re-evaluating one’s own incorrect solutions.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As a Canadian mathematics educator, I have a vested interest in Canadian mathematics education matters. After all, to me, Canadian mathematics education matters. Knowing this little factoid, imagine my horror when it recently dawned on me that, no matter where I looked during this COVID-19 pandemic, all I saw was flippant treatment towards the metric system. As I detail in this article, COVID-19 social distancing signage, here in Canada, presents indifference towards the metric system. For shame, Canada. For shame. For the record, despite what nearly all the signs around us say at the moment, 2 m is not 6 ft. And, while I am at it, also for the record, 6 ft is not 2 m. Whether it is small business, big business or even the different levels of Canadian government (i.e., municipal, provincial or federal), it does not matter, the metric system is being poorly presented here at home during this global pandemic. The only good news, I am numb to it all now, which has helped me move on and start looking for other Canadian mathematics education matters. Stay tuned.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Volume 58, Issue 6, Page 1107-1141, December 2021. <br>This critical race ethnography examines a secondary-level dual-language (DL) program, a bilingual-education model thought to provide Latinxs educational equity. Drawing from a three-stage recursive analytic approach, I present evidence that a DL program’s policies and practices valued offering Latinx youth biliterate schooling only so long as DL was available and advantageous to Whites—which ultimately excluded some Latinx students from bilingual education and/or accessing its benefits. I theorize DL functions as white property when DL perpetuates racial hierarchies and preserves the value of a white racial identity, thereby maintaining Whites’ inequitable material accumulation. I problematize the logic of DL—highlighting that DL has the elitist tendencies of world-language education—and assess DL’s potential to deliver educational justice to Latinxs.

We analyzed these reflections at the sentence level (total 1,503 comments), both quantitatively and qualitatively, using a framework comprising descriptive, rationalistic, and anticipatory dimensions to understand the compositions of reflections generated from each type of prompt and the kinds of teacher abilities demonstrated in each dimension. We found quantitative patterns between prompt types and the reflections generated and emergent themes in each dimension of reflection relating to teacher abilities. We conclude by discussing three prompt design features that appeared to have played an important role in shaping the reflections and suggesting implications and future research directions.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Recent innovations in professional development are rife with a wide array of efforts focused on teacher collaboration. In this essay, we address some of the unexamined assumptions about the nature and significance of interactions in teacher professional collaboration, drawing on the concept of the “fourth wall” from theater and film studies. The fourth wall is a term used to describe the invisible wall that separates actors from their audience. We use this metaphor to interrogate the function of the fourth wall in professional learning and argue that it reflects a culture of professional learning that, despite innovations that tout teacher collaboration, upholds isolation in teaching and teacher learning and deep embedded norms of noninterference in one another’s practice. We also attend to the possibilities for supporting teacher learning that breaching the fourth wall affords when shared enactments of practice are used as a context for teachers’ sensemaking and collaboration.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this study, hypothetical samples of students’ work on a task involving pattern generalizations were used to examine the characteristics of the ways in which 154 elementary prospective teachers (PSTs) paid attention to students’ work in mathematics. The analysis included what the PSTs attended to, their interpretations, and their suggestions for supporting students’ further learning. While the findings showed that the PSTs noticed a wide range of aspects of mathematical learning, their analyses of students’ thinking and their ideas for supporting students’ learning lacked sophistication. Also, there was considerable divergence between the students’ thinking as evidenced in the hypothetical problem solutions and the PSTs’ suggested support. Based on these findings, we provide some suggestions for teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics teaching in a 21st-century educational context requires a shift to active learning. The shift calls on teachers, and the plans countries need to prepare to make the changes through well-designed teacher professional development programs. ARPA (Spanish acronym for Activating Problem Solving in Classrooms), as a professional development program, with an emphasis on collaborative problem solving, provides opportunities and tools for teachers to enrich their classroom activities in a student-centered manner. This study of 149 in-service teachers evaluates the impact of an ARPA workshop on teachers’ self-efficacy and their tendency to choose student-centered practices. The results show that before participating in the program, even if teachers had believed in their ability to solve problems, they did not consider how to connect this ability with the active student-centered problem-solving practices in their classroom. However, teachers’ self-efficacy in performing problem solving significantly affects the teachers’ report of their student-centered practices after participating in the program. Understanding the relationship between teacher confidence and the quality of their classroom activities is essential for the optimization of the outcomes of any teacher’s professional development.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Our research involves interacting with students and teachers through Teaching Experiments conducted in mathematics classes. The core scientific objectives of our work are to study the mathematical strategies used by students and the meaning they associate with the concepts at stake. Our interest in students’ comprehension of and approaches to their mathematics work requires that we continuously take into account the mathematics they produce in class so we can understand their methods and discover their underlying meanings. During a recent project carried out over the course of a school year, teachers from the primary and secondary classes that participated in the study spontaneously and repeatedly commented on the positive impact of our work on class dynamics: it created an environment that stimulated students’ mathematical work and fostered their sustained engagement. Although this was initially outside the scientific scope of our study, the significance and frequency of these comments from teachers caught our attention. This article describes the impact, or collateral outcomes, that our Teaching Experiments had on students and the classroom environment. Following a description of the scientific parameters guiding our research, we identify the scientific and epistemological foundations grounding our work. We then provide a detailed analysis of the collateral outcomes of our approach as expressed in the teachers’ statements. From this analysis emerges the theoretical concept of kindness, which offers a conceptualization of how our Teaching Experiments impact students, the classroom environment and the mathematics performed therein. Studying outcomes through the lens of kindness leads us to propose the notion of didactic kindness, as one that focuses on students’ progress in their mathematic abilities in class.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This critical qualitative study explores Hispanic-serving institutions’ (HSIs) pursuit of racialized federal funds and theorizes the connection between grant seeking and servingness at HSIs. Specifically, the study’s guiding research question was: Why do HSIs pursue racialized Title V funding? Based on interviews with 23 institutional actors at 12 HSIs, including public Hispanic-serving community colleges and both public and private 4-year institutions, the findings suggest that HSIs vie for Title V grants for assorted and, at times, conflicting reasons. Specifically, they seek this racialized funding to (a) pool money, (b) address broad-based institutional needs, (c) signal legitimacy, and (d) support all students. Importantly, some of the reasons have little to do with immediately serving students generally or Latinx students more specifically. Thus, I argue that in their race-evasive pursuit of Title V funds, many HSIs capitalize on their Latinx students, rendering serving into $erving and ghosting the “H” and “S” in HSIs.

  Abstract
                  <p>Prior studies have identified the impact beliefs have on mathematics instructors’ instructional practice, such as their choice to (or not to) lecture. However, the role of instructional context role in influencing beliefs and instruction has not been thoroughly researched. This paper explores how course context and beliefs could impact mathematics instructors’ propensity to lecture by investigating two very different instructional contexts in undergraduate mathematics in the United States: Calculus and Abstract Algebra. The results of our regression analyses were significant in both data sets and, we did find beliefs in each context that predicted the amount of time spent lecturing. For instance, the more calculus instructors believed in the effectiveness of teacher-centered instructional practices, the more likely they were to lecture. Whereas the more abstract algebra instructors believed in their student’s capacity to learn the less likely they were to lecture. However, while the regression model for the abstract algebra instructors accounted for 37.8% of the variability in the reported amount of time spent lecturing, the model for Calculus instructors only accounted for 2.7% of the variability. Thus our analyses indicate that there are contextual differences, such as course coordination, student demographics, and the job security of the instructors, that may be mitigating the extent to which beliefs impact instructional practice.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Participating in discussions of classroom video can support teachers to attend to student thinking. Central to the success of these discussions is how teachers interpret the activity they are engaged in—how teachers frame what they are doing. In asynchronous online environments, negotiating framing poses challenges, given that interactions are not in real time and often require written text. We present findings from an online course designed to support teachers to frame video discussions as making sense of student thinking. In an engineering pedagogy course designed to emphasize responsiveness to students’ thinking, we documented shifts in teachers’ framing, with teachers more frequently making sense of, rather than evaluating, student thinking later in the course. These findings show that it is possible to design an asynchronous online course to productively engage teachers in video discussions and inform theory development in online teacher education.

  Abstract
                  <p>The literature on proof by contradiction (PBC) is nearly unanimous in claiming that this proof technique is “more difficult” for students than direct proof, and offers multiple hypotheses as to why this might be the case. To examine this claim and to evaluate some of the hypotheses, we analyzed student work on proof construction problems from homework and examinations in a university “Introduction to Proof” course taught by one of the authors. We also conducted stimulated-recall interviews with student volunteers probing their thought processes while solving these problems, and their views about PBC in general. Our results suggest that the knowledge resources students bring to bear on proof problems, and how these resources are activated, explain more of their “difficulties” than does the logical structure of the proof technique, at least for this population of students.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The theoretical reflection on the nature of school algebra and the development of algebraic thinking from the first educational levels is a relevant topic in mathematics education. In this paper, we first summarize and clarify the positions held on this topic by two theoretical frameworks: the Theory of Objectification and the Onto-semiotic Approach. We identify concordances and complementarities in the respective conceptions of algebra and of the processes of developing algebraic thinking, as a result of applying these frameworks to analyse some students’ responses to a task on numerical patterns. We also analyse and compare the didactic models proposed in both theoretical frameworks for developing algebraic thinking. The analysis of the algebraic thinking and learning episodes is also used to illustrate a general discussion on the identity and boundaries of these theoretical frameworks and the possibilities of coordination and integration.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Teaching probability presents a number of challenges stemming from, among other things, its conceptual complexity and its impact on the development of probabilistic thinking. We conducted a study among primary and secondary teachers in Quebec (n = 626) where we asked them to describe the practices they use for teaching probability. We performed both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis on the results. The independent variables in the study were the level of education and the subject area of probability. The dependent variables were the participants’ self-reported levels of mathematical proficiency, instructional confidence, use of probabilistic approaches, and use of manipulatives in probability teaching. The results show variations according to the subject area of probability and the level of education being taught.</p>
