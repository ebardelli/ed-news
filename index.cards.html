  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This Policy Discourse Analysis (PDA) explores 19 state legislative documents focused on the teaching of disability history in K-12 schools. Framed through critical perspectives on constructions of disability and race, alongside discourse theory, we iteratively analyzed these legislative documents to understand (a) how disability and disability history are constructed (particularly in relation to whiteness); and (b) the stated purpose of the legislation and who is meant to benefit materially as a result of the laws. We find the legislation upholds dominant notions of whiteness and ability as part of school curriculum, while simultaneously constructing disability history as in the past and disability justice as already achieved, centering the learning and awareness of white, nondisabled students. We offer discussion and implications for research and practice surrounding policy implementation of teaching disability history.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 42-47, November 2022. <br> In education, we share a common commitment to supporting students’ growth and development, but we often have different ideas about what that support looks like. A theory of action describes how a specific education organization intends to work to create the outcomes it wants. Abby Javurek Andres and Chase Nordengren describe how to develop and enact a theory of action that meets the needs of the school community. The process involves bringing people together to gain understanding of the problem, learning what is going well and building a shared vision of success, and aligning communications and decision-making around the shared vision.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 24-28, November 2022. <br> Schools across the United States use abeyance agreements as an alternative to suspension or expulsion, yet little is known about them. These agreements allow students to avoid or reduce suspensions or expulsions, if they meet the terms of the agreement and waive certain due process rights. David Perrodin argues that these agreements enable school districts to circumvent requirements to report disciplinary data, a requirement intended to ensure schools’ disciplinary practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. These agreements appear to give students on the brink of suspension a second chance, but the terms are sometimes difficult to follow, and once the terms are broken, students may be subject to suspension without due process. They also bring disciplinary investigations to a quick close, sometimes without a clear understanding of the root causes of the misbehavior. And the lack of data about abeyance agreements means that authorities lose information that is useful in identifying potential safety threats or uncovering schools’ violations of students’ rights. Perrodin argues for the elimination of abeyance agreements for school discipline or for more standardized processes that can be tracked and that do not interfere with students’ rights.

However, using the current data, schools perceived as “good” tend to be in better-resourced districts and enroll higher percentages of wealthy and white students. Schools perceived as “bad” tend to be in more economically oppressed districts and enroll higher percentages of low-income students and students of color. James Noonan and Jack Schneider suggest more equitable collection of better and more nuanced data about schools can provide more complete pictures of strengths and weaknesses and could offer a way to spur investment in under resourced schools.

This analysis is inspired both by the “Series of problems at the crossroad of cultures” interdisciplinary history of sciences project, in which texts from various cultures structured around problems were analysed, and by ongoing mathematics educational research on the Hungarian Guided Discovery approach, where “series of problems” play a central role in the planning and implementation of teaching trajectories. I show how a dialog between the analysis of Clairaut’s historical text and mathematics educational research contributes to the reflection on the construction and analysis of inquiry based teaching trajectories in mathematics education.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Policies restricting bilingual education have yielded to policy frameworks touting its benefits. This shift corresponds with evolving lines of debate, focusing now on how bilingual education can best support racialized bilingual learners. One element of this new debate is the perspective on language underlying curriculum in bilingual programs, with a focus on translanguaging– normalization of the language practices of bilingual communities and positing that bilinguals draw from a singular linguistic repertoire. This article examines initiatives undertaken in California between 2010 and 2019 using Critical Policy Analysis. The work highlights that while opportunities for translanguaging have arisen, tensions between heteroglossic perspectives and the impulses toward standardization and commodification of language undermine such possibilities, and that notable gaps remain between teacher preparation frameworks and intended pedagogical practice.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Committing to a major is a fateful step in an undergraduate education, yet the relationship between courses taken early in an academic career and ultimate major issuance remains little studied at scale. Using transcript data capturing the academic careers of 26,892 undergraduates enrolled at a private university between 2000 and 2020, we describe enrollment histories by using natural-language methods and vector embeddings to forecast terminal major on the basis of course sequences beginning at college entry. We find that (a) a student’s very first enrolled course predicts their major 30 times better than random guessing and more than one-third better than majority-class voting, (b) modeling strategies substantially influence forecasting metrics, and (c) course portfolios vary substantially within majors, such that students with the same major exhibit relatively modest overlap.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 18-21, November 2022. <br> As more K-12 school districts have hired equity officers, questions have arisen about their role and effectiveness. A recent Heritage Foundation report, for example, found that schools with equity officers have the lowest achievement outcomes. Mary Rice-Boothe and Tanji Reed Marshall point out, however, that student achievement is not the only metric for determining the success of equity officers. When holding equity officers accountable, it’s important to be clear about the expectations for the role, establish appropriate measurements to assess their effectiveness, and provide supports that set the leaders up for success.

Teresa Preston summarizes the arguments made in the issue on “Reframing Accountability.” These include discussions of limitations of testing, the need for other accountability measures, the use of data to promote improvement, and the importance of capacity building in any accountability system.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 12-17, November 2022. <br> Results-based school accountability has been the linchpin of education reform in the United States for at least two decades. But the COVID-19 pandemic led many schools, states, and districts to put their testing and accountability programs on hold. Chester E. Finn, Jr., argues that it is time for the accountability holiday to end and makes recommendations for how to ensure the accountability programs are effective. Requirements for effective accountability include rigorous standards; assessments and other metrics; consequences for failing to meet, meeting, and exceeding standards; and the capacity to make changes needed to improve.
