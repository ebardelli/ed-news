  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Many prominent social scientists have advocated for random-draw lotteries as a solution to the “problem” of elite college admissions. They argue that lotteries will be fair, equitable, eliminate corruption, reduce student anxiety, restore democratic ideals, and end debates over race-conscious admissions. In response, we simulate potential lottery effects on student enrollment by race, gender, and income, using robust simulation methods and multiple minimum thresholds for grades and standardized tests. In the overwhelming majority of lottery simulations, the proportions of low-income students and students of color drop precipitously. With a GPA minimum, we find the proportion of men could drop as low as one third. Admissions lotteries with minimum bars for GPA and/or standardized tests do not appear to produce more equitable outcomes.

A recent 50-state scan shows that there is a great deal of variety in how these programs are designed and implemented, and data on the effectiveness of these programs to address teacher shortages is still emerging. Garcia discusses some specific programs that appear especially promising.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 22-27, November 2021. <br>The education model in which a single teacher instructs a single classroom of students has been remarkably persistent, but teacher shortages, low morale, and poor teacher retention are signs that it’s not working well for teachers. Ray Reutzel and Parker Fawson describe how Utah’s Center for the School of the Future is seeking to redesign the teacher workforce to improve outcomes for both teachers and students without increasing costs. Their integrated workforce model brings students together in a pod led by a master teacher, classroom teachers, teacher interns, aides, and tutors. Students receive more individualized support, and prospective teachers have more opportunities to practice their skills before receiving a license and becoming a lead teacher. The model also includes pathways for paraprofessionals to complete education coursework while they continue to earn an income.

The data also show that new teachers have become increasingly more likely, compared to experienced teachers, to work in schools with a greater fraction of students of color, which has consequences for equitable teacher assignments and teacher attrition.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 4-4, November 2021. <br>Long-standing teacher shortages have only gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, says Rafael Heller. As more teachers leave the profession, the teacher workforce is getting younger and greener. To stop the churn, school systems need to address the specific needs of their new teachers. Some are also beginning to pursue grow-your-own strategies that encourage current students, paraeducators, and other staff who are already invested in the community to become teachers.

His mission as the clock guy is not to mess up. That means he avoids doing anything fancy or learning what any of the buttons do beyond the ones he needs. When he worked as a long-term sub for a colleague’s paternity leave, it would have been easy for him to have the same attitude. By trying to create new materials, Goldman risked making mistakes — and eventually he did. As a teacher who was new to the school, this mistake had the potential to carry higher consequences that it would for a veteran, making the temptation to simply watch the clock even greater.

So far, there has been little research into the effects of the pandemic, but previous research shows that being away from school has more of an effect on students with learning disabilities. They also discuss how states are planning to use the funds made available under the American Recovery Plan and the challenge of balancing the need for flexibility to distribute funds quickly with the need to ensure that students’ needs are being met.

Controlling for demographics, teachers’ hours decreased early in the pandemic, but throughout the 2020–2021 school year teachers have been working more than usual. The increase is slightly more pronounced for veteran teachers and for females. The findings emphasize the increased demands of the teaching profession during the global pandemic.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 3, Page 68-68, November 2021. <br>Early childhood is a time when children begin building foundational skills of self-regulation and emotional competence. But, as Donna Housman explains, their teachers may not themselves have the training and support to help young students develop these abilities. She recommends that early childhood teachers receive professional development that helps them recognize and manage their own emotions, stress, and anxieties so they can better foster self-regulation among their students.

Most of the remaining states have decided to allow school districts to do whatever they want around masks, but a few banned local mask mandates. These developments invite a number of legal questions about the legality of mask mandates (and bans on those mandates). Robert Kim reviews the legal decisions issued thus far related to mask requirements.

In this monthly column, Teresa Preston explores what authors have said about the personal qualities and training that teachers need. Common threads include a recognition that intelligence does not necessarily equate to teaching success and concern that alternate pathways were bringing unqualified teachers into classrooms.

Obi-Wan shows that there’s value in stepping away from the action to become a voice in the head of those on the front line, that it’s important to recognize that others may be better mentors, and that a time will come when others must take the lead.

Yet schools are challenged by the limits in the curriculum and the difficulty of addressing the different types of prior knowledge that students bring to the classroom. Lee suggests that when schools build their content and pedagogy on current understandings of human learning, they will be better able to enable students from all backgrounds to practice building the understandings they need, now and in the future.

Paul Bruno and Dan Goldhaber describe the waivers that states requested and received, what they suggest about how state test results might be used for different purposes and by different people, and what uses of testing seem to be most salient to policy makers. They conclude with recommendations for policy makers about how to design testing policy that can both improve educational outcomes and maintain robust political support, objectives achieved at best imperfectly by existing testing policy.

Unfortunately, as Dan Goldhaber and Kris Holden explain, the two national data collections that can be used to explore these areas provide incomplete and sometimes contrasting pictures about the number of people preparing for a teaching career. They describe how data collection could be improved to address this problem and provide a clearer national picture of who is preparing to be tomorrow’s teachers.

David Steiner explains some of the reasons that reading research is a low priority for educators on the front lines and offers some guidance for determining whether research results are meaningful without an extensive background in statistics. Ideally, education decision makers should look for randomized control trials with high effect sizes and low p-values.
