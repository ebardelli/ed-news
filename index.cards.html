  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>While there has been an increase in action research explicitly defined as feminist in orientation, there has not been sufficient discussion on the actual translation of feminist theory into research practices. The aim of this article is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge labelled Feminist Participatory Action Research (FPAR) by articulating specific research practices for conducting research with young women who are negotiating social injustice and marginalization. We define and describe four research practices: 1. coalescing into a group; 2. encouraging the shared ownership of the research process and its outcomes; 3. developing multiple centres of power; and 4. promoting interdependency. We illustrate these principles with specific examples from an FPAR study that explored how social workers in Israel can best support girls and young women in situations of distress. We explored this question with a group of young women who were active partners in the research process. We conclude the article by underscoring the linkage between these four practices and feminist theory.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Colleges have increasingly turned to predictive analytics to target at-risk students for additional support. Most of the predictive analytic applications in higher education are proprietary, with private companies offering little transparency about their underlying models. We address this lack of transparency by systematically comparing two important dimensions: (1) different approaches to sample and variable construction and how these affect model accuracy and (2) how the selection of predictive modeling approaches, ranging from methods many institutional researchers would be familiar with to more complex machine learning methods, affects model performance and the stability of predicted scores. The relative ranking of students’ predicted probability of completing college varies substantially across modeling approaches. While we observe substantial gains in performance from models trained on a sample structured to represent the typical enrollment spells of students and with a robust set of predictors, we observe similar performance between the simplest and the most complex models.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Teachers of color increase school success for students of color. Yet, little attention has been paid to whether school attendance behaviors also increase from same race and ethnicity matches. To address this, our study used administrative data provided by a California high school district for the school years 2014 to 2018. We explored student absenteeism at the date and class period levels. Using this rich, longitudinal data set, we employed grade, school, class period, student, and date fixed effects models to examine the association between student–teacher matches and student absenteeism. Student–teacher race and ethnicity matches were associated with fewer unexcused absences for Latinx students. The results also indicate that associations were strongest for Latinx students in 11th and 12th grades—the age group in K–12 that has the most individual agency when it comes to getting to school. Furthermore, we found no evidence of declines in excused absences, which reflect health.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Broadly understood, values represent orientation guidelines for daily action, thinking, and feeling. Thus, they affect teachers’ everyday work and are among their professional competencies. While general values and some single profession-specific values of teachers (e.g., responsibility) have already been investigated empirically, the current study aims to cover a broader range of profession-specific values by developing and validating the Tübingen Inventory to Measure Teachers’ Profession-Specific Value Orientations (TIVO), based on three independent studies with pre-service (Studies 1 and 2; N1 = 334, N2 = 239) and in-service teachers (N3 = 308). The results demonstrate that the TIVO is appropriate to assess four profession-specific values in a second-order model: caring, justice, responsibility, and truthfulness as first-order factors, with fairness as a second-order factor loading on the latter three first-order factors. The results from preregistered experiments and confirmatory factor analysis provide consistent evidence for the construct validity of the TIVO.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>‘DIY’ publications called zines have long been a way for marginalized communities to record their stories, spread information and organize. However, this article presents zines as a potential research tool for action researchers who are working within organisational contexts. The authors, both museum professionals, action researchers and zinesters, use examples from their research within art museums to examine the value of zines as a methodology. Though the research projects take place within art organisations, using the four themes of aesthetics, communities of practice, counter-narratives and plurality it considers how zines could be used more broadly as a research tool in other knowledge-based settings. The authors provide a recommendation for practitioners to explore zining to engender dialogic cultures in their organisations as well as their potential in shaping ‘major’ and ‘minor’ organisational change.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Early evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic sharply reduced public school enrollment in many states. However, little is known about the underlying patterns of these declines. Using new district-level data from Massachusetts, we find that these declines were concentrated in traditional districts while charter, virtual, and vocational districts increased their enrollment. Though the enrollment declines in traditional districts were widespread, we also find that the percent declines were significantly larger in smaller districts and those serving higher concentrations of White and economically disadvantaged students. The implications for understanding the pandemic’s effects on learning opportunities and the anticipated fiscal stress on public schools are discussed.

  Evaluation Review, Volume 45, Issue 1-2, Page 70-104, February-April 2021. <br>Background: In randomized controlled trials, attrition rates often differ by treatment status, jeopardizing causal inference. Inverse probability weighting methods and estimation of treatment effect bounds have been used to adjust for this bias. Objectives: We compare the performance of various methods within two samples, both generated through lottery-based randomization: one with considerable differential attrition and an augmented dataset with less problematic attrition. Research Design: We assess the performance of various correction methods within the dataset with problematic attrition. In addition, we conduct simulation analyses. Results: Within the more problematic dataset, we find the correction methods often performed poorly. Simulation analyses indicate that deviations from the underlying assumptions for bounding approaches damage the performance of estimated bounds. Conclusions: We recommend the verification of the underlying assumptions in attrition correction methods whenever possible and, when verification is not possible, using these methods with caution.

  Abstract
                  <p>The goal of this study is to identify the multiple ways in which instructors take advantage of a feature designed into university textbooks that seeks to invite students to get acquainted with the content prior to attending the class in which such content will be discussed. We present an analysis of teacher instrumentation of this feature, which we call questioning devices, using data from 15 instructors who taught calculus, linear algebra, or abstract algebra over one semester. The instructors taught at 14 different universities in the United States. We identified four utilization schemes of the questioning devices in which instructors: completed questioning devices for pre-planning, required students to complete the questioning devices for the purpose of lesson planning, used the questioning devices for the purpose of instruction, and required students complete the questioning devices for the purpose of assessment. These schemes are supported by various operational invariants related to self-perception as competent instructors and implicit theories of teaching and learning. The identified utilization schemes inform textbook developers and author-designers, making them aware of whether these features fulfill their design purposes, and possibly think about changes that might be needed to support instructors in achieving their instructional goals and improve learning. We suggest some further areas of inquiry.</p>
