  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Students’ self-determined motivation (acting out of interest, curiosity, and abiding values) is associated with higher academic well-being, persistence, and achievement. Self-determination theory posits that self-determined motivation is dependent on the satisfaction of three psychological needs (relatedness, competence, and autonomy), which are in turn facilitated through need-supportive behaviors from notable others. In this meta-analysis, conducted over 144 studies and more than 79,000 students, we sought to overview pathways to student motivation in order to verify (1) how do psychological needs rank in the strength of their prediction of self-determined motivation and (2) which autonomy-support providers (parents or teachers) are the most relevant for psychological need satisfaction in students and self-determined motivation. Results show that teacher autonomy support predicts students’ need satisfaction and self-determined motivation more strongly than parental autonomy support. In addition, competence is the most positive predictor of self-determined motivation, followed by autonomy and then by relatedness.

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examined elementary and secondary prospective teachers’ (PTs’) abilities to analyze a classroom lesson in order to make claims about student thinking around specific mathematical learning goals based on relevant and revealing evidence. Previous research suggests PTs have some skills in analyzing evidence but apply them inconsistently. Our goal was to describe in more detail the strengths and weaknesses in PTs’ ability to analyze evidence of student thinking. Results indicate that PTs can make some appropriate claims about student learning in a lesson transcript, but more often make overly broad and general claims. PTs were able to support their claims with specific student work but often used poorly aligned evidence. PTs also often explicitly recognized the shortcomings of evidence from the lesson transcript, but then relied on that evidence to make claims about student thinking. Finally, PTs’ background, such as number of teacher education courses completed, does not appear to strongly influence their ability to make claims and support them with evidence, though secondary PTs were more likely to recognize the limitations of evidence than elementary PTs. These results have implications for teacher educators, pointing to the importance of designing interventions to help PTs look beyond the most visible and salient features of a lesson when analyzing student thinking.

  Abstract
                    <p>Lesson study has been implemented in schools around the world as a method of professional development for teachers. Lesson study consists of five steps, among which the “Research Lesson” and “Post-lesson Discussion” are central. During the Post-lesson Discussion, after the teacher has commented on the lesson, all of the observers discuss the lesson, and the “knowledgeable other” (koshi), a specially invited expert, provides final comments. The quality of these final comments is critical to the learning of the lesson-study participants, and, consequently, the koshi plays an extremely important role. However, few studies have examined the nature and structure of the final comments that koshis provide. This study analyzed the final comments made in three elementary-school research lessons in Japan by a highly distinguished university mathematics educator with considerable teaching experience and an outstanding reputation as a koshi. We found that his final comments clustered into seven categories, which we named: (1) considering the didactical value of mathematical content; (2) use of representations; (3) fostering positive attitudes to learning; (4) incorporating students’ ideas into whole-class discussions; (5) giving attention to what students write down; (6) giving attention to the content of the board-work; and (7) teacher growth through reflection. These categories provide insight into the nature of final comments that are regarded as being particularly useful and may form the basis for less-experienced koshis to structure their final comments in lesson study.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>As university instructors update modes of teaching and student engagement in STEM classes, concerns often arise about student resistance to different methods of teaching and learning. This research examines what it looks like from a student perspective to experience a shift in attitude by exploring the case of Dane, a white male student who changed his perspective from opposition to support of group exams in calculus. Part of this shift included a change in Dane’s view of his relation to others, as he began to see how working with others benefited himself, consider others’ experiences, and recognize how group exams can be helpful to everyone. We consider how Dane’s experience and attitudes are likely influenced by the racialized and gendered nature of mathematics, and we explore factors of Dane’s calculus classes that contributed to his shift in beliefs. Dane’s story raises questions about instructors’ role in not only working to garner student support for new teaching and learning practices, but interrogating deeper beliefs about what it means to do mathematics and the role of others in students’ mathematics engagement. This research also highlights the importance of exploring students’ experiences and attitudes in relation to the larger sociopolitical context of mathematics.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Commonly regulated structural quality features, like educator education levels and group size, are thought to be foundational to the quality of children’s everyday experiences in early education and care settings. Yet little is known about how these features relate to the day-to-day interactions and activities that occur in these settings—or process quality features—across the landscape of early education and care. In this study, we examine the association between structural quality features and process quality features in a diverse sample of classrooms (n = 672) participating in a statewide study of early education and care. Using a permutation test approach, we found that group size and child-to-adult ratio were most consistently linked to children’s experiences but educator education, experience, and curriculum usage were largely unrelated. Implications of these findings for quality improvement initiatives are discussed.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>In this thought experiment, we explore how to make access to individualized instruction and academic mentoring more equitable by taking tutoring to scale as a permanent feature of the U.S. public education system. We first synthesize the tutoring and mentoring literature and characterize the landscape of existing tutoring programs. We then outline a blueprint for integrating federally funded and locally delivered tutoring into the school day. High school students would serve as tutors/mentors in elementary schools via an elective class, college students in middle schools via federal work-study, and 2- and 4-year college graduates in high schools via AmeriCorps. We envision an incremental, demand-driven expansion process with priority given to high-needs schools. Our blueprint highlights a range of design tradeoffs, implementation challenges, and program costs. We estimate that targeted approaches to scaling school-wide tutoring nationally, such as focusing on K–8 Title I schools, would cost between $5 and $16 billion annually.

  Abstract
                  <p>The study explored the verb clauses and thematic development evident in curriculum materials and in transcripts of teachers planning lessons using the materials. A central argument is that though teacher characteristics influence the ways they plan lessons with curriculum materials, the materials themselves influence teachers’ planned lessons via the ways mathematics is construed in the materials. We used verb clause and thematic analysis to analyze the features of curriculum materials and teachers’ lesson planning using those materials. We found differences between the curriculum materials in terms of how they construed mathematical activity and found that teachers’ lesson plans roughly aligned with the features in the materials; this speaks to the impact of features of curriculum materials on teachers’ lesson planning. We also found small but perceptible differences between teachers from different curriculum backgrounds, suggesting an enculturating effect from the materials.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Within a global context of more standardization of teacher preparation, programs in the USA are increasingly using standardized teacher performance assessments such as edTPA to evaluate prospective teachers’ instructional effectiveness and readiness for their own classroom. This study was conducted in a state recently requiring successful completion of edTPA for initial teacher certification. Phenomenological methodology was used to examine the lived experiences of six elementary prospective teachers completing Elementary Education edTPA: Assessing Students’ Mathematics Learning (i.e., Math Task 4) during student teaching. Data were collected via 24 individual, phenomenological interviews at specific phases during the student teaching semester. Whole-Part-Whole analysis revealed the prospective teachers found themselves in a state of elusiveness as they engaged in Math Task 4. Three themes provide the structure for elusiveness, including juggling Math Task 4 in student teaching classrooms, from relying on experts to standing alone, and navigating edTPA processes. Understanding prospective teachers’ lived experiences with Math Task 4 provides insights into both needed supports for their successful completion of the task and some of the issues with a high stakes teacher performance assessment embedded in the student teaching semester.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Given the scarcity of studies explicitly exploring the often tacit assumption that teachers’ content knowledge (CK) is pre-requisite of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), in this study, we draw on Shulman’s conceptualization of these notions to examine their relation by content-aligning the CK and PCK measures. Toward this end, we analyzed data from a paper-and-pencil survey gauging primary schoolteachers’ CK and PCK on fractions. The data of 373 completed teacher surveys were analyzed using two different complementary approaches, with the one compensating for the limitations of the other: item response theory analysis and statistical implicative analysis. Both analyses suggested that CK could be considered pre-requisite of PCK: when the CK and PCK items were placed on the same item response theory scale in most of the CK–PCK pairs, the PCK items were more difficult than their aligned CK items; additionally, in most of the quasi-implication paths of the statistical implicative analysis, answering the CK items was found to be pre-requisite of answering their aligned PCK items. We discuss the study findings, considering their theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Designers in out-of-school spaces often negotiate the meaning of mathematics as part of the design process, determining what to include in classes and exhibits both implicitly and explicitly. This analysis suggests that instead of keeping these conversations behind the scenes, we should foreground them for participants. In doing so, we may actually be helping to expand their sense of what counts as mathematics as they participate in legitimate communal activity. The focal analysis examines the case of one participant in a knitting summer camp as she encounters the mathematics that the facilitator deemed necessary to move the knitting project forward. Together they negotiate whether their work counts as knitting or as mathematics, and what the consequences for that designation are for how they make sense of the activity. I argue that this kind of encounter has the potential to build bridges between everyday and school mathematics and thus to broaden participation.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Due to structural inequity, White students, those whose parents attained a university degree, and those from upper/middle class households are more likely to attain a doctoral degree. One federal program, the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, provides undergraduates with academic and financial support to help marginalized students enroll and succeed in graduate school. However, little research has examined how this program has helped students attain the ultimate goal of a PhD. In this explanatory, embedded case study, 12 participants described how the program provided financial, academic, and social supports from peers, faculty, and staff during their doctoral programs.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Drawing on the global interdisciplinary literature on decolonizing curriculum and pedagogy (DCP) in higher education, we critically examined the idea of decolonizing in the context of disciplines and universities around the world. Based on a critical analysis of 207 articles and book chapters published in English and centering a geopolitics of knowledge frame, we present three themes: (a) decolonizing meaning(s), (b) actualizing decolonization, and (c) challenges to actualizing, all related to DCP. We observed three major meanings of decolonization and four ways to actualize DCP that were associated with geographical, disciplinary, institutional, and/or stakeholder contexts. We argue that while there are similarities within the literature, ultimately the meanings, actualizations, and challenges of DCP are contextual, which has political and epistemological consequences. We end by offering directions for education research on DCP, revealing the possibility for a field or discipline of decolonial studies.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>The literature on science discourse in K–12 classrooms in the United States has proliferated over the past couple of decades, crossing geographical, disciplinary, theoretical, and methodological boundaries. There is general consensus that science talk is at the core of students’ learning; however, a synthesis of key findings from the expansive literature base is needed. This systematic literature review is guided by a complex systems framework to organize and synthesize empirical studies of science talk in urban classrooms across individual (student or teacher), collective (interpersonal), and contextual (sociocultural, historical) planes. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary approaches that integrate theories and methodologies to account for the complex phenomena of science discourse, including interacting elements across levels as well as stable and changing patterns that influence students’ access to, and nature of, science talk in urban classrooms. Unresolved questions related to high-leverage, equitable, and sustainable discourse practices; future lines of inquiry that can benefit by drawing from diverse theoretical traditions and mixed methodological approaches; and practical implications for classroom-based strategies to support science discourse are also discussed.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>One of the traditional aims of higher education is to prepare informed citizens who are civically engaged. Although many voters are underinformed, there are multiple social benefits to having an informed electorate. Therefore, colleges should aspire to not only increase student voter turnout but to prepare informed voters. In this article, I use matching procedures to account for precollege civic engagement and estimate treatment effects of taking at least one community college course. I find that taking political science influences college student voter registration, voter turnout, and ability to correctly answer questions about the roles of U.S. political institutions.

  Abstract
                  <p>The present study examines the structure and mathematical content of children’s mathematical arguments as part of communication in play-based activities. It shows how Nordin and Boistrup’s (The Journal of Mathematical Behavior 51:15–27, 2018) framework for identifying and reconstructing mathematical arguments, which includes Toulmin’s model of argumentation, the notion of anchoring (Lithner, Educational Studies in Mathematics 67:255–276, 2008) and a multimodal approach, can be used to identify and explore preschool children’s mathematical arguments. Two different types of argument that occurred during play-based activities were identified: partial arguments and full arguments. The findings reveal the extensive use of multimodal interactions in all parts of the children’s mathematical arguments. Moreover, the findings point to the crucial role of adults as dialogue collaborators in the argumentation that emerges in the play-based activities.</p>

However, because there is no achievement-level description for below Basic, educators and policymakers lack information on the nature of the reading difficulties that these students face. To help fill this gap, we analyze data from the 2018 NAEP Oral Reading Fluency study. We find that, compared with students who perform at the NAEP Basic level and above, students who perform below NAEP Basic level are much more likely to have poor oral reading fluency and word reading skills.

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical creativity is considered beneficial for learning mathematics. However, research studies that provide empirical evidence of students’ mathematical creativity in regular mathematics classrooms are relatively scarce. This study explores the idea of mini-creativity (mini-c), which is defined as the creative processes involved in the construction of personal knowledge and understanding. The aim of the study is the identification and characterization of mini-c instances when students are first introduced to the arithmetic mean concept. In total, 97 Grade 6 students participated in a technologically enhanced instructional program which was developed according to the principles of the theoretical framework ‘personalised mathematics and mathematics inquiry’ (PMMI). The analysis of the results suggests that the learning environment supported the development of mini-c. From students’ worksheets and classroom observations, three categories of mini-c instances were identified and characterized, as follows: (a) building insight and abstractness of a mathematical concept; (b) creating, manipulating, and connecting representations; and (c) expressing flexible thinking.</p>
