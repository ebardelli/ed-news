  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>This paper studies the patterns of individuals’ student loan repayment for up to 12 years, tracking borrowers through the formative ages of the early 20s to the late 30s. Using social sequence and cluster analysis to understand these longitudinal repayment histories, we identify five archetypes of loan repayment that describe borrowers’ experiences: persistent defaulters, perpetual payers, rapid full payers, late full payers, and consolidators. We find significant stratification by race/ethnicity, social class, and institutional sector into repayment clusters, with minoritized borrowers and those attending for-profit institutions more likely to experience adverse borrowing outcomes and to experience them for longer.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>To understand how parents adapted to virtual learning expectations during the initial COVID-19 school closures in spring 2020, this study investigated families’ daily activities, including parents’ emotions and their appraisals of the value of daily activities across two timepoints. Thirty-two parent–child dyads (Mean child age = 78 months, 50% male; 47% Latinx/Hispanic; 28% Spanish speaking) from a Southern California school district serving a diverse population completed a daily diary texting protocol (experience sampling method; ESM) five times per day over five days. Families spent most of their time together engaging in mealtime activities (preparing meals and eating). Families from low socioeconomic backgrounds reported appraising academic activities, social skills, and life skills more highly than families from high socioeconomic backgrounds. Parents reported more positive emotions than negative emotions. Findings provide opportunities for educators to mitigate learning loss by building on children’s learning experiences and family adaptations to daily routines during COVID-19.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Preservice teachers will one day be responsible for addressing bullying among their students but their readiness to fulfill this critical role is unknown. This article addressed this line of inquiry by conducting a systematic review assessing preservice teachers’ knowledge, attitudes, sense of responsibility, and confidence to deal with bullying. A total of 42 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Results suggest that few preservice teachers understand the hallmarks of bullying. In terms of their attitudes toward bullying, most preservice teachers report they are concerned about bullying, but some still believe it to be a normal part of growing up. Preservice teachers tended to view different forms of bullying as more serious than others, with many considering physical bullying to be the most serious form. Most preservice teachers report feeling responsible for dealing with bullying, yet many do not feel confident in their ability to do so. Implications for future research on preservice teachers, teacher preparation programs, and future efforts to reduce bullying in schools are discussed.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The realities of a global pandemic coupled with economic, climate, and racial crises have exacerbated existing racial injustices in schools and society. Although many have argued for a principled refusal to return to an inequitable “normal” (Roy, 2020), dominant models of educational improvement prioritize technical-rational approaches that often result in administrative racism in school systems, with little attention to the complexities of race, power, and privilege in addressing long-standing racial injustices. The need to address settler colonialism, anti-Black, and other intersectional racisms are far from new, but we argue that the confluence of these pandemics demands new roles for research-practice partnerships (RPPs) in education that aspire to transform systems beyond their current construction. In this article, we draw on the intersections between racial equity and RPP scholarship to propose key pivots for RPPs in working to foster educational justice in school systems. We use our racial equity-focused RPP to illustrate efforts to (a) center justice in multidimensional change; (b) develop equity-centered data systems; and (c) enlist racially minoritized youth, family, and community expertise. As partners in an ongoing racial equity-focused RPP, we challenge ourselves and our colleagues to take up the work of remaking schooling to become answerable to the learning and knowledge of youth, families, and communities impacted by racial and educational injustices.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Evaluation influence is a reconceptualization of evaluation use that reflects the broad and diffuse impacts an evaluation can have on social programs and policies. This way of thinking about impact provides an opportunity to investigate how and why evaluations influence social programs and policy. Twenty participants (practitioners and managers) from two child protection programs evaluated in the previous 24 months were interviewed about the influence of these evaluations, which was complemented with the collection of internal documents about changes to the programs. A qualitative case study analysis of evaluation influence was conducted using the interviews and documents to investigate the influence of two evaluations at different stages in the dissemination process. The participants identified that the evaluations appeared to have significant high-level policy level influence; however, limited examples of influence on practices in the programs were identified. There was some suggestion that the evaluations had increased practitioner interest in working with and participating in program evaluations. The findings suggest the importance of developmental evaluation approaches and practitioner engagement in evaluation to improve the influence and adoption of new knowledge from the evaluation of social programs.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Conceptualizations of servingness must include an understanding of how racial ideologies shape Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Three Latinx scholars offer testimonios on our experiences as students, faculty, and researchers at teaching and research-intensive HSIs. From our testimonios, we found that practices of Blanqueamiento (Whitening of a population) and Mestizaje (racial mixture) operate at HSIs to flatten our understanding of Hispanics in U.S. society. To make sense of our testimonios within these HSI contexts and constraints, we applied an intersectional consciousness perspective on racialized organizations. Findings include Whiteness operating as a credential, legitimizing unequal resources, diminishing agency among minoritized groups, and continued use of Mestizaje (disguised as Hispanic) as a prevailing ideology. We provide considerations for HSI leaders, researchers, and administrators to elevate their intersectional consciousness and disrupt how HSIs contribute to essentialist notions of Latinxs.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This article examines how leaders in public, private, and hybrid educational systems manage competing pressures in their institutional environments. Across all systems, leaders responded to system-specific puzzles by (re)building systemwide educational infrastructures to support instructional coherence and framed these efforts as rooted in concerns about pragmatic organizational legitimacy. These efforts surfaced several challenges related to educational equity; leaders framed their responses to these challenges as tied to both pragmatic and moral organizational legitimacy. To address these challenges, leaders turned to an array of disparate government and nongovernment organizations in their institutional environments to procure and coordinate essential resources. Thus, the press for instructional coherence reinforced their reliance on an incoherent institutional environment.

  Abstract
                  <p>It is commonly known that the letter M in the two acronyms HPM and STEM stands for mathematics, and it is natural to regard mathematics as playing a significant role in science education. However, it seems that appropriate attention is not usually accorded to the role of M in the area of STEM where mathematics tends to be marginalized. In fact, throughout history one witnesses STEM at work so that the discussion of HPM and STEM in parallel will be beneficial to both. In both the historical and pedagogical aspects, it may be worthwhile to note that history of mathematics affords some means to mirror several different mathematical worlds in the context of HPM in a pluralistic way in order to offer a fuller view of the subject. In this paper I examine this issue through sampling many examples gleaned from the history of mathematics, particularly the role of M in the world of science and technology.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Lesson study is a Japanese concept to improve teaching and learning mathematics through a particular form of activity in which a group of teachers works collaboratively to plan, implement, observe, and reflect on the proposed research lessons. Although lesson study is internationally acknowledged as providing key learning opportunities for teachers, there is limited information on post-lesson discussion and its contribution toward teachers’ professional growth. This study has the aim of describing the key features of post-lesson discussions. An entire group of teachers at a public elementary school in Japan participated in three lesson study cycles. During the post-lesson discussion in each cycle, the teachers were invited to write down what they believed was significant in the planned lesson and their comments regarding the lessons, for the discussion. The writings and comments were collected and analyzed. This method helped capture teachers’ ‘voices’ better compared to recordings of oral discussion. The results of the analyses of teachers’ writings and comments revealed that a major part of post-lesson discussions involved issues related to pedagogies, and teachers’ reflections tended to focus more on students’ thinking and mathematical topics over time as the cycles of lesson study proceeded. The results suggested that teachers’ professional growth can be related to their recognition of the importance of understanding students’ thinking and their perspectives on mathematics, in order to improve teaching.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Black queer undergraduates experience invisibility at the juncture of anti-Black racism and cisheteropatriarchy in their campus environments. With the absence of research on queer students of color in undergraduate STEM, it has been unexplored how Black queer invisibility is reinforced and disrupted in uniquely racialized and cisheteronormative STEM spaces. Drawing on Black queer studies and a proposed framework of STEM education as a White, cisheteropatriarchal space, our study addresses this research gap by exploring four Black queer students’ experiences of oppression and agency in navigating invisibility as STEM majors. A counter-storytelling analysis reveals how curricular erasure and within-group peer tensions shaped variation in undergraduate Black queer students’ STEM experiences of invisibility. Findings inform implications for education research, practice, and policy.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Research has consistently demonstrated that learners are strikingly poor at metacognitively monitoring their learning and comprehension of texts. The aim of the present meta-analysis is to explore three important questions about metacomprehension: (a) To what extent can people accurately discriminate well-learned texts from less well learned ones? (b) What are the (meta)cognitive causes of poor metacomprehension accuracy? and (c) What interventions improve the accuracy of metacomprehension judgments? In total, the meta-analysis integrated 502 effects and data from 15,889 participants across 115 studies to assess these questions. The results showed a weighted mean correlation of .178 for nonintervention effects. Many interventions were shown to be effective, such as delayed summary writing and delayed keyword generation. In addition, combining different interventions tended to generate additive benefits. The findings support the transfer-appropriate monitoring account, the situation model framework, and the poor-comprehension theory as explanations for why metacomprehension accuracy is typically poor. Practical implications are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>Habermas’ construct of rationality is a tool adaptated from social sciences into mathematics education to identify the difficulties in the proving process and to plan the teaching of proof for reducing these difficulties. According to Habermas, people engaged in an activity/action are considered to “act rationally” if they choose and use the available criteria and communication tools in the field to reach their aim. Habermas’ construct is composed of three integrated components which are epistemic, teleological, and communicative rationality, and in this study, the proving process of university students was analyzed based on this construct. The aim was to identify the performance of students in the context of rationality components and explore the reasons for the difficulties students experience during the proving process. Freshmen mathematics teacher candidates participated in the study and the researchers focused on the field of geometry. The findings revealed that different interactions between the rationality components considerably affected the proving process of students. On the other hand, during the analysis, the modeling requirements of the epistemic rationality and communicative rationality components needed to be structured with new sub-components. It is thought that this expanded version of Habermas’ construct of rationality can be used more effectively to identify the difficulties students have in mathematical activities such as problem solving, proving, and modeling.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it a new way of being in a changed and uncertain world. Aotearoa/New Zealand took a well-being approach and in turn, we share the positive outcomes which resulted for some low socio-economic schools and communities in relation to teacher learning and relationships with families. In this article, we report on how teachers and schools connected with diverse students and their families during the period of remote learning. We draw on the responses from 20 teachers and school leaders who participated in interviews. Following the wider government focus, schools took a well-being first approach which led to increased connections and positive home/school relationships. The results highlight how a disruptive event such as COVID-19 can also be a time to focus on strengths of diverse communities and gain insights. We demonstrate that while focusing on mathematics, teachers and school leaders gained insights related to their students’ funds of knowledge and saw opportunities for learning for students, parents, and the teachers themselves.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In the last two decades, studying the possible relations between the history of mathematics and mathematics education has revealed the importance of certain foundational issues concerning the nature, relevance and validity of historical knowledge vis-à-vis problems of teaching and learning, which call for deeper exploration. Reviewing aspects of the corresponding debate points to the complementary character of many concepts (often considered as irreconcilable or antagonistic), the necessity of an appropriate didactical transposition of historical knowledge, and the need for new historical research motivated by didactical questions that contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of historical issues that are still discussed. We aim to contribute along these lines by considering as a case study what has been interpreted by many historians as an ‘embarrassing mistake’ of Euler in his Vollständige Anleitungzur Algebra. Based on a well-known didactical problem in elementary arithmetic and algebra on the use of the equality notion and symbol, we argue against this interpretation. This in turn illustrates how didactical and historical research can benefit from each other and points to the need for a didactical transposition of historical knowledge, to be seen as complementary to scholarly historical knowledge rather than as a rival distortion of it.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Major host countries of international students such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US have introduced post-study work rights as a strategic policy to both enhance their destination attraction and support international students’ post-graduation work experiences. While this policy is generally welcomed by both host institutions and international students, little is known about the support mechanism for the growing cohort of international student graduates who stay in their countries of study on temporary graduate visas, especially in relation to major concerns such as post-graduation work, visa application, and migration pathways. This article fills this gap in the existing literature. It is derived from a study that includes 50 interviews with university staff, agents, and international graduates. It uses positioning theory as a conceptual framework. The article assesses the role of universities in supporting their international alumni on temporary visas. The findings of the study raise concerns about the scope of university advice. It reports loopholes which legitimize the practices of migration agents to the conditions that enable them to exercise their exclusive rights in providing work-migration nexus advice to international students and graduates, making this cohort vulnerable to exploitation of unethical agents. The study provides the evidence base to develop recommendations for related stakeholders in improving the post-graduation experiences of international student graduates who remain in the host countries on temporary visas.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>When did sociologist Orlando Fals-Borda name his method Participatory Action Research (PAR), and what were the epistemological implications of this shift from action research to PAR? To address these questions, this article critically examines Fals-Borda’s ‘participatory turn’ —his epistemological shift from orthodox Marxism to the participatory paradigm—, which squarely underpinned the origins of PAR yet has hitherto remained unexplored in the literature. The article focuses on Fals-Borda’s transition from participation “by” to participation “with” the people, which occurred during a period of intense self-criticism after years of radical activism. Drawing on exhaustive archival research, it examines the collaborative systematisation of his method alongside an emerging constellation of participatory research practices. Thereby, it highlights the centrality of collaboration to the development of his work and demonstrates that Fals-Borda’s embrace of the participatory paradigm stemmed from rejecting the centrality of historical materialism in favour of a model of research which supports and sustains the conditions for collective analysis and action through harnessing the creativity and wisdom of marginalized peoples. It concludes that for all the innovations in tools and techniques of action-oriented methods, the ontology of participation is what fundamentally differentiates PAR from other instrumental or top-down forms of people’s participation in research.
