  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>A growing literature measures the impact of education interventions in low- and middle-income countries on both access and learning outcomes. But how should one contextualize the size of impacts? This article provides the distribution of standardized effect sizes on learning and access from 234 studies in low- and middle-income countries. We identify a median effect size of 0.10 standard deviations on learning and 0.07 standard deviations on access among randomized controlled trials. Effect sizes are similar for quasi-experimental studies. Effects are larger and demonstrate higher variance for small-scale studies than for large-scale studies. The distribution of existing effects can help researchers and policymakers to situate new findings within current knowledge and design new studies with sufficient statistical power to identify effects.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>This study takes advantage of natural variation in alignment and accountability to analyze educator sensemaking of a complex policy environment. It describes how educators in two large, high-accountability districts in New York and Florida made sense of multiple policy changes, including new standards, curriculum, assessments, and teacher evaluation. Drawing on interviews with 68 individuals, observations of instruction and professional development, and policy documents, findings suggest that high policy alignment represents a fundamental yet insufficient condition for educators to perceive policies as coherent and coordinated. Accountability strength and policy sequence were important factors in educators’ perceptions of coherence. In both districts, the pace and complexity of change contributed to policy overwhelm.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Using unique statewide panel data from Tennessee, we describe instructional coach (IC) and teacher peer observer (TPO) distributions in terms of their teaching expertise and observable school and district characteristics. The evidence suggests ICs are more likely to work in districts with lower-performing teachers while working in schools with higher-performing teachers. District characteristics largely determine where TPOs work. We also find that ICs and TPOs possess relatively more teaching expertise than classroom teachers and that these positive differences grow in magnitude as the concentration of economically disadvantaged students in a school rises.

  Abstract
                    <p>While patterning was commonly seen as evidence of mathematical thinking, interdisciplinary interest has recently increased due to pattern-recognition applications in artificial intelligence. Within two empirical studies, we analyze the analogical-transfer capability of primary school students when completing three types of bi-dimensional patterns, namely, numerical, discrete geometric, and continuous geometric. We found that the mechanisms involved in analogical transfer for continuing sequential patterns are based on two complementary cognitive processes: decoding and adapting. In addition, at a basic level of processing, students activate one of the operational tools of shape recognition or counting, and based on it, they find a surface analogy that leads them to use isometric transformations or one-dimensional development for continuing the given pattern. At a more complex level of processing, students activate both shape recognition and counting and are thus able to apply a filter of processing that uncovers a deep-structure analogy, which allows cognitive framing of the problem and leads to coherent 2D developments within the understood conceptual frame. At a more advanced level of processing, students can use a refined filter not only to uncover a deep-structure analogy but also to use an external language to verbalize that analogy, and consequently, to find 2D developments that trigger changes in cognitive framing, showing that pattern generation is a creative activity. Teaching and learning implications are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In the age of artificial intelligence where standard problems are increasingly processed by computers, creative problem solving, the ability to think outside the box is in high demand. Collaboration is also increasingly significant, which makes creative collaboration an important twenty-first-century skill. In the research described in this paper, we investigated students’ collaborative creative process in mathematics and explored the collaborative creative process in its phases. Since little is known about the collaborative creative process, we conducted an explorative case study, where two students jointly worked on a multiple solution task. For in-depth insight into the dyad’s collaborative creative process, we used a novel research design in mathematics education, DUET SRI: both students wore eye-tracking glasses during their collaborative work for dual eye-tracking (DUET) and they each participated in a subsequent stimulated recall interview (SRI) where eye-tracking videos from their joint work served as stimulus. Using an inductive data analysis method, we then identified the phases of the students’ collaborative creative process. We found that the collaborative creative process and its phases had similarities to those previously found for solo creative work, yet the process was more complex and volatile and involved different branches. Based on our findings, we present a tentative model of the dyad’s collaborative process in its phases, which can help researchers and educators trace and foster the collaborative creative process more effectively.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In mathematics classrooms, educators encourage both creativity and collaboration. In the current study we investigated the dialogical moves that made up the interactions of three groups of post high-school students who worked on an open-ended mathematics task. The aim of this study was to characterize collective strategic pathways that can lead to different creativity products, and the possible impact of leadership styles and dialogical moves on those pathways. Collective strategic flexibility was defined as the number of strategies used by the group. Three strategy paths were found, namely, a disjointed strategy path, an emerging strategy path, and a straightforward strategy path. Dialogical moves such as asking for help, receiving clarifications, and explicating strategies, led to fluency. Elaborating mathematical explanations led to originality. Strategic flexibility was supported by evaluating strategies. Group leadership styles also contributed to varying amounts of cooperation and collaboration, in turn furthering different aspects of creativity. Findings indicated that cooperative collectives can lead to original unpredictable solutions. When a group is more collaborative, collective strategic flexibility may increase. When there is a mix, and students collaborate in a way that ensures that all can contribute, then collective fluency is promoted.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>For a century and a half, the scene of mathematics competitions underwent a remarkable transformation from isolated and geographically scattered events to a full-scale and a full-featured vibrant global ecosystem comprising an impressive variety of competitions, school students, university students, teachers, mentors, scientists, schools, universities, research institutions, journals, websites, civil society organizations, educational authorities, parents, etc. The evolution, the current state, the functioning of this ecosystem as well as its role for the identification and development of talent, its impact on the educational process, and the institutions involved with it, is briefly reflected on. Some relatively new online competitions are presented that cultivate the use of dynamic geometry software systems for a deeper understanding of mathematical facts and phenomena, and for finding approximate numerical solutions to problems that are not part of a typical school curriculum, but often arise from real-life practice.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Automatic admissions policies (AAPs, “percent plans”) redistribute college-going opportunities across segregated high schools to diversify college enrollments, increasing opportunities at predominantly minority high schools. If students “game” AAPs by attending schools with increased opportunities, AAPs could alter racial sorting across high schools. Comparative interrupted time series analyses provide evidence that Texas’s and California’s AAPs reduced Black–White segregation in highly segregated school districts. These effects were concentrated in sparsely populated areas in Texas, and they were modest in California, so it seems unlikely this significantly undermined AAPs’ ability to reduce racial disparities in college-going opportunities. It shows, however, that strategic responses to policies that redistribute opportunities in segregated contexts can create tension between segregation and inequality of opportunity.

                  <p>In this article, we direct attention to what becomes critical in teaching activities for toddlers (1–3-year-olds) to learn the meaning of numbers. One activity we thoroughly explore is interactive book reading, based on previous research indicating positive learning outcomes from this type of mathematical activity, as it has shown to simultaneously embrace the child’s perspective and encourage interaction and ‘number talk.’ A specially designed picture book presenting small quantities was developed, and variation theory principles were embedded in both the book design and the teaching acts. Through qualitative analyses, we aim to identify what is critical in the interactive book reading sessions for toddlers to discern essential aspects of numbers, with a specific focus on the conditions for making modes of representations into resources for learning. Preschool teachers frequently read the book to 27 toddlers over the course of a year. Video documentation of their reading sessions was analyzed, and exposed the significance of addressing the child’s perspective when choosing what representation to emphasize and in what ways connections within and between representations can be made. Thus, the study contributes knowledge on the teaching of numbers with toddlers, and problematizes as well as extends the potential of interactive book reading as a quality-enhancing educational tool.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The mental health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on PK–12 youth is likely an urgent and enduring concern, yet research on this topic is still emerging. To synthesize current knowledge, the researchers conducted a systematic review of empirical studies exploring the mental health impacts of COVID-19. Five themes emerged across 104 included studies: (a) the pandemic proved widely disruptive to PK–12 youth; (b) there was a clear connection between the mental health of caregivers (e.g., parents) and children; (c) the pandemic broadly increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in PK–12 youth; (d) students were particularly affected on the basis of age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and previous mental health or disability diagnosis; and (e) youth demonstrated negative and positive coping strategies and even saw some positive mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Our 2020 Educational Researcher article, “The Imperative of Social Foundations to (Urban) Education Research and Practice,” emphasizes three particular social foundations of education (SFE) subdisciplines (sociology of education, history of education, and philosophy of education) to demonstrate the strength and necessity of SFE as a multi-perspectival approach to resolving persistent education justice dilemmas. In their technical comment, Aydarova et al. (2021) insist that our article potentially facilitates “erasure of SFE’s complexity and interdisciplinarity” (p. 1). They, like us, care deeply that SFE be understood as indispensable to advancing racial justice in and beyond education research, policy, and practice. These scholars foreground the invaluable contributions of anthropology of education to oppose racism and accentuate justice-oriented education alternatives. This essay responds to the technical comment by clarifying what we find to be a fundamental misinterpretation of our argument and, ultimately, its scholarly purpose. Not only do we contend with our colleagues’ concern that our work is reductionist, we demonstrate how Aydarova et al.’s urgent call to foreground SFE’s interdisciplinary nature further underscores the central argument made in our 2020 paper.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>States and broad-access colleges are rapidly scaling corequisite coursework—a model where students concurrently enroll in college-level and developmental coursework—in response to dismal completion rates in traditional “developmental” sequences. At community colleges, evidence suggests that corequisite reforms can dramatically improve students’ completion of required college-level courses, but colleges often implement new programing and sequences with limited information. We analyzed administrative data from Texas community colleges implementing a statewide corequisite mandate. Our results illustrate (a) how colleges structured corequisite courses in response to the statewide mandate and (b) how corequisite coursework characteristics predicted student outcomes. Our results suggest that some corequisite coursework elements—including mixed-ability college-level classes, higher credits for the developmental education (dev-ed) corequisite support course, and using the same instructor across both the college-level and dev-ed course—improve students’ probability of passing college-level math, though these course design elements do not appear to predict long-term outcomes like persistence in college.

  Abstract
                    <p>Relationships between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity have been widely studied, but few studies are available for primary school age. For an investigation in this age group, it seems appropriate to use a content area that not only has high relevance for mathematics and special potentials for creativity, but also requires only a little knowledge and is easily accessible. We therefore investigated whether mathematically gifted primary school students differ from non-gifted ones in high creativity in dealing with mathematical patterns and structures. This question was explored in an interview study in which 24 third graders were asked to invent as many different figural patterns as possible, which enabled creative mathematical activity also by combining arithmetic and geometric aspects. A detailed qualitative analysis of the data revealed among other results several types of flexibility concerning the invention of patterns. The selection of students ensured that all participants performed well to very well in regular mathematics classes and that 14 of them could additionally be assumed to be mathematically gifted based on a specific test. This allowed a comparison of both subgroups. Results indicate a high correspondence between mathematical giftedness and mathematical creativity concerning the invention of figural patterns.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>One of the well-known approaches to creativity differentiates between creative person, process, product, and press. In the study presented in this paper we focus on creative process and product associated with Problem Posing through Investigation (PPI) by experts in mathematical problem solving. We link the creative process to creativity of PPI strategies and the creative product to PPI outcomes (i.e., strategy creativity and outcome creativity). Furthermore, we draw a connection between the openness of tasks and their power for the evaluation of strategy creativity and outcome creativity, demonstrate the aptness of PPI tasks for the evaluation of both types of creativity, and examine the connections between them. The model for the evaluation of creativity that we used in this study, was initially designed and validated using analysis of problem-solving strategies when solving multiple solution tasks. We previously extended the model to evaluation of PPI outcomes, and we here demonstrate its implementation to evaluation of creativity of PPI strategies. To examine connections between creativity of PPI strategies and creativity of PPI outcomes, we focused on PPI by eight experts in mathematical problem solving who were members or candidates of the Israeli IMO team. We present empirical evidence for the distinctions between strategy creativity and outcome creativity, and for the connections between them. We analyzed strategy creativity as a unique characteristic of problem-solving experts. We found that higher strategy creativity does not necessarily lead to higher outcome creativity, and that a high level of strategy originality correlates with outcome flexibility. We conclude that creative product and creative process are two distinct characteristics of cognitive processing linked to creativity-directed problem solving.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this special issue we introduce the state of the art of empirical studies on creativity in mathematics and mathematics education. To do so we conducted a retrospective analysis of empirical studies on mathematical creativity with special attention to the studies conducted during the last decade. In the paper we present a brief survey of research on mathematical creativity up to 2009 and then a detailed review of empirical studies performed during the past decade. We note an optimistic development of attention paid to mathematical creativity in schools. A systematic search conducted to examine research on creativity in mathematics education journals and research in the field of mathematics in creativity-related journals, yielded 49 papers that described empirical studies on creativity in mathematics education. The retrospective analysis examined the following: (a) the main goals of the studies; (b) conceptual frameworks used by the researchers; (c) research methodologies; and (d) tools and tasks. Of these, 18 studies examined the relationships between creativity in mathematics and other characteristics, 25 were on creativity related to instructional practices and mathematical tasks, and 6 studies investigated teachers’ creativity-related conceptions and competencies. Of these studies, 29 used quantitative methodologies, 10 of which integrated analysis for problem solving or problem posing strategies or outcomes. Ten additional studies employed qualitative methodology (mainly content analysis of lesson observations). We conclude the paper with a short review of papers in this special issue, and outline directions for future research on creativity in mathematics (education).</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this paper, the construct of ‘uncertainty’ in professional mathematics is investigated in relation to mathematical creativity. Specific focus is on ‘Big C’ research mathematicians’ conceptions of what uncertainty means and ways in which it influences their research. Based on the hypothesis that uncertainty is both a catalyst and a necessary condition for creativity, a qualitative research design was used to obtain and analyze data from a 4-year study involving 18 research mathematicians who were at the forefront of their research domains. Data analysis using analytic induction confirmed the hypothesis that uncertainty plays an important role as a catalyst of mathematical creativity. The emergent categories from qualitative analysis revealed a dialectic or tension between (1) logic versus heuristics (synthetic versus analytic), (2) learner-researcher and researcher-learner transition, (3) axiom tweaking versus constraints. The findings of the study indicate that textbooks, unexpected moments, risk taking, and a community of support play a crucial role and characterize the interplay of uncertainty with mathematical creativity. The schema for understanding the dialectics of uncertainty sheds new light on an hitherto unexplored aspect of mathematical creativity, namely, uncertainty, vital for the development of mathematicians as researchers in addition to the growth of their discipline.</p>
