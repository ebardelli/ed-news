  Abstract
      
                    <p>Students’ issues dealing with reflection tasks, especially with inclined mirror lines, are widely known. Previous research conducted with primary school students mainly focussed on task difficulty and students’ outcomes, especially their errors of reflection. Little is known about which not obviously sustainable understanding of reflection leads to what kind of errors. To address this issue, the purpose of this study is to explore which approaches students use in their solution finding processes when dealing with reflection tasks. We also investigated whether there was a relationship between the students’ approaches and correct or incorrect solution products. This article discusses a task-based interview study focussing on approaches used in the students’ solution process of four reflection tasks. To gather data, 42 interviews with students at the end of primary school in Germany were conducted. For the analysis, a category system with the categories “properties of reflection,” “holistic approaches,” “gestures and actions illustrating the process of reflection,” and “mental images illustrating the process of reflection,” was developed and validated. We observed that there is a relation between the approaches used by the students during their process of solving reflection tasks and their solution products. The observed relationship between the approaches applied during the solution processes and the solutions themselves leads to the assumption that the approaches the students used reveal varying degrees of mathematical understanding of reflection. As emphasized in the discussion of the results, it is important to take a differentiated look on the students’ solution products and the importance of adequate instruction methods.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>In this article, we report on a typology of the demands of statistical and mathematical products (StaMPs) embedded in media items related to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The typology emerged from a content analysis of a large purposive sample of diverse media items selected from digital news sources based in four countries. The findings encompass nine categories of StaMPs: (1) descriptive quantitative information, (2) models, predictions, causality and risk, (3) representations and displays, (4) data quality and strength of evidence, (5) demographics and comparative thinking, (6) heterogeneity and contextual factors, (7) literacy and language demands, (8) multiple information sources, and (9) critical demands. We illustrate these categories via selected media items, substantiate them through relevant research literature, and point to categories that encompass new or enhanced types of demands. Our findings offer insights into the rich set of capabilities that citizens (including both young people and adults) must possess in order to engage these mass media demands, critically analyze statistical and mathematical information in the media, evaluate the meaning and credibility of news reports, understand public policies, and make evidenced-informed judgments. Our conclusions point to the need to revise current curricular frameworks and conceptual models (e.g., regarding statistical and probability literacy, adult numeracy), to better incorporate notions such as blended knowledge, vagueness, risk, strength of evidence, and criticality. Furthermore, more attention is needed to the literacy and language demands of media items involving statistical and mathematical information. Implications for further research and educational practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>In mathematics education research, proofs are often conceptualized as sequences of mathematical assertions. We argue that this ignores proofs that contain instructions to perform mathematical actions, often in the form of imperatives, which are common both in mathematical practice and in undergraduate mathematics textbooks. We consider in detail a specific type of proof which we call a recipe proof, which is comprised of sequence of instructions that direct the reader to produce mathematical objects with desirable properties. We present a model of what it means to understand a recipe proof and use this model in conjunction with process-object theories from mathematics education research, to explain why recipe proofs are inherently difficult for students to understand.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Isomorphism and homomorphism are topics central to abstract algebra, but research on mathematicians’ views of these topics, especially with respect to sameness, remains limited. This study examines open response survey data from 197 mathematicians on how sameness could be helpful or harmful when studying isomorphism and homomorphism. Using thematic analysis, we examined whether sameness was viewed as helpful or harmful for isomorphism and homomorphism before examining rationales for those views. Making use of values of the mathematical community, we note that mathematicians saw conceptual and pedagogical benefits to connecting isomorphism and sameness, which connects to leveraging intuition and valuing ways of increasing understanding. Mathematicians’ concerns around using sameness largely revolved around the violation of the mathematical community’s idealized value of expressing a priori truth via a-contextual justifications. However, these concerns can be addressed through only targeted usage of sameness and explicit discussions around the utility and relevance of sameness. Implications include the importance of considering how interventions proposed by mathematics educators align with or provoke tension between values held by the mathematical community in order to mitigate or lean into those tensions and encourage fruitful dialogue between the mathematics and mathematics education communities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Within educational research, dyslexia and other disabilities are typically conceptualized as deficits. The theory of neurodiversity encourages researchers to conceptualize cognitive differences as natural forms of human diversity with unique sets of challenges and strengths. Using neurodiversity as our theoretical framework, we analyze the experiences of five research mathematicians with dyslexia as told through personal narratives to find common strengths and challenges for dyslexic thinkers at the highest level of mathematics. We report on 4 themes: (1) highly visual and intuitive ways of mathematical thinking, (2) issues with language and translation between forms, (3) issues with memorization of mathematical facts and procedures, and (4) resilience as a strength of dyslexia that matters in mathematics. We use our participants’ insights to explore how neurodiversity, a theory of cognitive disability developed by and for neurodiverse people, could expand opportunities for research. We call for mathematics educators to consider the strengths and challenges of dyslexic learners, as well as valuing expertise from insider perspectives.</p>

  Abstract
      
                  <p>This study aimed to explore preservice elementary teachers’ use of a bar model as a heuristic for conceptualising relationships between quantities in situations involving ratio and percentages. As a part of a larger project, we focused on two preservice teachers, Maia and Jane, and investigated their solution paths in ratio and percentage problems and the role of the structural representations (i.e., bar model and percent line-bar model) in their solution paths. We analysed these focus participants’ written solutions and their think-aloud process during interviews using three coding phases with a constructivist grounded theory approach. We observed that the problem text fed the construction of the structural representations that served to make sense of the quantities and the relationships among them. Furthermore, the structural representations enhanced Maia and Jane’s mathematical insights about the problem situations. In addition, we observed that preservice teachers’ solution paths were neither linear nor similar, which indicates a mathematical richness in learning. In those solution paths, the model construction played a role in guiding the mathematical operations of constructing and operating on a unit rate in the ratio problem and identifying and operating on a referent whole unit in the percentage problem. We interpreted that variety and nonlinearity in solution paths suggested mathematical richness in learning, the educational implications of which were further discussed.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Scholars argue that the “racial achievement gap” frame perpetuates deficit mindsets. Previously, we found that teachers gave lower priority to racial equity when disparities were framed as “achievement gaps” (AGs) versus “inequality in educational outcomes.” In this brief, we analyze data from two survey experiments using a teacher sample and an Amazon MTurk sample. We find that (a) the effect of AG language on equity prioritization is moderated by implicit bias, with larger negative effects among teachers holding stronger anti-Black/pro-White stereotypes; (b) the negative effect of AG language replicates with non-teachers; and (c) AG language causes respondents to express more negative racial stereotypes.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the nonpartisan research and analytical arm of the U.S. Congress and is physically and structurally located within the Library of Congress. Despite the role of CRS as a critical information provider and technical assistant to actors crafting and implementing federal policy, CRS reports, which serve as a key mechanism of information dissemination and influence by the organization, only became widely available to the public following the adoption of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. This study uses content analysis to examine CRS’s education-related reports from the 115th Congress to explore what sources are directly and indirectly informing federal policymaking based on references in CRS reports. Findings offer insights into research utilization in the federal education policy process and contribute to the growing literature on intermediary organizations and knowledge brokering.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>This article presents a latent class model for multilevel data to identify latent subgroups and estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. Unlike sequential approaches that partition data first and then estimate average treatment effects (ATEs) within classes, we employ a Bayesian procedure to jointly estimate mixing probability, selection, and outcome models so that misclassification does not obstruct estimation of treatment effects. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method finds the correct number of latent classes, estimates class-specific treatment effects well, and provides proper posterior standard deviations and credible intervals of ATEs. We apply this method to Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data to investigate the effects of private science lessons on achievement scores and then find two latent classes, one with zero ATE and the other with positive ATE.

  Abstract
                  <p>The success or failure of education systems in promoting student problem-solving skills depends on attitudinal, political, and pedagogical variables. Among these variables, the design of mathematics textbooks is thought to partially explain why students from high-achieving countries show better problem-solving ability in international assessments. In the current study, we delved into this question and compared the frequency and characteristics of arithmetic word problems (AWPs) contained in primary school math textbooks in two countries with different levels of performance in international assessments—Singapore and Spain. In our analyses, we focused on (1) the quantity of arithmetic word problems, (2) the variety of problems in terms of their additive or multiplicative structures and semantic-mathematical substructures, and (3) the quantity and nature of illustrations that were presented together with arithmetic word problems. Although a larger proportion of AWP activities was found in Singaporean textbooks, the results showed a similar variety of AWPs in both Singaporean and Spanish math textbooks. Furthermore, in both countries, math textbooks emphasized the structures classified as (additive) combine 1 and (multiplication) simple rate in AWPs. Notably, the Singaporean textbook contained a larger percentage of illustrations that reflected the semantic-mathematical structures of the problems and helped students learn how to solve AWPs (e.g., bar models). The findings are discussed in light of theories that posit that textbooks constitute a fundamental part of the teaching–learning process in the classroom.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent national lockdown in South Africa induced a rapid, albeit challenging, implementation of blended learning (with a strong online focus) at all educational levels. During this time, a group of teachers were involved in a specialised computer integrated education course, preparing them for the design and implementation of technologically enhanced modes of teaching. In this research we considered the positive impact of the situation during the pandemic on these mathematics teachers’ practice, as well as their conceptualisation of the way forward for technology enhanced mathematics education. We conducted an explorative survey study, employing an enactivist approach, to investigate their experiences of addressing procedural and conceptual aspects of mathematics education, as well as their observations of learners’ reactions to these changed practices. Our findings show that participants experienced their exposure to technology as creating an environment they foresee will have a lasting impact on their teaching practice. Participants emphasised the importance of using educational technology meaningfully as a cognitive tool that allows for learners to learn with the technology and not from the technology, which impacts on the importance of learner-centred teaching strategies and the development of high cognitive level interactive learning activities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Variance and invariance are two powerful mathematical ideas to support geometrical and spatial thinking, yet there is limited research about teachers’ knowledge of variance and invariance. In this paper, we examined how high school teachers deal with the task of looking for invariant properties in a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) setting. Specifically, we investigated if they even attend to invariant properties; what invariant properties they discern and discuss; and how DGE can support such discernment. Our analysis found that teachers tend to discern and discuss invariant properties mainly when they were probed to consider invariance. We also found four categories of invariant properties that seem to be important for a robust and rich understanding of geometric objects in the context of invariance and DGE. The use of DGE allowed teachers to see and interact with invariant properties, thus suggesting that accessing geometry dynamically may have structural affordances especially when exploring invariance. Teachers were able to enact different DGE movements to discern and discuss invariant properties, as well as to reason with and about them. We also saw that teachers’ backgrounds and past experiences can play an important role in their descriptions of invariant properties. Possible future research directions and implications to teacher education are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
      
                    <p>Drawing bar diagrams has been shown to improve performance on mathematical word problems wherein the relational keyword is consistent with the required arithmetic operation. This study extends this by testing the effectiveness of bar diagram drawing for word problems with an inconsistent keyword-arithmetic operation mapping. Seventy-five fifth graders solved consistent and inconsistent word problems while encouraged to draw bar diagrams. For each word problem, we assessed problem type (consistent/inconsistent), performance (correct/incorrect), and bar diagrams (accurate/inaccurate/no drawing). Overall, bar diagram drawing was associated with increased performance on both consistent and inconsistent word problems, but the strongest benefits of drawing were found for inconsistent word problems. For inconsistent word problems, bar diagram accuracy was more clearly related to performance (accurate bar diagrams related to correct answers, but inaccurate ones to incorrect answers) than for consistent word problems. We conclude that bar diagram drawing provides an effective graphical support for solving inconsistent word problems.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>An essential task for mathematics teachers is posing problems. Selecting mathematics problems that develop mathematical proficiency and engage students in desirable mathematical practices is a critical decision-making process. We present the Framework for Posing Elementary Mathematics Problems (F-PosE) developed to focus prospective teacher noticing on desirable features of mathematics problems and inform decision-making processes around the selection of problems for use in elementary classrooms. Development of the framework was informed by a three-phase design research process consisting of an extensive review of the literature, document content analysis and successive testing of mathematics problems in elementary classrooms in partnership with teachers and children. Consequently, it draws from emergent practice informed by the collective endeavour of a community of educators. The framework consists of eight indicators: use of a motivating and engaging context, clarity in language and cultural context, curriculum coherence, attention to cognitive demand, an appropriate number of solution steps to support reasoning, a variety of solution strategies, facilitating multiple solutions and opportunity for success. This F-PosE provides a critical focusing lens for prospective teachers when creating and selecting mathematics problems specifically for use in elementary classrooms.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Around the world the prevalence of mathematics anxiety and disengagement point to a poor sense of student ‘mathematical wellbeing’. Mathematical wellbeing is defined here as the fulfilment of one’s ultimate or core values, accompanied by positive feelings and functioning in mathematics education. Yet student wellbeing and how to support it in specific school subjects including mathematics is vastly under-researched. Also, despite outperforming other countries in international mathematics assessments, East Asian students generally appear to experience poor affect and high academic burden in mathematics education, which are indicative of poor mathematical wellbeing. In this context, this explorative and descriptive study investigates the values that are associated with the mathematical wellbeing of a cohort of Chinese primary school students. 258 Grade three students in Chengdu, China responded to a questionnaire which explored teacher-nominated mathematics learning moments that students valued most for their mathematical wellbeing. Findings pointed to students valuing all the learning moments to some extent, with good grades, fun and interest, mathematics-themed videos, and teacher praise rated most commonly for wellbeing. The values underlying these learning moments are similar to the seven mathematical wellbeing dimensions found in Australian classrooms. The findings also highlight the cultural subjectivities involved, in which the same classroom actions can reflect different underlying values across cultures, and in which a particular value can be espoused in different ways in different places. We also look ahead to suggest how teachers might support students’ mathematical wellbeing, by recognising and then fulfilling their students’ values in the mathematics classroom.</p>

Forty-one in-service Mathematics teachers participated in this study. The research tools used in the study included a lesson taken from the VIDEO-LM project and articles that were all presented to the teachers. Our work with an open-ended questionnaire and mixed-methods analysis revealed that exposing in-service teachers to theoretical and empirical articles may affect the three components of their professional noticing performance: attending, interpreting, and responding. After the exposure to the articles, the teachers exhibited a greater focus on the specific difficulties inherent in the specific task at hand and their subsequent interpretations of those difficulties and responses to those difficulties were also more specific than they had been before the intervention.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>High school Career and Technical Education (CTE) has received increased attention from policymakers and researchers in recent years. This study fills a needed gap in the growing research base by examining heterogeneity within the wide range of programs falling under the broad moniker of CTE, highlighting the need for nuance in research and policy conversations that often consider CTE as monolithic. Using student-level course-taking records, unemployment insurance, and National Student Clearinghouse data, we examine outcomes including earnings, postsecondary education, and poverty avoidance. We find substantial differences for students in fields as diverse as health care, Information Technology (IT), and construction. We also highlight heterogeneity for student populations historically overrepresented in CTE, and we find large differences in outcomes for CTE students, particularly by gender.
