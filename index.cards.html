  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematics discussions are important for helping students to develop conceptual understanding and to learn disciplinary norms and practices. In recent years, there has been increased attention to teaching prospective teachers to lead discussions with students. This paper examines the possibilities of designing a formative assessment that gathers information about prospective elementary teachers’ skills with leading problem-based mathematics discussions and makes sense of such information. A decomposition of the practice of leading discussions was developed and used to design the assessment. Nine first-year teachers who graduated from a range of different teacher education programs participated in the study. The findings reveal that our formative assessment works to gather information about teachers’ capabilities with leading discussions and that the associated tools support making sense of the information gathered. This suggests that such tools could be useful to support the formative assessment of the developing capabilities of prospective teachers.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>English learners (ELs) in K–12 schools must acquire English while simultaneously mastering content knowledge. Educational technology may support students’ learning through the affordance of individualized language practice. The current randomized controlled trial intervention study examined the effects of Rosetta Stone Foundations software on English learning among middle school ELs. The study took place in Grades 6 to 8 of an urban U.S. school district (N = 221). Predictors of interest included time of testing (pretest vs. posttest) and software usage, and covariates included grade level, sex, and attendance. Additionally, socioeconomic status and home language were accounted for due to sample homogeneity. Multilevel models indicated that treatment group students showed larger gains than control group students on oral/aural outcomes. These results indicate that the software intervention enables individualized practice that can produce proficiency-related gains over and above the typical classroom curriculum.

  Educational Researcher, Volume 50, Issue 5, Page 315-324, June/July 2021. <br>The COVID-19 school closures highlighted the importance of crisis management for school and district leaders. Crisis management, however, has not received sufficient attention from school leadership preparation programs or education leadership researchers. This article synthesizes research spanning schools and other organizations, including those in the private sector, to describe a framework for understanding crises and crisis management in schools and districts and the key competences this literature suggests for successful navigation of crisis situations. We use this framework to discuss leaders’ responses to the COVID-19 school closures in spring 2020. We conclude with an argument for more consciously incorporating crisis management training into both preservice and in-service preparation and support for education leaders and for opening new lines of inquiry into crisis leadership at the school and district levels.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper reports on empirical results about the influence of two different teaching designs on the development of tertiary students’ modelling competency and attitudes towards modelling. A total of 144 first year engineering students were exposed to a diagnostic entrance test, a modelling unit consisting of five lessons with ten tasks, enframed by a pre- and a post-test, and at the end a questionnaire on attitudes towards mathematical modelling. Similar to the German DISUM study, in the modelling unit, one group of participants followed an independence-oriented teaching style, aiming at a balance between students’ independent work and teacher’s guidance, while two other groups were taught according to a more traditional teacher-guided style. Linear mixed regression models were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The results show that all groups had significant learning progress, although there is much room for further improvement, and that the group taught according to the independence-oriented design had the biggest competency growth. In addition, this group exhibited more positive attitudes than the other groups in five of six attitudinal aspects.</p>

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 411-429, June 2021. <br>In empirical work, researchers frequently test hypotheses of parallel form in several regressions, which raises concerns about multiple testing. One way to address the multiple-testing issue is to jointly test the hypotheses (for example, Pei, Pischke, and Schwandt [2019, Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics 37: 205–216] and Lee and Lemieux [2010, Journal of Economic Literature 48: 281–355]). While the existing commands suest (Weesie, 1999, Stata Technical Bulletin Reprints 9: 231–248) and mvreg enable Stata users to follow this approach, both are limited in several dimensions. For instance, mvreg assumes homoskedasticity and uncorrelatedness across sampling units, and neither command is designed to be used with panel data. In this article, we introduce the new community-contributed command stackreg, which overcomes the aforementioned limitations and allows for some settings and features that go beyond the capabilities of the existing commands. To achieve this, stackreg runs an ordinary least-squares regression in which the regression equations are stacked as described, for instance, in Wooldridge (2010, Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, p. 166–173, MIT Press) and applies cluster–robust variance–covariance estimation.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Support groups are one possibility to empower informal carers and accordingly have spread across many countries because of their informal, inexpensive nature and because of their effectiveness. This paper aims to reflect on the viewpoints and experiences of the lessons learned from the participatory action research (PAR) conducted from 2016 to 2019. During PAR, several support groups in different regions of Estonia were launched to empower the informal caregivers. In the study, the stakeholders and researchers participated as partners and developed new knowledge and 17 support groups were launched in different regions of Estonia.In conclusion, our experiences highlighted the stakeholders’ collaboration which resulted in creating the knowledge needed to launch support groups. Based on our experience, we recommend launching support groups in countries where they do not exist yet, and to apply participatory action research.

  Abstract
                  <p>Problem solving and problem posing have long been of interest to the mathematics education community. In this survey paper we first look at some of the seminal moments in the history of research on the important topics. We then use this history to position the state-of-the-art research being done in both problem solving and problem posing, before introducing the presented state-of-the-art developments in problem solving and problem posing. We then use this work as a backdrop against which to introduce the 16 empirical papers that make up this special issue. Together these 16 papers add nuance to what is already known about problem solving and problem posing; this nuance is the result of attending to very specific contexts and purposes in which these activities are embedded. We end the paper by discussing the future directions these fields can take.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Though there is widespread recognition of the importance of implementation research, evaluators often face intense logistical, budgetary, and methodological challenges in their efforts to assess intervention implementation in the field. This article proposes a set of natural language processing techniques called semantic similarity as an innovative and scalable method of measuring implementation constructs. Semantic similarity methods are an automated approach to quantifying the similarity between texts. By applying semantic similarity to transcripts of intervention sessions, researchers can use the method to determine whether an intervention was delivered with adherence to a structured protocol, and the extent to which an intervention was replicated with consistency across sessions, sites, and studies. This article provides an overview of semantic similarity methods, describes their application within the context of educational evaluations, and provides a proof of concept using an experimental study of the impact of a standardized teacher coaching intervention.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Using the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), this study documents that rural and small-town students were significantly less likely to enroll in postsecondary STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) degree programs, compared with their suburban peers. This study also shows that schools attended by rural and small-town students offered limited access to advanced coursework and extracurricular programs in STEM and had lower STEM teaching capacity. Those opportunities to learn in STEM were linked to the widening geographic gaps in STEM academic preparation. Overall, our findings suggest that during high school rural and small-town students shifted away from STEM fields and that geographic disparities in postsecondary STEM participation were largely explained by students’ demographics and precollege STEM career aspirations and academic preparation.

  Abstract
                  <p>In Germany, the Abitur is the highest qualification granted at the end of secondary education after 12 or 13 years of schooling; it provides a general university entrance qualification. Traditionally, written and oral examinations are required to obtain the Abitur. Until 1990, there were mainly decentralized examinations in mathematics in West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany [FRG]), which were taken after 13 school years, and a centralized examination that students took after 12 years of school in East Germany (German Democratic Republic [GDR]). In the unified Germany, examinations are now increasingly set by the 16 individual federal states. This paper has a special focus on changes and permanent features in the written Abitur examination in mathematics in Germany in the context of the social changes caused by the German reunification in 1990. These changes since 1990 are described with regard to the initial situation and framing conditions for the written Abitur examination. Two time periods are considered: (1) the examination situation in the FRG and GDR before 1990 and (2) the changes in the five eastern German federal states (former GDR) under the system change and accession to the FRG after 1990 but before the PISA shock.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>This article estimates the relationship between students’ psychosocial and academic outcomes during their first 3 years enrolled at public, 4-year institutions. Our sample comprises students from low-income backgrounds who applied for a competitive scholarship and enrolled at a 4-year public institution. We follow two cohorts of entering students throughout their first 3 years on campus. We observe their cumulative grade point average and persistence decisions each semester, and have annual measures of four psychosocial outcomes: mattering to campus, sense of belonging to campus, academic self-efficacy, and social self-efficacy. We find that psychosocial outcomes are moderately predictive of academic outcomes, with sense of belonging and academic self-efficacy emerging as most predictive of both cumulative grade point avaerage and persistence.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 360-410, June 2021. <br>The Kitagawa–Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition approach has been widely used to attribute group-level differences in an outcome to differences in endowment, coefficients, and their interactions. The method has been implemented for Stata in the popular oaxaca command for cross-sectional analyses. In recent decades, however, research questions have been more often focused on the decomposition of group-based differences in change over time, for example, diverging income trajectories, as well as decomposition of change in differences between groups, for example, change in the gender pay gap over time. We review five existing methods for the decomposition of changes in group means and contribute an extension that takes an interventionist perspective suitable for applications with a clear before–after comparison.These decompositions of levels and changes over time can be implemented using the xtoaxaca command, which works as a postestimation command for different regression commands in Stata. It is built to maximize flexibility in modeling and implements all decomposition techniques presented in this article.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 21, Issue 2, Page 320-347, June 2021. <br>Recognizing a dose–response pattern based on heterogeneous tables of contrasts is hard. Specification of a statistical model that can consider the possible dose–response data-generating mechanism, including its variation across studies, is crucial for statistical inference. The aim of this article is to increase the understanding of mixed-effects dose–response models suitable for tables of correlated estimates. One can use the command drmeta with additive (mean difference) and multiplicative (odds ratios, hazard ratios) measures of association. The postestimation command drmeta_graph greatly facilitates the visualization of predicted average and study-specific dose–response relationships. I illustrate applications of the drmeta command with regression splines in experimental and observational data based on nonlinear and random-effects data-generation mechanisms that can be encountered in health-related sciences.
