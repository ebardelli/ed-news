  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Family separation policies’ impacts on children’s education and well-being are critical issues of our time. This paper argues through ethnographic study that although im/migrant parents believed in the promise of a better life for their children as they migrated, COVID-19 and remote schooling contributed to a breakdown in structures of care once they were in the United States. Thus, the experience of remote schooling during 2020 was a difficult task for parents and children who were already dealing with the trauma of detention or separation at the border. Ultimately, we argue that to understand the educational experiences of im/migrant parents and children in the United States, we must consider a multiple disruptions framework. The findings in this article reveal the layered consequences that broader immigration policy has on the everyday educational lives of im/migrant children and their parents.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we elaborate the seeds of algebraic thinking perspective, drawing upon Knowledge in Pieces as a heuristic epistemological framework. We argue that students’ pre-instructional experiences in early childhood lay the foundation for algebraic thinking and are a largely untapped resource in developing students’ algebraic thinking in the classroom. We theorize that seeds of algebraic thinking are cognitive resources abstracted over many interactions with the world in children’s pre-instructional experience. Further, we provide examples to demonstrate how the same seeds of algebraic thinking present in early childhood can be invoked in reasoning across contexts, grade levels, and different levels of formality of algebraic instruction. The examples demonstrate how the seeds perspective differs from other accounts of the relationship between children’s early activity and their engagement in algebraic reasoning processes. We anticipate this new theoretical direction for characterizing the nature and development of algebraic thinking will lay the foundation for a robust agenda that sheds light on the development of algebraic thinking and informs algebra instruction, particularly how teachers notice and respond to children’s developing algebraic thinking.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The past decade has witnessed a strong, standards-based call for improving what mathematics is taught and how it is taught. In the USA, districts have hired instructional coaches to help teachers shift their teaching from algorithm-based instruction to instruction that is more student-centered and conceptually focused. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the field’s understanding of (a) the specific coaching practices that help teachers enact more conceptual-based forms of instruction; and (b) how coaches learn to enact those practices. Using a design-based implementation research approach, we trained coaches using a particular model for one-on-one coaching (Content-Focused Coaching); the coaches then worked with teachers to plan lessons aligned with the coaching model. Data consisted of videotapes of pre-lesson conferences that were transcribed and coded according to the model. Analyses of 32 coaches’ practice over a 2-year period suggest that each of the three components of our coaching model (attention to student thinking, pedagogy, and mathematics) demonstrated statistically significant improvement over time. An illustrative analysis of five coaching sessions of one coach revealed a progression over five sessions from planning discussions that stayed at the level of general strategies to more specific conversations about teaching a particular task and then to deeper discussions that integrate attention to mathematical concepts, student thinking, and pedagogical moves. We view this delineation of coach learning as an important first step in laying the groundwork for the design of future coach training.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Responding to mathematical problems is a core activity in classrooms. The problems that teachers select determine the mathematical content, processes and nature of mathematical inquiry occurring in classrooms and thereby contribute to the development of mathematical skills and dispositions. Selecting, designing or reformulating mathematical problems is a critical skill, then, for prospective and practising teachers. This study explores the influence of a mathematical letter writing initiative in developing the problem posing skills of 28 prospective primary teachers. We examine the characteristics of mathematical problems designed by prospective teachers, and their understandings of what constitutes a good mathematical problem, prior to and following completion of a 12-week letter writing initiative with 10–11-year-old children. Analysis of the data reveals the benefits of engaging in the initiative as evidenced in improvements in several problem characteristics. There was an increase in the number of multiple approach and multiple solution problems and in the level of cognitive demand of problems posed. The challenge of posing non-traditional problems, alongside the competing demands of building in opportunities for success, may have diminished participants’ ability to evaluate and attend to the cognitive demand of problems.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Kyouzaikenkyuu (translated as instructional materials research) is said to be a crucial part of successful Japanese lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu is described as the planning portion of the research lesson during lesson study. Kyouzaikenkyuu is also said to be done on a daily basis by Japanese teachers; however, there is very little written about this process in the literature. This study takes an in-depth look into what Japanese junior high mathematics teachers do during their daily kyouzaikenkyuu, and why they do it. Through interviews, observations, and participation in kyouzaikenkyuu, we explain the process and key ideas that many Japanese mathematics teachers go through to prepare their lessons. We document two different approaches to kyouzaikenkyuu. We also found that for some teachers there is a large difference between what they do during kyouzaikenkyuu for a research lesson compared to the kyouzaikenkyuu of a daily lesson. If teachers outside of Japan wish to engage in kyouzaikenkyuu and lesson study, these approaches are a good place to start.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The globalization of commercial exchanges and capital movements reveal new ways of obtaining value in economic activities, and the differences in the tax burden of companies, depending on where they reside, have become threats for countries to exercise the right to tax business profits generated in its jurisdiction. This problem, together with tax competition between countries, causes a transfer of tax bases towards countries with lower tax rates and tax havens. The lack of agreement in the international community on how to find a solution to the problems has caused several countries to choose to establish special taxes for certain activities of multinational companies in their jurisdictions, resulting in inefficient taxes. This paper analyzes the agreement reached in October 2021 in the G20 and in the OECD in which measures are adopted within the BEPS project to prevent the erosion of tax bases in market jurisdictions promoted by multinational companies. After studying different aspects, we found fundamental reasons for not having an optimistic view on the effective solution to the problems above: unrealistic forecasts on the amount of the new estimated tax bases for Pillar 1 and the high administration and compliance costs. In conclusion, it is not foreseeable that the tax bases derived from the provision of digital services will suffer a territorial redistribution. We do not expect that a minimum tax rate of 15% in corporate tax will be carried out effectively or that the benefits that are transferred to tax havens will be significantly reduced.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the research reported in this paper we investigated teachers’ changes when adopting and adapting to emergency online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG). By adapting complementary accounts methodology to research into teachers’ changes when addressing the unexpected migration to online teaching, an integrated data set, including online teaching videos, teacher daily reflections, and teacher interviews from two purposefully selected teachers over two weeks of online teaching, was collected and analyzed qualitatively. Both teachers encountered different difficulties and thus had different knowledge changes displayed in different change routes. For the experienced teacher, students’ mistakes in homework and her online teaching practice triggered her knowledge changes. For the young teacher, the online video lessons, relevant resources on the Internet and students’ performance were her primary sources that triggered the changes of her knowledge for teaching. These differences between the experienced teacher and young teacher provide evidence of the complexity of teacher’s professional growth, which is related to a variety of external and internal factors. This study demonstrates how the IMPG model helps uncover teachers’ changes in such an unprecedented virtual-teaching environment. Finally, the implications of this study for teacher professional development in general are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study articulates the epistemological support of reflective practices for the professional practice of crafting mathematics problems in realistic contexts. The data were collected from 15 middle school pre-service mathematics teachers in two semesters as they were generating problems and engaging in three reflective practices, which served to elicit their knowledge-in-action. The prospective teachers’ reflections indicated that the knowledge-in-action for crafting realistic mathematics problems encompassed various but particular forms of the content; that is, pedagogical, curricular, and interdisciplinary forms of the content. Thus, particularly for the professional practice of crafting realistic mathematics problems, the prospective teachers identified epistemological supports that blended not only content and pedagogy but also other knowledge dimensions, which have crucial implications for mathematics teacher education.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper focuses on the discourse of teachers and instructors in a TEAMS (Teaching Exploratively for All Mathematics Students) professional development (PD) setting and on the discursive mechanisms that afford such learning. We conceptualize learning in this PD as a change in a teacher's pedagogical discourse—from alignment with Delivery Pedagogical Discourse (DPD) to alignment with Explorative Pedagogical Discourse (EPD). This change in pedagogical discourse involves commognitive conflicts between the DPD and EPD. Data for the study include 8 videotaped sessions from a 2-year TEAMS PD for middle school mathematics teachers. Results show that conflict revolved around four themes. The most common was about students' abilities and its relation to instruction. The others were: Who is responsible for constructing mathematics knowledge in class? Limited view of the EPD, and what is considered ordinary instruction? We also identified four levels of conflict, ranging from commognitive conflict that is implicit to the participants, to conflict that is made explicit and reflected upon. Finally, results show movement from implicit conflict towards explication of conflict during the two years of the PD.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Instruments designed to measure teachers’ knowledge for teaching mathematics have been widely used to evaluate the impact of professional development and to investigate the role of teachers’ knowledge in teaching and student learning. These instruments assess a mixture of content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. However, little attention has been given to the content alignment between such instruments and curricular standards, particularly in regard to how content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge items are distributed across mathematical topics. This article provides content maps for two widely used teacher assessment instruments in the USA relative to the widely adopted Common Core State Standards. This common reference enables comparisons of content alignment both between the instruments and between parallel forms within each instrument. The findings indicate that only a small number of items on both instruments are designed to capture teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge and that the majority of these items are focused on curricular topics in the later grades rather than in the early grades. Furthermore, some forms designed for use as pre- and post-assessment of professional development or teacher education are not parallel in terms of curricular topics, so estimates of teachers’ knowledge growth based on these forms may not mean what users assume. The implications of these findings for teacher educators and researchers who use teacher knowledge instruments are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Calculus courses have been attracting the attention of mathematics education researchers over the last decades. Recent publications and special issues dedicated to calculus highlight the diverse roles of calculus courses in the pathways for STEM studies within and across educational levels, as well as issues related to the academic preparation of future STEM professionals, including mathematicians, non-mathematics professionals (NMPs) and teachers. In this paper, we review recent literature, mostly since 2015, to identify and characterize explicit references to such diverse roles of calculus courses. The review highlights an intrinsic tension between two institutional roles of calculus: scaffolding and filtering. We find nuanced yet substantial variation in how the dual role of calculus is experienced and managed across different groups of students and stakeholders. With regard studies on calculus for mathematics students, recent studies attend to changes in the rules underpinning calculus notions and processes, and highlight the scaffolding potential of calculus courses towards abstraction and reasoning. In contrast, studies on calculus for NMPs report that such courses often promote filtering rather than scaffolding and question transferability and relevance of those courses for NMPs. Finally, studies challenge the perception that traditional tertiary calculus courses scaffold school teaching and underline the need for empirical research that would explain the nature of this scaffolding and how it can be realized in practice. We conclude that further empirical research, in particular theory development, is needed to address the diverse roles of calculus at the intersection of institutions, disciplines and communities.</p>
