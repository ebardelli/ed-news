  Abstract
                    <p>The lecture format, while being the subject of much criticism, is still one of the most common formats of university mathematics teaching. This paper investigates lecturing as a means of modelling mathematical discourse, sometimes highlighted in the literature as one of its most important functions. The data analysed in the paper are taken from first-semester lectures given by seven mathematics lecturers at three Swedish universities, all concerning various aspects of the function concept. Analysis was carried out from a commognitive perspective, which distinguishes between object-level and meta-level discourse. Here I focus on two aspects of meta-level discourse: introducing new mathematical objects; and what counts as valid endorsement of a narrative. The analysis reveals a number of metarules concerning the modelling of mathematical reasoning and behaviour, both more general rules such as precision and consensus, and rules more specifically concerning construction and endorsement of narratives. The paper contributes to a small but growing body of empirical research on university mathematics teaching, and also lends empirical support to previous claims about the modelling aspect of mathematics lecturing, thus contributing to a deepened understanding of the lecture format and its potential role in future university mathematics teaching.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Digital transformation has made possible the implementation of environments in which mathematics can be experienced in interplay with the computer. Examples are dynamic geometry environments or interactive computational environments, for example GeoGebra or Jupyter Notebook, respectively. We argue that a new possibility to construct and experience proofs arises alongside this development, as it enables the construction of environments capable of not only showing predefined animations, but actually allowing user interaction with mathematical objects and in this way supporting the construction of proofs. We precisely define such environments and call them “mathematical simulations.” Following a theoretical dissection of possible user interaction with these mathematical simulations, we categorize them in relation to other environments supporting the construction of mathematical proofs along the dimensions of “interactivity” and “formality.” Furthermore, we give an analysis of the functions of proofs that can be satisfied by simulation-based proofs. Finally, we provide examples of simulation-based proofs in Ariadne, a mathematical simulation for topology. The results of the analysis show that simulation-based proofs can in theory yield most functions of traditional symbolic proofs, showing promise for the consideration of simulation-based proofs as an alternative form of proof, as well as their use in this regard in education as well as in research. While a theoretical analysis can provide arguments for the possible functions of proof, they can fulfil their actual use and, in particular, their acceptance is of course subject to the sociomathematical norms of the respective communities and will be decided in the future.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>It has been suggested that students’ epistemic understandings influence their practice of argumentation. However, how that influence takes place is not yet fully explained. To contribute to the answer to this question, this study explored elementary students’ epistemic understandings in their scientific argumentation. A 4-month qualitative case study with descriptive and interpretive emphases was conducted in a grade 5/6 science classroom in Canada. Nineteen students and their teacher participated in this study. Multiple methods for data collection were employed, including observation, interviews, and collecting students’ works. It was found that these students were aware of their epistemic understandings. Qualitative data analysis also revealed that students’ epistemic understandings can, yet do not always, influence their performance in argumentation by affecting the ways they think and do while engaged in argumentative dialogues. Moreover, it was found that elementary students were capable of refining their epistemic understandings through social interactions with peers and adapting their epistemic understandings in new contexts. Based on the findings, instructional suggestions are discussed to support the development of students’ epistemic understandings and argumentation skills.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper investigates the phenomenon of compartmentalisation of knowledge in the teaching and learning of continuous probability distributions and integral calculus at the secondary-tertiary transition in France. Using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD), and in particular the key notion of praxeology, we investigate in which sense those two sectors may be described as compartmentalised in current textbooks. We then study, by means of a questionnaire, the educational effects of the compartmentalisation: do students’ difficulties in completing “bridging tasks” (tasks that require to relate the two sectors) reflect the partial disconnections revealed by the praxeological analyses? The key notion of ostensive, combined with the role played by the technology in the sense of ATD, is used to interpret the data. Altogether, this study sheds light on the deficit of cognitive flexibility required to change mathematical sectors, which is understood as a result of deficient praxeologies developed within the institutions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Computational thinking and activity are vital aspects of what it means to conduct scientific and mathematical work. In light of this, some propose that students’ mathematical education should include an integration of computing into their mathematical experiences, giving students opportunities to engage with computational tools as they reason about mathematical concepts. In this commentary, we make a case that the international RUME community should focus on studying the integration of computing in research in undergraduate mathematics education. We situate this discussion within existing literature. Then, we suggest ways in which researchers can incorporate ideas related to computing, and we propose ideas for how investigations into computing might practically be incorporated into our already-existing research foci. Ultimately, we hope to motivate other members of the RUME community to join us in what we consider to be a timely and exciting endeavor.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Engineering students particularly struggle with mathematics in the first year of their university studies. A result of these difficulties are high drop-out rates among the engineering students. There are various measures to support the students in their studies such as preparatory courses or bridging courses. The contribution of this research is to investigate the impact of certain factors on engineering students’ success in their first year of studies in a supportive environment which includes a preparatory course, tutorials, a bridging course and a drop-in centre. First, we ask how the students’ use of support measures impact the students’ success. Second, we clarify which affective, motivational and cognitive factors affect the students’ success in mathematics. Our further aim is to investigate the relationships between the factors that impact students’ success. We consider potential factors during the first year of studies. Our results suggest that particularly students’ mathematical abilities before the first semester and a support in tutorials during the first semester account for students’ success in the final exams in the first year of engineering studies.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Grow Your Own (GYO) programs are designed to recruit high school students, paraeducators, community organizers and parents, and/or career changers from the local community to join the educator workforce. When considering the nontraditional teacher pools that may enter the profession through GYO programs, commonly held assumptions about who teachers are, how they are developed, and what is most important for supporting their growth are challenged. This article reframes conventional narratives in teacher education by exploring the ways in which GYO programs offer counternarratives that reimagine teacher development by valuing (a) intersectional views of ethnoracial diversity, (b) resilience as an important teacher characteristic, (c) multiple modes of assessment as evidence of teacher learning, (d) ethnoracially diverse and community-based teacher educators, (e) culturally responsive pedagogy and place-based learning, and (f) local community school commitment.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper is a survey paper for the special issue on changes in Eastern European mathematics education in recent decades. In it I attempt to describe briefly the development of Eastern European mathematics education during the years that preceded the changes of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and to indicate certain questions for research pertaining to the subsequent period. Existing scientific literature about these topics is also discussed. One of the key problems that must inevitably be addressed is the problem of influence in mathematics education, which may be linked to quite varied political and organizational circumstances. The questions raised in the paper may be posed with respect to other countries as well, but in the countries of Eastern Europe, with their tumultuous and complex political history, the social aspect may be observed in greater relief than anywhere else. It is assumed that the analysis of general tendencies and patterns of development will be of interest even to a readership whose pursuits are otherwise far from Eastern Europe.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Video and coaching as vehicles for teachers’ professional development have both received much attention in educational research. The combination of the two, video coaching, where teachers watch and discuss videos of their own practice with a coach, seems especially promising, but there is limited insight into how the design leads to desired teacher and student outcomes through mediating enactment processes. This review systematically synthesized the occurrences and co-occurrences of video coaching design features, enactment processes, teacher outcomes, and student impacts as reported in 59 empirical studies. The literature corpus contained information on design features for all studies, but the video coaching enactment processes were described in only half of the studies. Altogether, the studies showed that video coaching can support some positive teacher outcomes, such as changes in pedagogical behavior, but evidence was not consistently reported for all types of outcomes. Few studies examined impacts on learners. Taken together, this review revealed important gaps in knowledge, which highlights the importance of paying attention to unpacking teacher learning processes.

  Abstract
                  <p>Over the last years, there is a growing interest in studying students’ difficulties with rational numbers from a cognitive/developmental perspective, focusing on the role of prior knowledge in students’ understanding of rational numbers. The present study tests the effect of the whole or natural number bias (i.e., the tendency to count on natural number knowledge to interpret information about rational numbers and deal with rational number tasks), on students’ expectations about the size (i.e., bigger or smaller) and the type (i.e., natural number or decimal) of the results of multiplication and division. Items that were congruent and incongruent with students’ assumed expectations were administered to 91 seventh and eighth graders, asking them to evaluate equalities presenting multiplication and division between given and missing numbers. The results showed that besides the already well-documented effect of the size of results (i.e., multiplication makes bigger and division makes smaller), students tended to think that the numbers involved in multiplication and division should be of the same type (i.e., natural or non-natural, e.g., decimals). Both size and type of the numbers involved in the operations were significant factors affecting students’ evaluations, with size being stronger than type.</p>

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 2, Page 49-53, October 2021. <br>For many schools and districts in the United States, Facebook has emerged as an important tool for sharing timely information, building a sense of community, highlighting staff and students, and many other purposes. However, neither researchers nor schools and districts have paid enough attention to how their Facebook use may pose a risk to the privacy of individuals — often students who are minors. Joshua Rosenberg, Macy Burchfield, Conrad Borchers, Benjamin Gibbons, Daniel Anderson, and Christian Fischer describe their recent studies showing that 15-20 million photos of students have been shared on publicly accessible Facebook pages of public schools and districts. They estimate that at least 150,000 of these photos — and perhaps as many as a million or more — depict students who are identifiable by name and school or district. They review some of the risks to students that might result from such social media posts and offer practical steps that schools and districts can take to minimize these risks.
