  Abstract
                  <p>This paper aims to explore the challenges that pre-service early childhood teachers (PECTs) face in the processes of planning and implementing STEM education–based activities and their solutions about these challenges. A total of 39 third-year pre-service teachers in İstanbul, Turkey, participated in the study, which lasted 14 weeks. The data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire and focus group interviews. The data were analyzed via qualitative approaches and codes and themes were determined. As a result of the analysis, five themes related to the planning of STEM education–based activities emerged: identifying the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, children’s development level, material selection, and STEM integration. Regarding the challenges the PECTs faced during the implementation process of STEM education–based activities, six themes emerged: expressing the problem, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, targeted instruction and implementations, children’s development level, time management, and classroom management. The analysis revealed 8 themes regarding the pre-service teachers’ solutions about successful planning and implementation of STEM education–based activities: materials to be used, group works conducted by the pre-service teachers, classroom arrangement and management, time management, appropriateness to children’s level, identifying and expressing the problem, activity planning and implementation, and implementing STEM education. This study is important because it will contribute to the implementation of STEM-based activities more in early childhood classes, as it identifies the challenges faced in the process of designing and implementing STEM-based activities as well as providing suggestions for the solution of these problems.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Mathematical modelling is endorsed as both a means and an end to learning mathematics. Despite its utility and inclusion as a curricular objective, one of many questions remaining about learners’ modelling regards how modelers choose relevant situational attributes and express mathematical relationships in terms of them. Research on quantitative reasoning has informed the field on how individuals quantify attributes and conceive of covariational relationships among them. However, this research has not often attended to modelers’ mathematization in open modelling tasks, an endeavor that invites further attention to theoretical and methodological details. To this end, we offer a synthesis of existing theories to present a cognitive account of mathematical model construction through a quantity-oriented lens. Second, we use empirical data to illustrate why it is productive for theories of modelling to attend to and account for students’ quantitative reasoning while modelling. Finally, we identify remaining challenges to coordinating different theoretical accounts of model construction.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper documents how the limit concept is treated in high school, at a university and in teacher education in England, France and Sweden. To this end we make use of vignettes, data-grounded accounts of the situation at the three levels in the three countries. These are analysed using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic (ATD). While university praxeologies are relatively similar across the three countries, greater differences manifest themselves in high school and teacher education. For instance, at the high school level, in France a local praxeology on the limits of sequences is taught, which is not the case in England or Sweden. Results from the analysis of limits are extrapolated to comment on implications for the teaching of calculus, and for teacher education, in the three countries. The paper also raises methodological issues in our approach.</p>

Using Perna’s seminal college-going model as a launching point, we propose a policy-driven empirical approach to explore how state and federal policy uniquely inform ever-EL students’ academic trajectories. This model considers how EL education policy is largely defined at the federal level but interpreted and implemented by state and local actors (i.e., the Lau and Castañeda cases). In addition, largely of immigrant origin, ever-EL students are directly affected by federal immigration policy as well as state immigrant policies. We suggest that the unique status of EL education in K-12 schools and the framing of immigrant-origin communities in federal and state policies make it necessary to consider both federal and state policy contexts in ever-EL college-going research.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Dramatic growth in the homeschool population in recent decades has coincided with an increase in the methods used to educate homeschooled children. However, researchers tend to treat homeschooled children as a uniform group without accounting for vastly different homeschooling arrangements. In this study, we examine the prevalence of four types of homeschool arrangements by pooling three cross-sectional waves of nationally representative data on American homeschool families (n = 1,468). Results indicate that most homeschool families supplement home education with cooperative instructors and private tutors, online education, and brick-and-mortar schooling. Families who do not use these resources are declining. They are also more likely to be White, less educated, and residing in the South region. Homeschool families whose children attend brick-and-mortar schools part-time are less likely to be White and more likely to reside in urban areas. Future research is needed to explore outcomes across different homeschool arrangements.

  Abstract
                  <p>In recent years, the use of personal electronic devices has become widespread in Canadian society, and many Canadian schools are adopting “bring your own device” policies. This exploratory research investigates the technological practices of middle years students with mathematics learning disabilities who use personal electronic devices to support their learning. Video-recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 participants in grades 6 and 8 at four schools in two western Canadian cities. Through grounded theory, themes related to the principles of the Universal Design for Learning emerged, suggesting that participants’ practices with their personal electronic devices indeed helped them to access text content, and express their knowledge and understanding related to school mathematics. This study identifies some learner-driven practices, providing a stronger voice to students with mathematics learning disabilities in suggesting better ways to make use of everyday technology as a learning support.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Internships are widely viewed as “door openers” to opportunity, yet students without ample financial, social, and institutional supports are often excluded from these experiences. This exclusion is especially problematic for Latinx students attending Hispanic-Serving Institutions, for whom an internship could be transformative. In this article, we elaborate upon Núñez’s (2014) multilevel model of intersectionality to highlight how agents’ perceptions, social categories, embodied practices, and broader contextual forces interrelate to shape Latinx students’ access to internship opportunities at a university in the border region of Texas. Using inductive thematic, correlational, and social-network analysis techniques to analyze survey (n = 192) and focus group (n = 12) data, we find that gender, academic major, socioeconomic status, and race intersect with organizational (e.g., insufficient information) and contextual (e.g., labor markets) factors to shape students’ access and perceptions. We provide recommendations for disrupting systemic inequalities in internship access and culturally appropriate programming and ideas for future research.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>We examined how performance-based funding (PBF) for higher education institutions in Tennessee, Ohio, and Indiana affects bachelor’s degree completion, admission practices, and the enrollment of underserved students. Utilizing data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, we employed an event study analysis, in addition to a canonical difference-in-differences and coarsened exact matching strategy. The event study results revealed no effect in Tennessee, whereas bachelor’s degree completion may have a delayed positive effect in Ohio and Indiana. Interestingly, Indiana institutions funded based on performance increased their institutional selectivity immediately after the funding was enacted, whereas underrepresented students’ enrollment results differed among subgroups across states. We conclude by offering a critical review of the policy regimes and recommending fruitful areas for future research.

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>Reclassification can be an important juncture in the academic experience of English Learners (ELs). Literature has explored the potential for reclassification to influence academic outcomes like achievement, yet its impact on social-emotional learning (SEL) skills, which are as malleable and important to long-term success, remains unclear. Using a regression discontinuity design, we examine the causal effect of reclassification on SEL skills (self-efficacy, growth mindset, self-management, and social awareness) among 4th to 8th graders. In the districts studied, reclassification improved academic self-efficacy by 0.2 standard deviations for students near the threshold. Results are robust to alternative specifications and analyses. Given this evidence, we discuss ways districts might establish practices that instill more positive academic beliefs among ELs.

  Abstract
                  <p>Research using the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic suggests different models of how student learning may evolve in the progression of undergraduate mathematics coursework: from elementary courses in Calculus to more advanced courses in Analysis. An ideal model suggests that the theory-driven learning in the latter serves as a natural complement and extension to the primarily procedural focus of the former. A contrasting model points to a potential didactic obstacle to the ideal evolution of students’ knowledge: When the types of tasks in Analysis courses (e.g., “prove a specified limit”) resemble those in Calculus courses (e.g., “find a specified limit”). To gain insight into the actual evolution experienced by students, we contributed an exploratory study of one introductory Analysis course, including an analysis of assessment activities provided in the course and task-based interviews with 15 students shortly after they passed the course. Results suggest that when faced with “Analysis tasks” that look like “Calculus tasks,” most students do not mobilize the proof-based knowledge that was expected to be learned in Analysis. Moreover, this could be linked not only to the non-empty intersection of students’ Calculus and Analysis courses, but also to the place of Calculus and Analysis in the intersection of their differing future professional institutions.</p>

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This meta-analysis examines the effects of sorting secondary students into different tracks (“between-school” tracking) or classrooms (“within-school” tracking) on the efficiency and inequality levels of an educational system. Efficiency is related to the overall learning achievement of students, whereas inequality can refer to “inequality of achievement” (i.e., the dispersion of outcomes) or “inequality of opportunity” (i.e., the strength of the influence of family background on student achievement). The selected publications are 53 analyses performed in the period from 2000 to 2021, yielding 213 estimates on efficiency and 230 estimates on inequality. The results show that the mean effect size (Hedge’s G) of tracking on efficiency is not statistically significant (G = −.063), whereas it is significantly positive (G = .117) on inequality. We further set out to explain variation in effect sizes by (a) policy characteristics, (b) the operationalization of main variables, (c) the research design, (d) the set of control variables included in the statistical analyses, and (e) the quality of the study, year of publication, and publication status (peer reviewed or not peer reviewed).

  Abstract
                  <p>Learning progressions have become increasingly prevalent in mathematics education as they offer a fine-grain map of possible learning pathways a child may take within a particular domain. However, there is an opportunity to build upon this research in ways that consider learning from multiple perspectives. Many current forms of learning progressions describe learning pathways without explicit consideration of how related skills and contexts directly or indirectly enhance or influence learning. That is, the structured and unstructured learning contexts that can help children develop conceptual understanding in a range of STEM contexts. We consider learning progressions from multiple perspectives, which will be particularly important for supporting learning in early years, play-based contexts. We propose a novel theoretical perspective, termed Bounded Learning Progressions (BLP), which demonstrates the connection and influence ways of reasoning have on the progression of learning in specific domains, bounded by the context in which learning develops. We suggest that this approach provides a broader perspective of children’s learning capabilities and the possible connections between such abilities, acknowledging the critical role context plays in the development of learning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Of the many disciplines that rely on calculus, physics is among those with the strongest connections to this branch of mathematics. For instance, the derivative—one of the key notions of calculus—is used to describe velocity and acceleration, which play a central role in mechanics. In post-secondary education, in particular at the college level, it is not unusual for students to enroll in calculus and mechanics courses in the same year, and even the same term. In mathematics education, however, there is scant research focusing on students’ construction of the notion of derivative in a mechanics context, and existing studies offer contradictory views on the effectiveness of using mechanics to teach derivatives. To shed light on the use of derivatives in mechanics and calculus courses, our study focuses on practices involving the use of derivatives to study motion in both courses. We first conducted a praxeological analysis of five differential calculus textbooks and five mechanics textbooks to pinpoint their use of derivatives in the study of motion. This analysis was complemented by interviews with four mathematics teachers and three mechanics teachers, to compare their praxeologies with those of the textbooks. We then identified consistencies and inconsistencies between practices employed in both courses, which may have an impact on students’ learning, and formulated recommendations for teaching the notion of derivative in kinematics.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Educational policy research on teacher unionization in the United States has been dominated by two theoretical perspectives: rent-seeking and teacher voice. While bringing valuable insights to bear, these views have mutated into rigid and often ideologically charged alternatives with strong normative claims about teacher collective bargaining. Drawing from a political economy framework, this article advances a distinct theoretical perspective focusing on the progressive coalition building activities of teachers’ unions (i.e., organizing and mobilizing to promote the interests of working people in policymaking). This perspective resolves previous theoretical anomalies of union behavior; provides many new avenues for research; and highlights distinct considerations for the practice of teacher organizing.

  Abstract
                  <p>The most recent revision and rewriting of the natural sciences program was a rather turbulent process. The 2018 version of the program was the subject of a number of critiques, to the point that the minister at the time had to convene a panel of experts to resolve the issue. In an article published in winter 2021, Désautels did a political analysis of the revision process and blamed power games for the direction the program ended up taking. He also critiqued the program itself, identifying certain shortcomings that had been pointed out 20 years earlier. In this article, we revisit some of the issues that Désautels raised. Specifically, we look at disciplinary conservatism, the universality of the program, the non-problematization of science teaching and the program’s scientistic nature. While Désautels’ criticism of the process and its result were fairly incisive, here we not only recognize the significance of the points he raised but also attempt to comprehend why the program reverted to a structure similar to its predecessor despite numerous comments and perspectives that advocated for better learning integration. A more open process akin to the one presented in 2018 could have improved such integration, but the pervading conservatism of the time prevented it. The article ends with an enduring and pervasive rift between the world of education research and that of practitioners.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>A growing movement suggests that social and emotional learning (SEL) should be integrated into educational experiences in and outside schools. Afterschool programs can be particularly well suited for SEL, and afterschool educators can play an important role in skill development. We interviewed 23 experienced afterschool educators in community-based programs to understand how staff encourage SEL and how program directors support staff in doing so. Findings show that afterschool educators describe integrating SEL into their daily interactions with children by creating and catching teachable moments. Program directors served either as compliance enforcers or partners who supported staff’s autonomy to encourage SEL despite top-down mandates. Findings suggest that educators can develop substantial expertise integrating SEL into their professional work. By recognizing and empowering such expertise, program leaders can support implementation and innovation of SEL practices. Allocating resources toward intentional integration of SEL is an important next step for this work.

This study uses district-level panel data from Oklahoma and a difference-in-differences research design to provide estimates of the causal effect of the 4-day school week on high school students’ ACT scores, attendance, and disciplinary incidents during school. Results indicate that 4-day school weeks decrease per-pupil bullying incidents by approximately 39% and per-pupil fighting incidents by approximately 31%, but have no detectable effect on other incident types, ACT scores, or attendance.

  Abstract
                  <p>Isomorphism and homomorphism are topics central to abstract algebra, but research on mathematicians’ views of these topics, especially with respect to sameness, remains limited. This study examines open response survey data from 197 mathematicians on how sameness could be helpful or harmful when studying isomorphism and homomorphism. Using thematic analysis, we examined whether sameness was viewed as helpful or harmful for isomorphism and homomorphism before examining rationales for those views. Making use of values of the mathematical community, we note that mathematicians saw conceptual and pedagogical benefits to connecting isomorphism and sameness, which connects to leveraging intuition and valuing ways of increasing understanding. Mathematicians’ concerns around using sameness largely revolved around the violation of the mathematical community’s idealized value of expressing a priori truth via a-contextual justifications. However, these concerns can be addressed through only targeted usage of sameness and explicit discussions around the utility and relevance of sameness. Implications include the importance of considering how interventions proposed by mathematics educators align with or provoke tension between values held by the mathematical community in order to mitigate or lean into those tensions and encourage fruitful dialogue between the mathematics and mathematics education communities.</p>
