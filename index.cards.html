  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>One of the primary goals of international large-scale assessments in education is the comparison of country means in student achievement. This article introduces a framework for discussing differential item functioning (DIF) for such mean comparisons. We compare three different linking methods: concurrent scaling based on full invariance, concurrent scaling based on partial invariance using the RMSD statistic, and robust and nonrobust linking approaches based on separate scaling. Furthermore, we analytically derive the bias in the country means of different linking methods in the presence of DIF. In a simulation study, we show that the partial invariance and robust linking approaches provide less biased country means than the full invariance approach in the case of biased items.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Freshman seminars are a ubiquitous offering in higher education, but they have not been evaluated using matched comparisons with data at scale. In this work, we use transcript data on over 76,000 students to examine the impact of first-year interest groups (FIGs) on student graduation and retention. We first apply propensity score matching on course-level data to account for selection bias. We find that graduation and re-enrollment rates for FIG students were higher than non-FIG students, an effect that was more pronounced for self-identified underrepresented racial minority students. We then employ topic modeling to analyze survey responses from over 12,500 FIG students to find that social aspects of FIGs were most beneficial to students. Interestingly, references to social aspects were not disproportionately present in the responses of self-identified underrepresented racial minority students.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Mathematics teacher coaching is a promising but largely overlooked form of professional development (PD) for supporting mathematics teachers’ learning of justice-oriented teaching. In this article, we critically review the literature to illuminate what we currently know about mathematics teacher coaching and to highlight studies’ contributions and limitations to inform future work. Broadly, we find that four programs of research have developed, investigating: (a) coaches’ activities and relationships, (b) the effects of coaching on student assessment scores, (c) the effects of coaching on teachers’ practices or behaviors, and (d) the effects of coaching on teachers’ knowledge or beliefs. From this analysis, we argue that justice-oriented perspectives of teaching, in tandem with sociocultural theories of teachers’ learning, could allow for more nuanced investigations of coaching and could support design of learning experiences for teachers that bring us closer to educational justice.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the context of early algebra research and as part of a classroom teaching experiment (CTE), we investigated fourth grade (9- to 10-year-old) students’ justifications of how they performed tasks involving the functional relationship y = 2x. We related their written justifications (part of the task) to the task characteristics, which included various semiotic systems (verbal, numerical and alphanumeric, among others) and the demand of different type of justifications. The role of classroom discussion in helping express the functional relationship orally in more sophisticated terms was also investigated. The findings showed that students’ written justifications changed with the semiotic system involved in the task. Oral discussion helped students generalize in more sophisticated terms than in their written justifications, in which they omitted information or used less precise language.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>With this article, we aim to spur a conversation on research implementation in the context of collaborations of mathematics teachers and educational researchers, with a special interest in projects situated in university mathematics education. Implementation has been often discussed in relation to the education of school teachers, and we suggest that the conceptual, theoretical, and analytical apparatus that has been developed in this research area can be re-purposed to study implementation. Specifically, we propose that in collaborative projects, implementation can be construed as an interactive change-oriented process, in which teachers and researchers develop their praxeologies through interaction and joint work on boundary objects. We illustrate the usefulness of this proposal with a teacher-mathematician and a mathematics education researcher who joined forces to introduce scriptwriting activities into an undergraduate mathematics course. Drawing on the theoretical analysis and illustration, we make suggestions for future implementation studies in the context of teacher-researcher collaborations.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Recent developments in cognitive and educational science highlight the role of the body in learning. Novel digital technologies increasingly facilitate bodily interaction. Aiming for understanding of the body’s role in learning mathematics with technology, we reconsider the instrumental approach from a radical embodied cognitive science perspective. We highlight the complexity of any action regulation, which is performed by a complex dynamic functional system of the body and brain in perception-action loops driven by multilevel intentionality. Unlike mental schemes, functional systems are decentralized and can be extended by artifacts. We introduce the notion of a body-artifact functional system, pointing to the fact that artifacts are included in the perception-action loops of instrumented actions. The theoretical statements of this radical embodied reconsideration of the instrumental approach are illustrated by an empirical example, in which embodied activities led a student to the development of instrumented actions with a unit circle as an instrument to construct a sine graph. Supplementing videography of the student’s embodied actions and gestures with eye-tracking data, we show how new functional systems can be formed. Educational means to facilitate the development of body-artifact functional systems are discussed.</p>

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Nontraditional teacher preparation pathways were designed to offer different forms of preparation meant to attract different populations of teachers; however, prior literature suggests they may not provide as much of an alternative as initially intended. Drawing on surveys of nearly 800 preservice student teachers and their mentor teachers, we offer a descriptive overview comparing traditional, alternative, and residency pathways preparing teachers in Chicago Public Schools. Our study provides evidence that nontraditional forms of teacher preparation in Chicago do indeed provide unique routes of entry into the profession. We find substantive differences in the kinds of preparation that these pathways offer, including features of preparation such as program and student teaching duration and methods course load, which are often assumed to differ. We also find differences in features not historically studied including mentor characteristics and experiences, types of mentoring provided, and supports received by mentors.

  Abstract
                  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation that influenced all aspects of society, including education. Millions of students found themselves adjusting to a new medium of mathematics instruction, not to mention the teachers who had to provide instruction through remote sources. Considering students’ diverse social, economic, and academic background, this study sought to examine teachers’ perspectives on factors that support or hinder how equity is attended to in mathematics during remote instruction and the extent it differed from practices utilized when instruction was provided in a face-to-face setting. We also sought to document teachers’ perspectives on how they attended to equity in mathematics to support students with language barriers. We interviewed nine teachers to explore their perspectives of factors that support or hinder equity in mathematics teaching and learning during remote instruction compared to face-to-face instruction and how they support the diverse needs (inclusive of language barriers) of students. There were salient factors in this study that supported or hindered equitable mathematics instruction, such as teachers’ beliefs, expectations for students, access to resources, students’ socioeconomic status, and language barriers. Hence, it is recommended that policymakers, school administrators, and teachers need to collaborate to systematically plan to ensure that all students have access to quality mathematics.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article offers a framework for analyzing social movement participation in public education through a focus on universities in Brazil. It builds on the literature on social movement–state relations, participatory governance, and community organizing in schools, drawing on the case of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement and the National Program for Education in Areas of Agrarian Reform (PRONERA) to illustrate the need to recenter the idea of conflict as a central and ongoing process of social movement participation in public schools and universities. The article also introduces the concept of prefiguration and highlights how students can prefigure in the formal public school system the types of social and economic practices they hope to build in the future. Contentious cogovernance and prefiguration are tools not only for improving educational equity but also for increasing the strength and internal capacity of social movements, paralleling the role Paulo Freire envisioned for nonformal popular education within grassroots organizations.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study examines the collective mathematical reasoning when students and teachers in grades 3, 4, and 5 explore fractions derived from length comparisons, in a task inspired by the El´konin and Davydov curriculum. The analysis showed that the mathematical reasoning was mainly anchored in mathematical properties related to fractional or algebraic thinking. Further analysis showed that these arguments were characterised by interplay between fractional and algebraic thinking except in the conclusion stage. In the conclusion and the evaluative arguments, these two types of thinking appeared to be intertwined. Another result is the discovery of a new type of argument, identifying arguments, which deals with the first step in task solving. Here, the different types of arguments, including the identifying arguments, were not initiated only by the teachers but also by the students. This in a multilingual classroom with a large proportion of students newly arrived. Compared to earlier research, this study offers a more detailed analysis of algebraic and fractional thinking including possible patterns within the collective mathematical reasoning. An implication of this is that algebraic and fractional thinking appear to be more intertwined than previous suggested.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Feedback provided by mathematics teachers usually addresses procedural skills and, to a much lesser extent, other competencies such as conceptual understanding or engagement in mathematical practices. As most previous literature has studied feedback provided on homework or video prompts, how teachers provide such feedback in the classroom is poorly understood. Here, sixteen lessons taught by five teachers were purposefully sampled from a larger video study (172 lessons) as lessons with high-quality feedback according to a standardized observation instrument. The analysis focused on the instructional situations in which teachers provided feedback. When teachers provided procedural feedback, the situations were orderly and effective. Feedback on conceptual understanding and mathematical practices was provided in situations when students were especially challenged, and entailed a series of complex decisions, thereby placing demands on the teachers to manage both the students’ understanding and behavior. We argue that researchers should focus on how teachers and students negotiate the instructional situation to allow for feedback on conceptual understanding or mathematical practices.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>International comparative studies on mathematics teaching and learning often provide unitary and harmonious images of classroom practices. This paper aims to complement those studies by describing the complex aspects of those practices. Adopting activity theory as a framework, this paper considers classroom teaching and learning of mathematics as an activity system embedded in socio-historical contexts, analyzes its contradictions, and makes a comparative analysis of different practices of mathematics teaching and learning in the same country. As a case in point, mathematics lessons in Japanese secondary schools are considered. The initial activity system of mathematics lessons in Japanese modern schools came from the whole-class instruction system and then gradually evolved into the problem-solving style lesson. The latter has been facing challenges, and then a new activity system has emerged from a new paradigm of school education. It is argued that activity systems analysis enables us to understand the contradictions prevailing in mathematics education and that comparative analysis of more than one system in the same culture can provide valuable insights.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>The presence of clustered data is common in the sociobehavioral sciences. One approach that specifically deals with clustered data but has seen little use in education is the generalized estimating equations (GEEs) approach. We provide a background on GEEs, discuss why it is appropriate for the analysis of clustered data, and provide worked examples using both continuous and binary outcomes. Comparisons are made between GEEs, multilevel models, and ordinary least squares results to highlight similarities and differences between the approaches. Detailed walkthroughs are provided using both R and SPSS Version 26.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>In this study, dormitory room and social group assignment data from a college are used to investigate peer effects on college students’ decisions to switch majors. Results reveal strong evidence of such peer effects at both the room and the social group level. Most notably, at the room level, the dense concentration of same-major roommates deters students from switching majors; having one or two same-major roommates has no significant effect on major switching, indicating strong nonlinearity of peer effects at the room level. Such nonlinearity is not observed among social group members. Results also reveal evidence that students’ choices of new majors are affected by peers’ majors. Peers are more likely to choose the same destination majors than nonpeers. In choosing their new majors, students do not necessarily follow their peers indiscriminately. Their decisions seem to be influenced more by short-term academic requirements than by long-term job prospects. Finally, peer effects on major switching and major choices are stronger at the dormitory room level than at the social group level in most cases.

  Abstract
                  <p>This paper utilizes poststructural theory to analyze student artifacts that were collected from a history of mathematics course. The course was designed to counter three types of mathematical narratives, relating to: 1) race, 2) intelligence, and 3) innateness. To address these narratives, the course highlighted the contributions of communities of color and other minoritized populations in the historical development of mathematics. It also explicitly challenged dominant constructions of mathematical history and problematized their use to further the power and privilege of particular groups. Analyses of student artifacts showed that this course provided space for students to defy innate intelligence racial narratives and strengthen their own counter-stories.</p>
