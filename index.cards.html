  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 269-292, June 2022. <br>Commonly used unit-root tests in time-series analysis—such as the Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron tests—use a null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root. Such tests have low power against the alternative—when a time series is near integrated or highly autoregressive—implying that they do poorly in distinguishing such a series from having a unit root. Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, Journal of Econometrics 54: 159–178) introduced the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test, in which the null hypothesis is that the series is stationary, to deal with this problem. One shortcoming of the presently available Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test in Stata is that it uses asymptotic critical values regardless of the sample size. This poses a problem in that researchers—especially social scientists—are often presented with short time series. I introduce kpsstest, a command that extends the previous implementation by including an option for a zero-mean-stationary null hypothesis, generating sample and test-specific critical values, and reporting appropriate p-values.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 416-429, June 2022. <br>In statistical work, it is essential to have an overview of the data used. In, for example, biomedical articles, a standardized way of reporting summaries of continuous and categorical variables is “table 1”. This standardized way of reporting can be useful in most cases of statistical work. The basetable command is a flexible and straightforward way to build and format such table reports. The final reports are easy to style into Stata Markup and Control Language, commaseparated values, HyperText Markup Language, LATEX or TEX, or Markdown and, for example, save into a file specified by the using modifier. Also, it is possible to export the reports created by basetable into Excel worksheets. Because of the General Data Protection Regulation, it has become necessary to blur information on individuals when making reports; in basetable, there are options to blur both categorical and continuous data.

However, in the presence of noncompliance, this can often lead to biased estimates because intention-to-treat analysis completely ignores varying levels of actual treatment received. This is a known issue that can be overcome by adopting the complier average causal effect approach, which estimates the effect the trial had on the individuals who complied with the protocol. When compliance is unobserved in the control group, the complier average causal effect estimate can be obtained via a latent class specification using the gsem command.

The sivqr command offers several advantages over the existing ivqreg and ivqreg2 commands for estimating this instrumental variables quantile regression model, which complements the alternative “triangular model” behind cqiv and the “local quantile treatment effect” model of ivqte. Computationally, sivqr implements the smoothed estimator of Kaplan and Sun (2017, Econometric Theory 33: 105–157), who show that smoothing improves both computation time and statistical accuracy. Standard errors are computed analytically or by Bayesian bootstrap; for nonindependent and identically distributed sampling, sivqr is compatible with bootstrap. I discuss syntax and the underlying methodology, and I compare sivqr with other commands in an example.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>The absence of federal support leaves undocumented students reliant on state policies to financially support their postsecondary education. We descriptively examine the postsecondary trajectories of tens of thousands of undocumented students newly eligible for California’s state-aid program, using detailed application data to compare them to similar peers. In this context, undocumented students who apply and are eligible for the program use grant aid to attend college at rates similar to their peers. Undocumented students remain more likely to enroll in a community college rather than attend a broad-access 4-year college and have higher exit rates from 2-year colleges. However, undocumented students are equally likely to attend the more selective University of California system and across 4-year public colleges have persistence rates similar to their peers, showing that those who do attend 4-year colleges perform well.

  Abstract
                    <p>This article reports on a second national survey of higher education institutions in the USA to answer the question “Who teaches mathematics content courses for prospective elementary teachers, and what are these instructors’ academic and teaching backgrounds?” and addresses valuable information not collected with the first survey conducted in 2010. We surveyed 1740 institutions and a faculty member from each of 413 institutions (23.7%) participated in the survey. The survey results demonstrate that the majority of these institutions are not meeting the recommendations of the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences (2012) and the Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators (2017) for prospective elementary teachers to take at least 12 semester-hour credits of mathematics content designed specifically for them. The data do indicate that there is movement toward more activity-based approaches for these courses as compared to the 2010 survey. Additionally, there is an increase in these courses having instructors with doctorates in mathematics education as well as an increase in instructors having grades 7–12 teaching experience. Most instructors for these courses do not have elementary teaching experience and have likely not had opportunities to think deeply about the important ideas in elementary mathematics. While most institutions still do not provide training and/or support for these instructors, formalized support and training appear to be increasing since the 2010 survey.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Pedagogical beliefs are a critical factor in terms of integrating technology into teaching, but very few technology acceptance models (TAMs) have considered them. Hence, this study aims to extend the TAM by incorporating pre-service teachers’ conception of teaching and learning. The revised model examined the influence of pre-service mathematics teachers’ constructivist and traditional pedagogical beliefs on their technology acceptance through perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward technology, and behavioral intention to use. Survey data were collected from 714 pre-service mathematics teachers in Turkey and analyzed through path analysis. The results showed that pre-service mathematics teachers’ pedagogical beliefs were more constructivist-oriented than traditional-oriented, and constructivist beliefs had a significant influence on the components of the TAM. On the other hand, pre-service teachers’ traditional-oriented beliefs did not influence their perceived usefulness of and attitudes toward technology but had positive effects on perceived ease of use. Implications for pre-service mathematics teacher education were discussed.</p>

The first command allows a user to test whether consumer expenditure data satisfy several revealed preference axioms; the second command calculates measures of goodness of fit when the data violate these axioms; and the third command calculates power against uniformly random behavior as well as predictive success for each axiom. We illustrate the commands using individual-level experimental data and household-level aggregate consumption data.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 293-318, June 2022. <br>Starting from version 15, Stata allows users to manage data and fit regressions accounting for spatial relationships through the sp commands. Spatial regressions can be estimated using the spregress, spxtregress, and spivregress  commands. These commands allow users to fit spatial autoregressive models in cross-sectional and panel data. However, they are designed to estimate regressions with continuous dependent variables. Although binary spatial regressions are important in applied econometrics, they cannot be estimated in Stata. Therefore, I introduce spatbinary, a Stata command that allows users to fit spatial logit and probit models.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 430-445, June 2022. <br>I introduce binscatterhist, a command that extends the functionality of the popular binscatter command (Stepner, 2013, Statistical Software Components S457709, Department of Economics, Boston College). binscatter allows researchers to summarize the relationship between two variables in an informative and versatile way by collapsing scattered points into bins. However, information about the variables’ frequencies gets lost in the process. binscatterhist solves this issue by allowing the user to further enrich the graphs by plotting the variables’ underlying distribution. The binscatterhist command includes options for different regression methods, including reghdfe (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College) and areg, and robust and clustered standard errors, with automatic reporting of estimation results and sample size.

This command produces estimates, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals for the average treatment effect. The utility of the command is demonstrated with both simulated and real data of right heart catheterization. These illustrations show that the proposed estimator implemented by the robustate command indeed exhibits more robustness against limited overlap than the traditional inverse-probability weighting estimator. The main method of the command is proposed in Sasaki and Ura (2022, Econometric Theory 38: 66–112).

I provide examples to illustrate cases where uirt can be especially useful in conducting analyses within the item response theory approach.

Average math test scores in the fall of 2021 in Grades 3–8 were .20–.27 standard deviation (SD) lower relative to same-grade peers in the fall of 2019, while reading test scores decreased by .09–.18 SD. Achievement gaps between students in low-poverty and high-poverty elementary schools grew by .10–.20 SD, primarily during the 2020–2021 school year. Achievement disparities by student race/ethnicity also widened substantively. Observed declines are more substantial than during other recent school disruptions, such as those due to natural disasters.

  Abstract
                    <p>To better understand the critical early years of teaching and teacher identity development, this study explored the mathematics teacher identity of two early career middle school mathematics teachers and the influence of their working communities on its development. Emel and Berk graduated from the same reform-oriented teacher education program and were working in fundamentally different working communities that could be characterized as reform-unsupportive (Emel) and reform-supportive (Berk). They were interviewed three times and were observed extensively in their working communities. Findings revealed two different teacher identities: Emel exhibited a mathematics teacher identity that was more reform-oriented than non-reform-oriented, and Berk exhibited a non-reform-oriented mathematics teacher identity. Their working communities had influenced their mathematics teacher identity in ways that were both theoretically expected (positive effects of supportive conditions and negative effects of unsupportive conditions) and surprising (positive effects of negative conditions and no effects of positive conditions). The findings are discussed in detail with implications for teacher education programs and supports for early career teachers.

  Abstract
                    <p>Studies of facilitators of professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers have been increasing in order to improve their preparation for conducting PD. However, specifications of what facilitators should learn often lack a conceptualization that captures facilitators’ expertise for different PD content. In this article, we provide a framework for facilitator expertise that is in line with current conceptualizations but makes explicit the content-related aspects of such expertise. The framework for content-related facilitator expertise combines cognitive and situated perspectives and allows unpacking different components at the PD level and the classroom level. Using two illustrative cases of different PD content (probability education in primary school and language-responsive mathematics teaching in secondary school), we exemplify how the framework can help to analyze facilitators’ practices in content-related ways in a descriptive mode. This analysis reveals valuable insights that support designers of facilitator preparation programs to specify what facilitators should learn in a prescriptive mode. We particularly emphasize the importance of working on content-related aspects, unpacking the PD content goals into the content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge elements on the classroom level and developing facilitators’ pedagogical content knowledge on the PD level (PCK-PD), which includes curricular knowledge, as well as knowledge about teachers’ typical thinking about a specific PD content. Situated learning opportunities in facilitator preparation programs can support facilitators to activate these knowledge elements for managing typical situational demands in PD.</p>
