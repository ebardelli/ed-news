  Abstract
                  <p>Modelling competencies are currently included in numerous curricula worldwide and are generally accepted as a complex, process-oriented construct. Therefore, effective measurement should include multiple dimensions, like the sub-competencies required throughout the modelling process. Departing from the characteristics of modelling problems as open and often underdetermined real-world problems, we propose to enrich the current conceptualisation of mathematical modelling competencies by including creativity, which plays an important role in numerous phases of the mathematical modelling process but has scarcely been considered in modelling discourse. In the study described in this paper, a new instrument for the evaluation of this enriched construct has been developed and implemented. The modelling competencies incorporating creativity of the students were evaluated based on the adequacy of the models and the modelling processes proposed, and the appropriateness and completeness of the approaches were evaluated in detail. Adapting measurement approaches for creativity that have been developed in the problem-solving discourse, certain criteria of creativity were selected to evaluate the creativity of the students’ approaches in tackling modelling problems—namely, usefulness, fluency, and originality. The empirical study was conducted among 107 Chinese students at the upper secondary school level, who attended a modelling camp and independently solved three complex modelling problems. The results reveal significant correlations between fluency and originality in students’ performances across all tasks; however, the relationships between usefulness and the other two creativity aspects were not consistent. Overall, the results of the study support the importance of the inclusion of creativity in the construct of modelling competencies.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Research has shown that students’ beliefs related to mathematics are connected to their affect and motivation as well as their mathematical thinking and activity. Moreover, high parental expectations have been shown to play a role in students’ positive beliefs and self-efficacy. This paper reports on two studies investigating parental expectations related to students’ beliefs and their perceived achievement. These studies highlighted an unusual, but confirmed finding that students who do not perceive that their parents have specific mathematics achievement expectations show more positive mathematics-related beliefs and higher perceived mathematics achievement than students who believe their parents do have specific expectations. This paper explores possible reasons for this finding related to parents’ methods of conveying their expectations.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>This article explores the development of a guidance document titled the “Framework for Equitable Instruction” (Framework), which aims to support multilingual students’ content-area learning and language development. The Framework was developed by WIDA, a national consortium of states, as part of its system of language standards, assessments, and professional learning. The article discusses the Framework using a protocol originally created for the alignment of content-area and language standards. The protocol highlights the rigorous theoretical foundations of the Framework, the research-based rationale behind its conceptualization of language trajectories, and the tight linkages between the Framework, content-area standards, and classroom instruction. The systematic exploration of the Framework’s features in this article can inform the future design of language standards and related documents and serve as a foundation for the constructive critique of existing ones.

  Abstract
                  <p>The aim of the paper is to show whether the systems of mathematics teacher education in two countries whose historical development may seem quite similar (the Czech Republic and Hungary were parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, and they were part of the Eastern European communist block) are also very similar, or whether each country follows its own, unique path. In this paper we build on the general need for more international comparative studies in the area of teacher education. We present a historical review of development of mathematics teacher education in both countries and analyse and compare current teacher education programs, their structure and organization, the demands on mathematics teachers and their qualifications for teaching at various levels. In the paper we pinpoint a number of aspects resulting in differences in the two systems, including historical development and traditions, (de)-centralization, globalization and international cooperation, etc. The comparison based on these aspects shows that the systems in both countries are very different. The analysis described in this paper could become the starting point for further research using the data from international surveys (e.g. PISA). Such research would enable us to make conjectures about the effects of various ways of organizing teacher education.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>System-wide educational reforms are difficult to implement in the United States, but despite the difficulties, reforms can be successful, particularly when they are associated with broad public support. This study reports on the nature of the public sentiment expressed about a nationwide science education reform effort, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Through the use of data science techniques to measure the sentiment of posts on Twitter about the NGSS (N = 565,283), we found that public sentiment about the NGSS is positive, with only 11 negative posts for every 100 positive posts. In contrast to findings from past research and public opinion polling on the Common Core State Standards, sentiment about the NGSS has become more positive over time—and was especially positive for teachers. We discuss what this positive sentiment may indicate about the success of the NGSS in light of opposition to the Common Core State Standards.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, I report the results of a study of a large-scale implementation of an evidence-based, objective-oriented approach to teaching via digital platforms among mathematics teachers in Denmark. The aim of the study was to investigate how these platforms affect the work of mathematics teachers and how emergent problems in this process can be addressed from an implementation perspective. This objective was achieved by applying concepts from the theory of instrumental genesis to analyze ethnographical data of teachers’ platform usage and data from participatory workshops. The results of the study indicate that the design of platforms is likely to conflict with the needs of mathematics teachers and thus I argue for the need of addressing such issues by supporting teachers in enacting innovations rather than by redesigning them. Furthermore, in the paper I suggest that future workshop is an adequate format to support such enactments.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper we discuss students’ opportunities to learn to pose mathematical problems, based on a historical analysis of problem posing in the area of number and algebra in six series of Chinese primary school mathematics textbooks published since the 1950s. We examine changes in the proportion and distribution of the problem-posing tasks, and in the presentation of the problem-posing tasks. Our results show a decreasing number of problem-posing tasks as grade level increases, even though problem posing has become more important in mathematics education in China during the last 70 years. This study also provides a variety of examples of problem-posing tasks which could serve as a reference for teachers in other countries in designing and employing problem-posing tasks in the classroom.</p>
