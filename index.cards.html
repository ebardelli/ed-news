  Abstract
                  <p>Several studies have shown that children do not only erroneously use additive reasoning in proportional word problems, but also erroneously use proportional reasoning in additive word problems. Traditionally, these errors were contributed to a lack of calculation and discrimination skills. Recent research evidence puts forward an additional explanation, namely, children’s relational preference (i.e., in tasks where both, additive and multiplicative reasoning, are appropriate, some children have a preference for additive relations, while others have a preference for multiplicative relations). Children’s relational preference offers a unique explanation for erroneous word-problem solving, after taking into account computation and discrimination skills in 8- to 12-year-olds. However, it is still unclear whether relational preference is also associated with word-problem solving at an earlier age, before the start of formal instruction in word-problem solving. A task measuring children’s relational preference as well as three additive and three proportional word problems was administered to a large group (n = 343) of 6- to 7-year-olds. Results show that relational preference is also associated with word-problem solving behavior at this young age: an additive preference is related with better performance on additive word problems but also with more erroneous additive reasoning in proportional word problems. Similarly, a multiplicative preference is related with better performance on proportional word problems but not yet with more erroneous proportional reasoning in additive word problems. The latter is possibly due to the low number of proportional errors that were made in the additive word problems at this young age. The implications of these findings for further research and educational practice are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Teaching mathematical modeling is a demanding task. Thus, fostering teachers’ competencies in this regard is an essential component of teacher education. Recent conceptualizations of teachers’ competencies include situation-specific skills based on the concept of noticing, which is of particular interest for the spontaneous reactions needed when teaching mathematical modeling. The study described in this paper aims to analyze the development of a video-based instrument for measuring teachers’ noticing competencies within a mathematical modeling context and obtain evidence for the validity of the instrument. Three kinds of validity are examined in three different studies: content validity, elemental validity and construct validity. Indicators for content validity could be found through different expert ratings and implementation with the target group, where participants were able to perceive all relevant aspects. The qualitative analysis of participants’ reasoning, which is consistent with the coded level, indicates elemental validity. Moreover, the results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest construct validity with one overall factor of noticing competence within a mathematical modeling context. Taken together, these studies imply a satisfactory validity of the video-based instrument.</p>

                    <p>This is a commentary on the ESM 2021 Special Issue on Innovations in Measuring and Fostering Mathematical Modelling Competencies. We have grouped the ten studies into three themes: competencies, fostering, and measuring. The first theme and the papers therein provide a platform to discuss the cognitivist backgrounds to the different conceptualizations of mathematical modelling competencies, based on the modelling cycle. We suggest theoretical widening through a competence continuum and enriching of the modelling cycle with overarching, analytic dimensions for creativity, tool use, metacognition, and so forth. The second theme and the papers therein showcase innovative ideas on fostering and on the definition and analysis thereof. These reveal the need for a social turn in modelling research in order to capture aspects of student collaboration and agency, as well as tensions in fostering when tasks are derived from real-world scenarios, but socio-mathematical norms come from the (pure) mathematics classroom. The third theme, measuring, and the papers therein offer insights into the challenges of positivist research that aims to develop innovative measurement instruments that are both reliable and valid, particularly in light of student group work, cultural background, and other socio-cultural aspects. Drawing on the three discussions, we go on to make recommendations for further research.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>To solve mathematical modelling problems, students must translate real-world situations, which are typically presented in text form, into mathematical models. To complete the translation process, the problem-solver must first understand the real-world situation. Therefore, reading comprehension can be considered an essential part of solving modelling problems, and fostering reading comprehension might lead to better modelling competence. Further, ease of comprehension and involvement have been found to increase interest in the learning material, and thus, improving reading comprehension might also increase interest in modelling. The aims of this study were to (a) determine whether providing students with reading comprehension prompts would improve the modelling sub-competencies needed to construct a model of the real-world situation and their interest in modelling and (b) analyze the hypothesized effects in two different educational environments (Germany and Taiwan). We conducted an experimental study of 495 ninth graders (201 German and 294 Taiwanese students). The results unexpectedly revealed that providing reading comprehension prompts did not affect the construction of a real-world model. Further, providing reading comprehension prompts improved students’ situational interest. The effects of providing reading comprehension prompts on the construction of a real-world model were similar in Germany and Taiwan. Students’ interest in modelling improved more in Germany. An in-depth quantitative analysis of students’ responses to reading prompts, their solutions, and their interest in the experimental group confirmed the positive relation between reading comprehension and modelling and indicated that the reading comprehension prompts were not sufficient for improving reading comprehension. Implications for future research are discussed.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This paper reports on empirical results about the influence of two different teaching designs on the development of tertiary students’ modelling competency and attitudes towards modelling. A total of 144 first year engineering students were exposed to a diagnostic entrance test, a modelling unit consisting of five lessons with ten tasks, enframed by a pre- and a post-test, and at the end a questionnaire on attitudes towards mathematical modelling. Similar to the German DISUM study, in the modelling unit, one group of participants followed an independence-oriented teaching style, aiming at a balance between students’ independent work and teacher’s guidance, while two other groups were taught according to a more traditional teacher-guided style. Linear mixed regression models were used to compare pre- and post-test results. The results show that all groups had significant learning progress, although there is much room for further improvement, and that the group taught according to the independence-oriented design had the biggest competency growth. In addition, this group exhibited more positive attitudes than the other groups in five of six attitudinal aspects.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Although mathematical modeling plays an important role in many curricula worldwide, significant discrepancies persist in the importance of mathematical modeling in ordinary mathematics classrooms and teacher education. This paper compares pre-service mathematics teachers’ professional mathematical modeling competencies in three different regions—Germany, Mainland China, and Hong Kong—where educational and cultural traditions differ, including the role of mathematical modeling. In total, 232 pre-service mathematics teachers from the three regions completed a modeling task covering mathematics content knowledge (MCK) of modeling and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) of modeling. The results show that pre-service teachers from Germany demonstrated the strongest MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling; by contrast, pre-service mathematics teachers from Mainland China and Hong Kong demonstrated relatively weaker MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling. MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling were also found to be unevenly developed at different competence levels for the three regions. These differences may be attributed to the history of mathematical modeling in mathematics curricula, teacher education, and teaching culture in these three regions.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Modelling competencies are currently included in numerous curricula worldwide and are generally accepted as a complex, process-oriented construct. Therefore, effective measurement should include multiple dimensions, like the sub-competencies required throughout the modelling process. Departing from the characteristics of modelling problems as open and often underdetermined real-world problems, we propose to enrich the current conceptualisation of mathematical modelling competencies by including creativity, which plays an important role in numerous phases of the mathematical modelling process but has scarcely been considered in modelling discourse. In the study described in this paper, a new instrument for the evaluation of this enriched construct has been developed and implemented. The modelling competencies incorporating creativity of the students were evaluated based on the adequacy of the models and the modelling processes proposed, and the appropriateness and completeness of the approaches were evaluated in detail. Adapting measurement approaches for creativity that have been developed in the problem-solving discourse, certain criteria of creativity were selected to evaluate the creativity of the students’ approaches in tackling modelling problems—namely, usefulness, fluency, and originality. The empirical study was conducted among 107 Chinese students at the upper secondary school level, who attended a modelling camp and independently solved three complex modelling problems. The results reveal significant correlations between fluency and originality in students’ performances across all tasks; however, the relationships between usefulness and the other two creativity aspects were not consistent. Overall, the results of the study support the importance of the inclusion of creativity in the construct of modelling competencies.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Community college students face difficulties in mathematics courses and may not understand the relevance of the topics they are learning to their intended career. When such connections are not made, mathematics courses can become barriers to pursuit of careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In the present study, we assessed student interest in mathematics and various STEM career areas and students’ knowledge of ways mathematics was involved in STEM careers in order to better understand how these variables are related. We discovered that interest in mathematics predicted interest in many, but not all, categories of STEM and STEM-related careers. We also assessed how deeply the student was engaged with their current career pathway, and how this related to other variables. We found that students’ depth of interest in their chosen career path was only associated with mathematics interest for some STEM careers. Finally, students’ perceptions of how mathematics was used in their chosen career area predicted their interest in mathematics, and their interest in some STEM career areas.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Mathematical modelling competencies have become a prominent construct in research on the teaching and learning of mathematical modelling and its applications in recent decades; however, current research is diverse, proposing different theoretical frameworks and a variety of research designs for the measurement and fostering of modelling competencies. The study described in this paper was a systematic literature review of the literature on modelling competencies published over the past two decades. Based on a full-text analysis of 75 peer-reviewed studies indexed in renowned databases and published in English, the study revealed the dominance of an analytical, bottom-up approach for conceptualizing modelling competencies and distinguishing a variety of sub-competencies. Furthermore, the analysis showed the great richness of methods for measuring modelling competencies, although a focus on (non-standardized) tests prevailed. Concerning design and offering for fostering modelling competencies, the majority of the papers reported training strategies for modelling courses. Overall, the current literature review pointed out the necessity for further theoretical work on conceptualizing mathematical modelling competencies while highlighting the richness of developed empirical approaches and their implementation at various educational levels.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>In this article, we describe the generation of a Design and Implementation Framework for Mathematical Modelling Tasks (DIFMT) through a researcher-teacher collaboration. The purpose of the framework is to support holistic approaches to instructional modelling competency. This framework is underpinned by principles drawn from theory and praxis which are informed by the anticipatory capabilities that teachers require for the design and effective implementation of quality modelling tasks in secondary classrooms. A draft DIFMT was developed from a synthesis of research literature and was refined through an iterative process of task development, implementation and observation, reflection through teacher/student interviews, and revision of the framework. Each iteration made use of the most recent refinement of the co-constructed DIFMT, building theory while simultaneously addressing a problem in educational practice, consistent with a design-based methodology. Thus, the DIMFT developed organically throughout the project. While initial modelling exemplars were researcher-designed, the locus of responsibility moved to teachers as the project progressed. The DIFMT consists of two major components—principles for modelling task design and pedagogical architecture—each of which is structured around dimensions that include elaborations which detail the knowledge required for modelling as well as teacher and student capabilities.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>Though there is an extensive research literature on understanding and assessing individual modeling competencies, less attention has been given to characterizing the social context of the classroom in which modeling occurs. Yet a classroom’s culture of modeling—its negotiated system of beliefs and values about the nature of modeling and what constitutes a complete, satisfactory solution to a modeling problem—has a shaping influence on its members’ participation in modeling activities. Devising a means of assessing classroom modeling cultures is thus a crucial task for both research and praxis. In this article, we present an approach to operationally defining and assessing classroom modeling cultures, which is (a) based in quantitative analyses of discourse during whole-class presentations of modeling solutions, and (b) grounded in research in individual modeling competencies. We show how our assessment distinguishes the classroom modeling cultures of different classrooms and how it captures shifts over time in the modeling culture of a given classroom. Finally, we accompany our quantitative results with interpretive analyses of presentation discourse, to triangulate and to attribute meaning to the patterns our assessment detects. Our primary data sources include video recorded presentation and Q&amp;A sessions for three modeling activities in each of two US middle school (Grades 5–8) classrooms. Our assessment approach is a significant contribution because it operationalizes the construct of a classroom’s modeling culture, in terms that highlight potential connections with the research literature of individual modeling competencies. It therefore invites modeling research that coordinates learning and development across individual and social levels.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>The article deals with the pedagogical content knowledge of mathematical modelling as part of the professional competence of pre-service teachers. With the help of a test developed for this purpose from a conceptual model, we examine whether this pedagogical content knowledge can be promoted in its different facets—especially knowledge about modelling tasks and about interventions—by suitable university seminars. For this purpose, the test was administered to three groups in a seminar for the teaching of mathematical modelling: (1) to those respondents who created their own modelling tasks for use with students, (2) to those trained to intervene in mathematical modelling processes, and (3) participating students who are not required to address mathematical modelling. The findings of the study—based on variance analysis—indicate that certain facets (knowledge of modelling tasks, modelling processes, and interventions) have increased significantly in both experimental groups but to varying degrees. By contrast, pre-service teachers in the control group demonstrated no significant change to their level of pedagogical content knowledge.</p>

  Abstract
                    <p>This study examined how expert and novice (preservice) teachers solved mathematical modelling tasks as well as how they noticed written artifacts of student thinking that were in response to the mathematical modelling tasks. Some teachers in both groups were aware of the openness and underdetermination of the modelling tasks and that these characteristics implied that underlying assumptions needed to be made in order to solve the tasks. Indeed, nearly all of the expert teachers addressed the need to make assumptions for the Seashell Task. When examining student work, both expert and preservice teachers interpreted positive aspects in the students’ solutions and provided feedback to students. However, almost all of the expert teachers responded by asking questions, whereas around a third of preservice teachers directly corrected students’ mistakes and another third pointed out mistakes without correcting them. This study provides a new angle to study teachers’ mathematical competencies, the assessment of modelling competencies, and considerations for the development of teachers’ modelling competencies.</p>
