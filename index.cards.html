  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 42-47, November 2022. <br> In education, we share a common commitment to supporting students’ growth and development, but we often have different ideas about what that support looks like. A theory of action describes how a specific education organization intends to work to create the outcomes it wants. Abby Javurek Andres and Chase Nordengren describe how to develop and enact a theory of action that meets the needs of the school community. The process involves bringing people together to gain understanding of the problem, learning what is going well and building a shared vision of success, and aligning communications and decision-making around the shared vision.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 24-28, November 2022. <br> Schools across the United States use abeyance agreements as an alternative to suspension or expulsion, yet little is known about them. These agreements allow students to avoid or reduce suspensions or expulsions, if they meet the terms of the agreement and waive certain due process rights. David Perrodin argues that these agreements enable school districts to circumvent requirements to report disciplinary data, a requirement intended to ensure schools’ disciplinary practices are fair and nondiscriminatory. These agreements appear to give students on the brink of suspension a second chance, but the terms are sometimes difficult to follow, and once the terms are broken, students may be subject to suspension without due process. They also bring disciplinary investigations to a quick close, sometimes without a clear understanding of the root causes of the misbehavior. And the lack of data about abeyance agreements means that authorities lose information that is useful in identifying potential safety threats or uncovering schools’ violations of students’ rights. Perrodin argues for the elimination of abeyance agreements for school discipline or for more standardized processes that can be tracked and that do not interfere with students’ rights.

However, using the current data, schools perceived as “good” tend to be in better-resourced districts and enroll higher percentages of wealthy and white students. Schools perceived as “bad” tend to be in more economically oppressed districts and enroll higher percentages of low-income students and students of color. James Noonan and Jack Schneider suggest more equitable collection of better and more nuanced data about schools can provide more complete pictures of strengths and weaknesses and could offer a way to spur investment in under resourced schools.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 58-60, November 2022. <br> No Child Left Behind and the Every Student Succeeds Act have made accountability central to conversations about education policy. But neither statute articulates a clear vision of what constitutes “quality” or “equity” in education, nor do they include a mechanism to ensure that schools have sufficient resources to pursue that vision. For that, Bob Kim explains, we must turn to the courts. Kim discusses some of the court cases that have set out frameworks for determining whether schools are providing an adequate or equitable education and for providing the resources needed to do so.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>At the present time, information and communication technology (ICT) has played a vital role in socio-economic development such as economic growth, literacy, life expectancy, and employment levels in societies, however, such development has come with various environmental damages perspectives. This study scrutinizes the impact of ICT, economic growth, and foreign direct investment (FDI) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the 44 One Belt and Road Initiative (OBRI) countries split into sub-region from 1991 to 2019. This study applied various econometrics approaches such as cross-sectional dependence, second-generation unit root, and Westerlund panel cointegration techniques are executed to analyze the panel data set. The full modified ordinary lease square and dynamic ordinary lease square estimators are applied to investigate the long–term influence of ICT development, GDP (economic growth), and FDI on CO2 emissions. The empirical analysis was performed at a disaggregated level to assess the possible environmental influences across the OBRI countries. Overall, the results reported that broadband and mobile development have an adverse effect on CO2 emissions. The finding further reveals that the broadband indicator negatively affects CO2 emissions in all OBRI regions except South Asia. Similarly, the mobile use indicator protects the environmental quality in all OBRI regions except MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and Central Asia. Regarding country-wise analysis, broadband has alleviated the pollution level in 21 countries, while mobile has alleviated it in 15 countries. Moreover, economic growth is responsible to increase pollution levels in all panels and regions except Europe. Besides, the results highlight that higher FDI reduces environmental pollution whereby, the pollution halo hypothesis is supported to hold for all OBRI panels and regions except MENA countries. Based on the empirical findings, the policymakers and governments of these economies should design policies to grow smarter cities, transportation systems, electrical grids, industrial processes, and energy-saving production through ICT development on a macro level.

A recent Heritage Foundation report, for example, found that schools with equity officers have the lowest achievement outcomes. Mary Rice-Boothe and Tanji Reed Marshall point out, however, that student achievement is not the only metric for determining the success of equity officers. When holding equity officers accountable, it’s important to be clear about the expectations for the role, establish appropriate measurements to assess their effectiveness, and provide supports that set the leaders up for success.

Teresa Preston summarizes the arguments made in the issue on “Reframing Accountability.” These include discussions of limitations of testing, the need for other accountability measures, the use of data to promote improvement, and the importance of capacity building in any accountability system.

But the COVID-19 pandemic led many schools, states, and districts to put their testing and accountability programs on hold. Chester E. Finn, Jr., argues that it is time for the accountability holiday to end and makes recommendations for how to ensure the accountability programs are effective. Requirements for effective accountability include rigorous standards; assessments and other metrics; consequences for failing to meet, meeting, and exceeding standards; and the capacity to make changes needed to improve.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 104, Issue 3, Page 56-57, November 2022. <br> The work of a school leader can be compared to that of an architect, who must bring a team together to create something original on a solid foundation. Aaron Spence, superintendent of Virginia Beach City Public Schools, came to the district nine years ago, ready to serve the district where he’d grown up. His previous experiences in school leadership had given him a vision for equity-based transformation, but the district had a more immediate need — getting all schools accredited. Joshua P. Starr explains how focusing on this urgent need enabled him to build relationships that helped him when it was time to turn to more transformative goals. This initial work proved to be the foundation on which the new work could rest.
