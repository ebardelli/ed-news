  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Research shows that Early College high schools have a significant impact on high school and college outcomes for students from low income and racial/ethnic minority backgrounds, but how similar opportunities extend to English learners (ELs) remains unknown. We examine a program that offers Early College opportunities in high schools serving large EL populations in California. Leveraging an exogenous policy change and rich administrative records, we look at the outcomes of pre- and postprogram cohorts of ELs (N = 15,090) in treated and untreated high schools. We find large, significant estimated effects on college credits earned in 12th grade but no effect on immediate college attendance after high school. The probability of attending a 4-year college decreased.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The continuous improvement (CI) approach to systems change has rapidly spread across education policy circles in recent years and has been hailed as a promising means to achieve educational equity and social justice. CI’s highly routinized, scientific process for improving efficiency and productivity is a somewhat unexpected means to pursue equity. To understand this puzzle, I examine the use of CI to promote equity through two qualitative, multilevel case studies. I draw on institutional theory to understand how CI has integrated logics of racial equity and performance, and how local actors have improvised novel approaches. This analysis illuminates the complex institutional dynamics at play with CI implementation and identifies the challenges and promise of using CI to promote educational equity.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 5, Page 36-41, February 2022. <br> A new body of research shows that project-based learning (PBL) can be effective in improving students’ academic performance and attempts to define some of the key practices that are essential to PBL. Kristin De Vivo summarizes key findings of four studies that covered multiple grade levels and subjects. The studies found that PBL is effective across racial and socioeconomic groups and reading levels. When teachers receive a well-designed curriculum, with professional development, they can quickly implement PBL. Key PBL practices include giving students opportunities to ask and answer authentic questions, aligning projects to standards, and collaborating to foster interdisciplinary learning.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 5, Page 47-53, February 2022. <br> Recent discussions about critical race theory (CRT) have exposed, once again, the heated disagreements that prevail in the United States regarding the nature of its racial past and present. This debate is highly significant in itself, but the dispute is also noteworthy for revealing how quickly a contentious issue can become a lightning rod for considerations of what students should learn. This article addresses CRT and the role it can play in helping to explore past and current racial politics; the value of placing the current controversy within the context of a long history of curriculum conflict; and the need for critical reflection, active collaboration, and courage among educators.

In a study of 55,000 secondary school students across the United States, Challenge Success found further evidence of the bilateral relationship between students’ experiences of academic engagement and their sense of belonging, specifically when tied to school practices aimed at creating an authentic culture of inclusion and respect, an environment that fosters student agency, and assessment practices that are perceived as fair and equitable. Denise Pope and Sarah Miles share research-based strategies for educators seeking to create a climate of care that promotes both engagement and belonging.

Kristabel Stark, Neesha Daulat, and Simon King explain why teachers’ emotional well-being matters for the health of school organizations and why the nature of teachers’ emotional well-being is often misunderstood. They then share the findings of a qualitative study in which they interviewed nine educators who are leading a re-envisioning of teacher well-being in their schools and districts. They conclude with ideas for how schools can shift their organizational cultures to better support teachers’ emotional well-being.

Educators should embrace three core commitments in particular: 1) to treat students as learners whose agency is respected, whose diversity is embraced, whose selves are deeply known, whose joy is cultivated, and whose holistic growth is the paramount concern of the adults who care for them; 2) to promote learning that is purposeful, authentic, and connected to the broader human domains of which those learners are part; and 3) to create learning communities that enable deep relationships, cultivate democratic values and dispositions, and model the kind of society and environment we want to create.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Many states and school districts are implementing reforms to reduce reliance on exclusionary discipline such as out-of-school suspension and expulsion. This article uses survey and administrative data to study the implementation of a state-level policy limiting elementary school out-of-school suspension and expulsions. While the results are limited in sample size and generalizability, we find that survey respondents from relatively disadvantaged schools reported greater difficulties and challenges with implementation and tended to comply at lower rates. Policy makers seeking more equitable implementation of these types of reforms should work with schools to better understand and attend to local preferences, buy-in, and capacity for implementation.

But by the 1990s, authors began writing regularly about why teachers should care about students and how they can demonstrate that care by building positive relationships with them. Teresa Preston shares some of their insights in this monthly Kappan column.

The authors in the February 2022 Kappan consider how to approach these relationships with care.

Fortunately, there are innovations from research and development efforts that can help districts put into practice the best ideas about instructional coaching. Andrew Wayne and Jane Coggshall describe how detailed manuals, online platforms, and clear monitoring routines can help district leaders ensure that the chosen coaching program is being implemented with fidelity.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 5, Page 13-17, February 2022. <br> Care and social-emotional supports are of concern for school district leaders who want to create a caring culture throughout their district. In their study of central office leaders, Kate Kennedy and Jeff Walls found that caring leadership is complex, that school district leaders practice care in collaboration with others, that partnerships with community organizations enable a constellation of care, and that diversity and equity initiatives are considered complementary but separate initiatives. They recommend that leaders work with stakeholders across their districts to define caring, plan for the provision of social-emotional well-being supports, promote collaborative structures, cultivate internal and external resources, draw on data to drive caring initiatives, and weave an equity orientation into caring leadership structures.

Over the course of the school’s eight-year existence, the faculty has worked to become green not only in name and in terms of its facility, but also in its instructional practice. The school made many efforts to reach this goal, yet the staff worried that fully embracing environmental education would take too much time away from core content. Teacher Jennifer Potts describes how the need for social distancing and increased ventilation during the COVID-19 pandemic led the staff to spend more time outdoors and see opportunities to more fully integrate environmental education and outdoor learning into regular lessons.

First, the detrended cross-correlation analysis was adopted to measure the fractal correlation of different securities. Second, the fractal correlation was embedded into the mean-variance criterion of the modern portfolio theory. Third, the mean-detrended cross-correlation analysis portfolio strategy of multiple risk assets was constructed, and the analytic solution of the strategy was given. Finally, the evaluation results revealed that the constructed the mean-detrended cross-correlation analysis portfolio strategy clearly improved investment performance, thus achieving the goal of optimizing the multiple risk asset portfolio strategy.
