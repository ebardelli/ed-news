  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Since its introduction as an analytic and theoretical tool for the examination of racism in education, CRT scholarship has proliferated as the most visible critical theory of race in educational research. Whereas CRT’s popularity can be viewed as a welcome sign, scholars continually caution against its misappropriation and overuse, which dilute its criticality. We draw from the cautionary ethos of this canon of literature as the impetus for examining CRT’s terrain in social studies education research. Starting from Ladson-Billings’s watershed edited CRT text on race and social studies in 2003, this study provides a comprehensive theoretical review of scholarly literature in the social studies education field pertinent to the nexus of CRT, racialized citizenship, and race(ism). To guide our review, we asked how social studies education scholars have defined and used CRT as an analytic and theoretical framework in social studies education research from 2004 to 2019, as well as how scholars have positioned CRT within social studies education research to foreground the relationship between citizenship and race. Overall, findings from our theoretical review illustrated that contrary to the proliferation of CRT in educational research, CRT was slow to catch on as a theoretical and analytic framework in social studies education, as only seven of the articles in our analysis were published between 2004 and 2010. However, CRT emerged as a viable framework for the examination of race, racism, and racialized citizenship between 2011 and 2019, with a majority of these studies emphasizing (a) the centrality of race as a core tenet of CRT, (b) idealist interrogations of race, (c) the perspectives of teachers of color and White teachers in learning how to teach about race, and (d) the role of race and racism in curricular analyses that serve as counternarrative to the master script of the nation’s linear social progress in social studies education.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>We present results from a meta-analysis of 37 contemporary experimental and quasi-experimental studies of summer programs in mathematics for children in grades pre-K–12, examining what resources and characteristics predict stronger student achievement. Children who participated in summer programs that included mathematics activities experienced significantly better mathematics achievement outcomes compared to their control group counterparts. We find an average weighted impact estimate of +0.10 standard deviations on mathematics achievement outcomes. We find similar effects for programs conducted in higher- and lower-poverty settings. We undertook a secondary analysis exploring the effect of summer programs on noncognitive outcomes and found positive mean impacts. The results indicate that summer programs are a promising tool to strengthen children’s mathematical proficiency outside of school time.

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Differential item functioning (DIF) occurs when the probability of endorsing an item differs across groups for individuals with the same latent trait level. The presence of DIF items may jeopardize the validity of an instrument; therefore, it is crucial to identify DIF items in routine operations of educational assessment. While DIF detection procedures based on item response theory (IRT) have been widely used, a majority of IRT-based DIF tests assume predefined anchor (i.e., DIF-free) items. Not only is this assumption strong, but violations to it may also lead to erroneous inferences, for example, an inflated Type I error rate. We propose a general framework to define the effect sizes of DIF without a priori knowledge of anchor items. In particular, we quantify DIF by item-specific residuals from a regression model fitted to the true item parameters in respective groups. Moreover, the null distribution of the proposed test statistic using robust estimator can be derived analytically or approximated numerically even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, which yields asymptotically justified statistical inference. The Type I error rate and the power performance of the proposed procedure are evaluated and compared with the conventional likelihood-ratio DIF tests in a Monte Carlo experiment. Our simulation study has shown promising results in controlling Type I error rate and power of detecting DIF items. Even when there is a mix of DIF and non-DIF items, the true and false alarm rate can be well controlled when a robust regression estimator is used.

  Abstract
                  <p>Teachers’ questioning plays an essential role in shaping collective argumentative discourse. This paper demonstrated that rationality dimensions in teacher questions can be assessed by adapting Habermas’ three components of rationality. By coordinating Habermas’ construct with Toulmin’s model for argumentation, this paper investigated how two secondary mathematics teachers used rational questioning to support student participation in collective argumentation. This paper identified various ways in which two participating teachers used rational questioning to support student participation in argumentation via contributions of argument components. The results establish a theoretical connection between the use of rational questions and students’ contributions of components of arguments. The results indicated that not all rational questions were associated with a component of argument, and rational questions may additionally support argumentation in general for the development of a culture of rationality. The study has implications in terms of theory and professional development of teachers.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>This study forms part of a classroom teaching experiment on the development of a group of 25 9–10 years old students’ algebraic thinking. More specifically, it explored their reasoning while solving word problems built around functional relationships to determine how they generalized through questions posed using natural language, drawn figures or the keyword ‘many’. Their written and oral answers to those questions were analyzed qualitatively to determine which approach most effectively supported the expression of their generalization. The results reveal the benefits of posing questions about the general case in different ways while teaching students to use conventional algebraic representations. According to these findings, representing indeterminate quantities with the keyword ‘many’ induces generalization more successfully than representing them with letters. The use of letters prompts students to seek meaning for the letters, either conventionally, as an unknown or variable quantity, or otherwise, as a label or specific values assigned according to their own criteria. Identifying the most effective procedures may help teachers and curriculum designers formulate mathematical tasks that encourage students to express the generality they perceive in particular cases. Determining the communication demands of each approach is likewise highly useful.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Bounded continuous data are encountered in many applications of item response theory, including the measurement of mood, personality, and response times and in the analyses of summed item scores. Although different item response theory models exist to analyze such bounded continuous data, most models assume the data to be in an open interval and cannot accommodate data in a closed interval. As a result, ad hoc transformations are needed to prevent scores on the bounds of the observed variables. To motivate the present study, we demonstrate in real and simulated data that this practice of fitting open interval models to closed interval data can majorly affect parameter estimates even in cases with only 5% of the responses on one of the bounds of the observed variables. To address this problem, we propose a zero and one inflated item response theory modeling framework for bounded continuous responses in the closed interval. We illustrate how four existing models for bounded responses from the literature can be accommodated in the framework. The resulting zero and one inflated item response theory models are studied in a simulation study and a real data application to investigate parameter recovery, model fit, and the consequences of fitting the incorrect distribution to the data. We find that neglecting the bounded nature of the data biases parameters and that misspecification of the exact distribution may affect the results depending on the data generating model.

  Abstract
                  <p>Lockwood has argued that taking a set-oriented perspective is critical for successful combinatorial enumeration. To date, however, the research literature has not yet captured the cognitive processes involved in taking such a perspective. In this theoretical paper, we elaborate the constructs of spatial structuring and spatial-numerical linked structuring from within our constructivist theoretical perspective to provide a cognitive account of how students conceptualize and generate combinatorial composites. Our elaborations emerged from analyzing and reflecting on data from two constructivist teaching experiments examining undergraduate students’ combinatorial concepts, mental actions, and strategies. We define multiple constructs in our theoretical approach, including spatial-temporal-enactive (or S*-) structuring, two specific forms of S*-structuring (intra-composite and inter-composite structuring), numerical structuring, and S*-numerical linked structuring. We then illustrate how our framework can be used to analyze students’ physical/mental actions and operations when engaging in combinatorial inquiry. Critically, our findings suggest that successful and meaningful combinatorial enumeration depends on constructing intra-composite S*-structuring for single combinatorial composites, then abstracting, reflecting on, generalizing, and linking this intra-composite structuring to an inter-composite structuring to generate the set of combinatorial composites. We conclude with a discussion of how our paper contributes to existing research on combinatorial reasoning.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Self-efficacy in mathematics is related to engagement, persistence, and academic performance. Prior research focused mostly on examining changes to students’ self-efficacy across large time intervals (months or years), and paid less attention to changes at the level of lesson sequences. Knowledge of how self-efficacy changes during a sequence of lessons is important as it can help teachers better support students’ self-efficacy in their everyday work. In this paper, we expanded previous studies by investigating changes in students’ self-efficacy across a sequence of 3–4 lessons when students were learning a new topic in mathematics (nStudents = 170, nTime-points = 596). Nine classes of Norwegian grade 6 (n = 77) and grade 10 students (n = 93) reported their self-efficacy for easy, medium difficulty, and hard tasks. Using multilevel models for change, we found (a) change of students’ self-efficacy across lesson sequences, (b) differences in the starting point and change of students’ self-efficacy according to perceived task difficulty and grade, (c) more individual variation of self-efficacy starting point and change in association with harder tasks, and (d) students in classes who were taught a new topic in geometry had stronger self-efficacy at the beginning of the first lesson as compared to those who were taught a new topic in algebra (grade 10), and students in classes who were taught a new topic in fractions had steeper growth across the lesson sequence as compared to those who were taught a new topic in measurement (grade 6). Implications for both research and practice on how new mathematics topics are introduced to students are discussed.</p>

We interviewed 19 preservice teacher candidates and report on their experiences when selecting their university of choice, the barriers they faced, and the supports they received. Participants reported coming to their university because of cost, location, and reputation. They reported common barriers such as inability to work, caring for children, and lack of support or access to other resources. However, participants reported professors and external funding as the major factors that had helped them succeed. Implications about this diverse group of students are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>Lockdowns imposed by many countries on their populations at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis forced teachers to adapt quickly and without adequate preparation to distance teaching. In this paper, we focus on one of the most formidable challenges that teachers faced during the lockdowns and even in the post-lockdown emergency period, namely, developing assessment that maintains the pedagogical continuity that educational institutions typically require. Based on the results of a previous study, focused on the analysis of answers to an open-ended questionnaire administered to a population of 700 teachers from France, Germany, Israel and Italy, a semi-structured interview series was designed and implemented by the authors of this paper with a small group of teachers. The transcripts of these interviews were analysed according to the interpretative phenomenological analysis methodology, with the aim of investigating teachers’ own perspectives on the following: (a) the difficulties with which they had to contend, with respect to the question of assessment; (b) the techniques adopted to deal with these difficulties; and (c) the ways in which the lockdown experience could affect the future evolution of teachers’ assessment practices. This analysis supported us in formulating hypotheses concerning the possible long-term effects of lockdown on modes of assessment in mathematics.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP; e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1995) is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to serve culturally and linguistically diverse student learners. Although a large body of work describes its tenets and permutations, and its implications for students, less work has been done to outline the myriad barriers that teachers face when trying to implement CRP. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a race-conscious, multilevel, ecological framework to illuminate the societal, institutional, and individual obstacles that teachers must navigate in the pursuit of CRP. Implications for teacher training and development are discussed.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, we provide an overall perspective on the teaching and learning of discrete mathematics. Our aim is to highlight what research has been conducted in this area and to connect it to existing research ideas for future work. We begin by characterizing discrete mathematics and its role in the school curriculum, highlighting themes, topics, and mathematical practices that distinguish discrete mathematics. We then present potential benefits of focusing on discrete mathematics topics for mathematics education; in particular, we discuss the accessibility of topics in discrete mathematics, the connection to mathematical processes and affect, and the relevance of discrete mathematics in our current society. We also emphasize discrete mathematics from an international perspective, highlighting studies from the US, Italy, France, Chile, and Germany, which are across all school levels–primary, middle, and secondary school, and with some implications for post-secondary education. We particularly discuss discrete topics including number theory, combinatorics, iteration and recursion, graph theory, and discrete games and puzzles; we describe and situate these topics within literature. We also suggest the additional topics of game theory and the mathematics of fairness that we hope to see addressed in future studies.</p>

  Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Ahead of Print. <br>New York City’s school system is among the most diverse and segregated in the United States. Using difference-in-differences and placebo tests, we evaluate two desegregation policies in two geographic districts in New York City, District 3 and District 15. Both districts attempted to lower economic segregation within their district while maintaining school choice, prioritizing economically disadvantaged students for middle school seats in advance of the 2019–2020 school year. District 15, however, set more ambitious prioritization targets and also chose to eliminate academic screens from all middle schools. We find that District 15’s policy lowered economic segregation in sixth grade by 55% and racial segregation by 38%, while District 3’s policy led to no significant change in segregation.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>Mentoring is an essential fixture of teacher education. With growing opportunities for international learning exchanges, there is a need to better understand how cross-cultural mentoring can be characterized by reciprocal learning. This study investigated mentee perceptions of the mentoring relationship in an international, cross-cultural teacher education exchange. We conducted research among 19 Chinese preservice teachers who participated in an international teacher education exchange program, exploring their perspectives on the cross-cultural mentoring relationship and mutual learning. Our findings suggest that learning outcomes are improved in a mentoring relationship when there are strong relational ties, opportunities for reciprocal learning, and a greater awareness of cultural complexity. We contend that there is value in supporting the mentoring relationship directly, which has implications for both international exchanges and teacher education programs.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>How do teachers account for homework-related inequalities? Our longitudinal ethnographic study reveals that, despite awareness of structural inequalities in their students’ lives, elementary- and middle-school teachers’ practices centered the myth of meritocracy. They treat struggles with math homework as products of students’ and (particularly in elementary grades) parents’ insufficient responsibility, effort, and motivation. These interpretations then justify homework practices that reinforce inequalities, including assigning homework that exceeds what students can complete independently and rewarding/punishing students based on homework. We discuss implications for debates about homework and the dangers of meritocracy myths and offer recommendations for more equitable alternatives.

  Abstract
                  <p>Students’ attitudes can be influential in the emotions experienced in mathematics learning and achievement at school. Two important judgements, according to Control-Value Theory are degree of control a student has over, and the value attached to, learning activities or outcomes. Appraisals of control and value are believed to play a central role in the emotions experienced when learning, and subsequent achievement. Achievement, in turn, can strengthen or weaken control-value appraisals. In the present study we set out to examine the bidirectional relations between control-value appraisals and a key emotion experienced in the mathematics classroom, namely anxiety. In addition, we tested the proposition that control-value appraisals are indirectly linked to achievement, mediated by classroom-related anxiety. The participants were 1242 Year 5 students (49% female), with a mean of 9.3 years, from 24 English primary schools. Self-report data for anxiety, and control-value appraisals, were collected over two waves (separated by seven months) and mathematics achievement collected from a classroom test one week later. Results from a structural equation model showed bidirectional relations between higher anxiety and lower control. Although anxiety predicted lower value, value was unrelated to subsequent anxiety. Higher control at the first wave of measurement was related to higher mathematics achievement, mediated by lower anxiety, at the second wave. These results underscore the importance of reducing anxiety when learning mathematics and suggest that intervention could achieve this outcome by reducing anxiety directly or by strengthening control.</p>

  Abstract
                  <p>Discrete mathematics brings interesting problems for teaching and learning proof, with accessible objects such as integers (arithmetic), graphs (modeling, order) or polyominoes (geometry). Many problems that are still open can be explained to a large public. The objects can be manipulated by simple dynamic operations (removing, adding, ‘gluing’, contracting, splitting, decomposing, etc.). All these operations can be seen as tools for proving. In this paper we particularly explore the field of ‘discrete optimization’. A theoretical background is defined by taking two main axes into account, namely, the epistemological analysis of discrete problems studied by contemporary researchers in discrete optimization and the design of adidactical situations for classrooms in the frame of the Theory of Didactical Situations. Two problems coming from ongoing research in discrete optimization (the Pentamino Exclusion and the Eight Queens problems) are developed and transposed for the classroom. They underscore the learning potentialities of discrete mathematics and epistemological obstacles concerning proving processes. They emphasize the understanding of a necessary condition and a sufficient condition and problematize the difference between optimal and optimum. They provide proofs involving partitioning strategies, greedy algorithms but also primal–dual methods leading to the concept of duality. The way such problems can be implemented in the classroom is described in a collaborative study by mathematicians and mathematics education researchers (Maths à Modeler Research Federation) through the Research Situations for the Classroom project.</p>

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>From a teacher’s perspective, teacher learning happens through a complex web of learning experiences. However, research on teacher professional development (PD) typically focuses on the direct influence of single activities or programs. PD researchers less often acknowledge the interactive impacts on teacher learning of the multiple experiences teachers have in different contexts. This conceptual paper works toward a more thoroughgoing ecological framing of teacher PD by bringing forth three dimensions of teacher learning that are often overlooked: scope, interconnectedness, and temporality. The essay centers on the type of design that is widely considered high-quality PD—namely, experiences that are collaborative and situated in teachers’ instructional context—and considers those experiences from the perspective of these three dimensions. I illustrate this framework and its affordances with data from a 4-year research project rooted in video-based mathematics teacher conversations. The focus on scope allows researchers to name and distinguish contexts that are salient to their different studies. The focus on interconnectedness uncovers the interactive relationship between the immediate and broader PD contexts. Finally, the focus on temporality affords the understanding of different phases in learning and extends linear conceptions of progress. Together, these dimensions provide a rich conceptualization to better inform the work of teacher educators.

  Journal of Teacher Education, Ahead of Print. <br>In the present study, we examine whether characteristics of student teaching sites and cooperating teachers predict teacher candidates’ edTPA scores. Using data from North Carolina, we find that candidates earn higher edTPA scores if they student-taught in a high value-added school and with a cooperating teacher earning higher evaluation ratings. Evidence also suggests that candidates earn higher scores when they are mentored by a cooperating teacher who is more familiar with performance assessments. Finally, we find that the relationships between student teaching environments and edTPA scores vary by characteristics of the candidate. This study reinforces prior work on the importance of learning environments to teacher development and the importance of preparation programs securing placements in high-quality learning environments. Our results may also have implications for the use of performance assessments by states and preparation programs.
