  Abstract
                  <p>Public media both reflects and shapes societal perceptions and attitudes. Teachers and others around students in mathematics classrooms have expectations for the students, projected with what appears in these media. We are most concerned about the expectations placed on students who are identified with minoritized groups—particularly students who are Indigenous or migrated to Norway. We investigate how minoritized group contexts and mathematics education appear together in Norwegian news media texts. Our analysis uses the notion of storylines to describe the expectations about minoritized groups that news media project. We found seven entangled storylines: “the majority language and culture are keys to learning and knowing mathematics,” “mathematics is language- and culture-neutral,” “minoritized groups’ mathematics achievements are linked to culture and gender,” “extraordinary measures are needed to teach students from minoritized groups mathematics,” “students from minoritized groups underachieve,” “students from minoritized groups put in extraordinary effort and time to learn mathematics,” and “minoritized mathematics students are motivated by gratitude.”</p>

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 319-343, June 2022. <br>The revealed preference approach in economics is central to the empirical analysis of consumer behavior. In this article, we introduce the commands checkax, aei, and powerps  as a bundle within the package rpaxioms. The first command allows a user to test whether consumer expenditure data satisfy several revealed preference axioms; the second command calculates measures of goodness of fit when the data violate these axioms; and the third command calculates power against uniformly random behavior as well as predictive success for each axiom. We illustrate the commands using individual-level experimental data and household-level aggregate consumption data.

Spatial regressions can be estimated using the spregress, spxtregress, and spivregress  commands. These commands allow users to fit spatial autoregressive models in cross-sectional and panel data. However, they are designed to estimate regressions with continuous dependent variables. Although binary spatial regressions are important in applied econometrics, they cannot be estimated in Stata. Therefore, I introduce spatbinary, a Stata command that allows users to fit spatial logit and probit models.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 430-445, June 2022. <br>I introduce binscatterhist, a command that extends the functionality of the popular binscatter command (Stepner, 2013, Statistical Software Components S457709, Department of Economics, Boston College). binscatter allows researchers to summarize the relationship between two variables in an informative and versatile way by collapsing scattered points into bins. However, information about the variables’ frequencies gets lost in the process. binscatterhist solves this issue by allowing the user to further enrich the graphs by plotting the variables’ underlying distribution. The binscatterhist command includes options for different regression methods, including reghdfe (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College) and areg, and robust and clustered standard errors, with automatic reporting of estimation results and sample size.

This command produces estimates, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals for the average treatment effect. The utility of the command is demonstrated with both simulated and real data of right heart catheterization. These illustrations show that the proposed estimator implemented by the robustate command indeed exhibits more robustness against limited overlap than the traditional inverse-probability weighting estimator. The main method of the command is proposed in Sasaki and Ura (2022, Econometric Theory 38: 66–112).

  Educational Researcher, Volume 51, Issue 5, Page 336-351, June/July 2022. <br>Trans-informed administrative guidance introduces concepts from trans studies to educational leaders, but researchers have relatively ignored these policy implementation tools. This content analysis describes the design of administrative guidance using a representative sample of 112 Illinois districts: the who, what, how, and why of supporting transgender students. The results substantiated evidence of trans-informed guidance that introduced complex gender “definitions” and legitimized students’ identity. Many of these same texts also included barriers to supporting students with administrative gatekeeping, definitions reinforcing the gender binary, and mandates to involve parents in access decisions. All but one district (96%) highlighted existing state and local policies to motivate administrative actions around 13 issues. A minority of the texts provided specific directions to guide decision-making and reform efforts. This paper includes areas of concern and suggestions as policymakers initiate gender reforms.

  Educational Researcher, Volume 51, Issue 5, Page 324-335, June/July 2022. <br>This qualitative study examines elementary teachers’ strategies for supporting trans and/or gender-expansive elementary students. The findings come from observations and interviews with a purposive sample of 31 teachers from five elementary schools with principals whom parents characterized as supporting their transgender and/or gender-expansive children. Findings indicate that elementary teachers used three broad strategies to support transgender and/or gender-expansive students. Teachers decreased gendered practices, increased discussions about gender, and affirmed children’s gender identity and expression. The consistency of teachers’ efforts to support trans and/or gender-expansive students was challenged by entrenched habits and their beliefs about the relevance of supportive practices. The study results contribute to the nascent knowledge base on educational practices that may improve the conditions for transgender and/or gender-expansive elementary school students.

  Abstract
                  <p>This study presents the views of stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa SSA on the present status of practical physics teaching in the secondary schools of the region and the obstacles to improvement. Their views have been analysed to establish critical factors that govern practice and have guided the formulation of a system description of the influences on the learning of practical physics. This study puts systemic understanding in the foreground and argues that such insights are critical to future reforms. Data were collected from four countries in SSA. Qualitative data were gathered from student focus groups and semi-structured interviews with school staff, ministry officials and educationalists. Illustrative quotes are reported extensively in the paper. The comments were transcribed and coded to identify common themes and factors. Quantitative surveys were carried out with students and physics teachers. The range of data acquisition is crucial in offering conclusions and suggestions that are of broader SSA relevance. The study confirms the expected wide gap between practices in the countries studied and economically developed countries. This gap is attributable to lack of material resource, limited teacher skills and staff development, ambivalent attitudes to practical work, prioritisation of ‘theory’, lack of interest in inquiry, neglect of relevant assessment and absence of relevant employment. An influence diagram was generated showing the strong connections between these and wider social and cultural factors. The study shows that effective reform requires a broad and politically attractive change.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 269-292, June 2022. <br>Commonly used unit-root tests in time-series analysis—such as the Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron tests—use a null hypothesis that the series contains a unit root. Such tests have low power against the alternative—when a time series is near integrated or highly autoregressive—implying that they do poorly in distinguishing such a series from having a unit root. Kwiatkowski et al. (1992, Journal of Econometrics 54: 159–178) introduced the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test, in which the null hypothesis is that the series is stationary, to deal with this problem. One shortcoming of the presently available Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test in Stata is that it uses asymptotic critical values regardless of the sample size. This poses a problem in that researchers—especially social scientists—are often presented with short time series. I introduce kpsstest, a command that extends the previous implementation by including an option for a zero-mean-stationary null hypothesis, generating sample and test-specific critical values, and reporting appropriate p-values.

  The Stata Journal, Volume 22, Issue 2, Page 416-429, June 2022. <br>In statistical work, it is essential to have an overview of the data used. In, for example, biomedical articles, a standardized way of reporting summaries of continuous and categorical variables is “table 1”. This standardized way of reporting can be useful in most cases of statistical work. The basetable command is a flexible and straightforward way to build and format such table reports. The final reports are easy to style into Stata Markup and Control Language, commaseparated values, HyperText Markup Language, LATEX or TEX, or Markdown and, for example, save into a file specified by the using modifier. Also, it is possible to export the reports created by basetable into Excel worksheets. Because of the General Data Protection Regulation, it has become necessary to blur information on individuals when making reports; in basetable, there are options to blur both categorical and continuous data.

However, in the presence of noncompliance, this can often lead to biased estimates because intention-to-treat analysis completely ignores varying levels of actual treatment received. This is a known issue that can be overcome by adopting the complier average causal effect approach, which estimates the effect the trial had on the individuals who complied with the protocol. When compliance is unobserved in the control group, the complier average causal effect estimate can be obtained via a latent class specification using the gsem command.

The sivqr command offers several advantages over the existing ivqreg and ivqreg2 commands for estimating this instrumental variables quantile regression model, which complements the alternative “triangular model” behind cqiv and the “local quantile treatment effect” model of ivqte. Computationally, sivqr implements the smoothed estimator of Kaplan and Sun (2017, Econometric Theory 33: 105–157), who show that smoothing improves both computation time and statistical accuracy. Standard errors are computed analytically or by Bayesian bootstrap; for nonindependent and identically distributed sampling, sivqr is compatible with bootstrap. I discuss syntax and the underlying methodology, and I compare sivqr with other commands in an example.

This brief describes the demographic characteristics of a non-random sample of 296 trans PK–12 school workers (i.e., teachers, administrators, staff) in the United States and Canada and reports their workplace experiences and the structural and social supports for trans employees compared to trans students. The analysis suggests that although most respondents are satisfied with their role, they experience high levels of discrimination and harassment, and there is a lack of administrative guidance for trans staff compared to trans students. The brief concludes with a discussion of the implications for school leadership and policy.

  Educational Researcher, Volume 51, Issue 5, Page 307-314, June/July 2022. <br>Over the past decade, public awareness of transgender people has rapidly increased. Yet people who do not conform to the expectations of their assigned gender often face social prejudice and structural marginalization. Within this context, an increasing number of education researchers have shown interest in taking up questions related to transgender communities. Although there is great potential for education researchers to play a useful role in cultivating trans-competent educational environments, this heightened engagement raises new challenges. How can education researchers design methodologies that avoid reinforcing the structures and epistemologies that have done harm to trans people? This article places that question in historical context through an overview of the relationship between transgender people and social science research over the last century, and the emergence of transgender studies as a response to that history. Then, the article presents a consideration of the role of education research in bridging tensions between the fields of social science and transgender studies.
