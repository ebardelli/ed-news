  Abstract
                  <p>In this paper, the construct of ‘uncertainty’ in professional mathematics is investigated in relation to mathematical creativity. Specific focus is on ‘Big C’ research mathematicians’ conceptions of what uncertainty means and ways in which it influences their research. Based on the hypothesis that uncertainty is both a catalyst and a necessary condition for creativity, a qualitative research design was used to obtain and analyze data from a 4-year study involving 18 research mathematicians who were at the forefront of their research domains. Data analysis using analytic induction confirmed the hypothesis that uncertainty plays an important role as a catalyst of mathematical creativity. The emergent categories from qualitative analysis revealed a dialectic or tension between (1) logic versus heuristics (synthetic versus analytic), (2) learner-researcher and researcher-learner transition, (3) axiom tweaking versus constraints. The findings of the study indicate that textbooks, unexpected moments, risk taking, and a community of support play a crucial role and characterize the interplay of uncertainty with mathematical creativity. The schema for understanding the dialectics of uncertainty sheds new light on an hitherto unexplored aspect of mathematical creativity, namely, uncertainty, vital for the development of mathematicians as researchers in addition to the growth of their discipline.</p>

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>Although complex reasons exist for the poor state of education in socio-economically challenged communities in South Africa, improving parental support to learners is one approach to buffer contextual adversities. Yet, historically, collaboration between school and parent has been problematic. We hypothesized that a participatory action research approach might be useful to develop positive relations between teachers and parents. We report on the benefits of a PAR project undertaken by seven community parents and five teachers to enhance learner support in a primary school situated in a low-income area. Thematic analysis of focus group interviews with participants, triangulated by transcriptions of a final project workshop, revealed that participation in the PAR process enabled i) the development of contextually relevant content for an educational programme; ii) change in the assumptions of parents and teachers about their respective roles in supporting the child; iii) the personal/technical skills development of participants; and iv) positive outcomes beyond the project. The insights gain from this study highlight the benefits of PAR to enable schools to harness the wealth of knowledge and skills that exist in their community to enhance learner support and improve the quality of teaching and learning.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>The Teacher of the Year (TOY) program is the longest-standing teacher recognition program in the United States. The purpose of this study is to describe the characteristics of state and national TOY awardees and the schools in which they teach. To accomplish this aim, we develop a new data set including the characteristics of all TOY awardees and their schools from 1988 to 2019. Using descriptive and regression analysis, we find that TOY awardees are most likely to teach at the high school level, while the most common subjects taught were elementary education, English language arts, natural sciences, and, for National TOY awardees, social studies. They also have a greater probability of being selected from schools with a smaller fraction of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and higher student enrollments. We discuss how these differences may impede the TOY program’s efforts to amplify teachers’ voice in education policymaking.

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>Research on education in new immigrant destinations has highlighted the importance of educators’ professional missions and expertise in shaping their receptivity toward newcomers. Less attention has been given to how educators’ social identities, especially in relation to newcomers, influence how they perceive their role in serving the population. Drawing on the theory of representative bureaucracy, this qualitative study explores how educators’ social identities shaped their identification with and orientation toward addressing the needs of immigrant-origin English learners in one new-destination high school. Results indicate that educators framed their orientation toward serving the population as a moral imperative, a professional responsibility, or a legal obligation. These orientations influenced how educators perceived their role in addressing newcomers’ needs. This study offers implications for educational practice and provides avenues for future research on education in new immigrant destinations.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This article presents the findings of a systematic qualitative analysis of research in the ethics of digital trace data use in learning and education. From the resulting analysis of 77 peer-reviewed studies, we (1) map the characteristics of research by study type, academic community, institutional setting, and national context; (2) identify the primary ethical concerns and related responses; and (3) highlight the research gaps. Four areas of focus are identified in this emerging area: (1) privacy, informed consent, and data ownership; (2) validity and integrity; (3) ethical decision making; and (4) governance and accountability. We highlight the lack of evidence particularly for preschool and school-aged children and the disparate communities working in this domain, and we suggest a more cohesive approach, where the wider learning and educational ecosystem is recognized, explicit engagement with ethical theory is central, and mid- to long-term ethical issues are considered alongside immediate concerns.

  Action Research, Ahead of Print. <br>An overarching component of PAR is that there should be participant engagement between researchers and other participants as members of a/the community under inquiry. This expectation while powerful, can also prove to be prohibitive for studies seeking to engage communities with stigmatized and/or criminalized identities, which was the case as I sought to engage a PAR methodology with college student sex workers. As such, along with study collaborators, we imagine and develop a power-conscious collaborative process that is useful for researchers wishing to embrace a collaborative ethic, when the community component of PAR might be unsuitable or unattainable. Specifically, this process creates conditions whereby the researcher can be cognizant of power relations and disrupt the prevalent researcher/researched dichotomy and more deeply invite subjects of research to become collaborators and share power within the inquiry.

  Abstract
                  <p>In the first months of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic became a top concern worldwide, media coverage became full of information that demands mathematical literacy, or numeracy, to interpret. In this study, we examine the public’s understanding of mathematical notions that are required for understanding the pandemic and predicting its spread. We also explore its correlations with several variables: age group and gender, educational attainment in mathematics, and mathematics identity. To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey focusing on mathematical knowledge relevant to the pandemic. The survey was distributed to a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population (n = 439). Findings showed that participants’ educational attainment in mathematics was positively correlated with their success in the mathematical media literacy tasks. However, even those with high attainment levels did not always perform well. Moreover, the explanatory variable with the strongest relationship to mathematical media literacy was found to be participants’ mathematical identity. These results suggest that school mathematics, especially in its high levels, may prepare adults to understand critical information important for their well-being, such as at a time of global pandemic. However, they also demonstrate that a weak mathematical identity may significantly hinder adults’ engagement with such information.</p>

  AERA Open, Volume 7, Issue , January-December 2021. <br>We examine how teachers from two alternative preparation programs—Teach for America (TFA) and Kansas City Teacher Residency (KCTR)—contribute to the teacher labor market in and around Kansas City, Missouri. TFA and KCTR teachers are more likely than other teachers to work in charter schools and, more broadly, in schools with more low-income, low-performing, and underrepresented minority (Black and Hispanic) students. Teachers from both programs are more racially/ethnically diverse than the larger local-area teaching workforce, but only KCTR teachers are more diverse than other teachers in the same districts where they work. We estimate value added to achievement for teachers in both programs compared with nonprogram teachers, with the caveat that our KCTR sample for this analysis is small. In math, we find large positive impacts of TFA and KCTR teachers on test score growth; in English language arts also, we estimate positive impacts, but they are smaller.

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>The transition to new assessments aligned to the Common Core State Standards was a significant turning point in the standards’ implementation. Concerns about the transition led districts to suspend the use of value-added scores for evaluating teachers, but changes to other measures, such as classroom observations, were rare. Using data from the Washington, DC Public Schools, I evaluate the effect of the assessment transition on teachers’ practice. I find substantial declines in instructional practice, ranging from 13% to 20% of a standard deviation, for teachers in tested grades and subjects when the new exam was introduced. These results suggest that policymakers should consider the ramifications of testing changes on a wider array of teaching outcomes than value-added scores alone.

  Abstract
                  <p>In this article, three of David Clarke’s long time collaborators offer perspectives on how David shaped and continued to influence projects in which they were involved, over a 30 year period. The three sections of the article focus on David’s contributions to original research on high stakes assessment, research on the development and use of assessment alternatives to traditional pen and paper assessments, and research in three smaller projects involving the use of open-ended questions, the implementation of the Australian Curriculum: Mathematics, and the complexity of the mathematics classroom, respectively. Through discussion of these various national and international projects, the authors provide examples of David’s capacity to synthesise theoretical ideas, to appreciate the implications for classroom practice, and to communicate both perspectives to researchers, teacher educators and teachers. The authors argue that David’s capacity to distil crucially important ideas into brief, highly insightful statements, was fundamental to the enactment and effectiveness of both research studies and projects for the teaching profession.</p>

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>Background:Propensity score analysis (PSA) is a popular method to remove selection bias due to covariates in quasi-experimental designs, but it requires handling of missing data on covariates before propensity scores are estimated. Multiple imputation (MI) and single imputation (SI) are approaches to handle missing data in PSA.Objectives:The objectives of this study are to review MI-within, MI-across, and SI approaches to handle missing data on covariates prior to PSA, investigate the robustness of MI-across and SI with a Monte Carlo simulation study, and demonstrate the analysis of missing data and PSA with a step-by-step illustrative example.Research design:The Monte Carlo simulation study compared strategies to impute missing data in continuous and categorical covariates for estimation of propensity scores. Manipulated conditions included sample size, the number of covariates, the size of the treatment effect, missing data mechanism, and percentage of missing data. Imputation strategies included MI-across and SI by joint modeling or multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE).Results:The results indicated that the MI-across method performed well, and SI also performed adequately with smaller percentages of missing data. The illustrative example demonstrated MI and SI, propensity score estimation, calculation of propensity score weights, covariate balance evaluation, estimation of the average treatment effect on the treated, and sensitivity analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.

  Abstract
                  <p>Inquiry into the teaching and learning of mathematics is a central aspect of the work of both the mathematics teacher and the mathematics education researcher, yet there are profound differences between the practices and processes underlying educational inquiries within each community. These differences are known to hinder implementation of research, yet they can also become a valuable resource. This paper explores a particular model of implementation of research: mathematics teachers adopt and adapt practices and processes of disciplined educational inquiry in a co-learning partnership with mathematics education researchers. We present a narrative inquiry of a teacher–researcher community that designed and studied classroom activities aimed at encouraging students to ask meaningful mathematical questions. The data analysis, informed by the literature on boundary objects and boundary crossing, highlights how the teachers and researchers leveraged their different processes and practices of educational inquiry as a resource in their collaborative inquiry. We conclude by suggesting that informed and thoughtful attention to the differences between teacher inquiry and disciplined inquiry may support and enhance mathematics education research implementation.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Practitioners and scholars have argued that youth participatory action research (YPAR) challenges systemic injustice in education, as youth and adults research mechanisms of oppression and propose recommendations. However, oftentimes YPAR does not lead to new policies, as institutional decision-makers ignore youth’s moral pleas and empirical evidence. In this conceptual article, we propose a consideration of the ways in which YPAR can mobilize power bases using youth organizing and institutionally sanctioned decision-making. We argue that being attuned to power bases provides YPAR groups a more reliable means, in comparison to moral pleas, to move from YPAR findings to shifts in policy and practice.

  Abstract
                  <p>Although mathematical modeling plays an important role in many curricula worldwide, significant discrepancies persist in the importance of mathematical modeling in ordinary mathematics classrooms and teacher education. This paper compares pre-service mathematics teachers’ professional mathematical modeling competencies in three different regions—Germany, Mainland China, and Hong Kong—where educational and cultural traditions differ, including the role of mathematical modeling. In total, 232 pre-service mathematics teachers from the three regions completed a modeling task covering mathematics content knowledge (MCK) of modeling and mathematical pedagogical content knowledge (MPCK) of modeling. The results show that pre-service teachers from Germany demonstrated the strongest MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling; by contrast, pre-service mathematics teachers from Mainland China and Hong Kong demonstrated relatively weaker MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling. MCK and MPCK of mathematical modeling were also found to be unevenly developed at different competence levels for the three regions. These differences may be attributed to the history of mathematical modeling in mathematics curricula, teacher education, and teaching culture in these three regions.</p>
