  Abstract
                  <p>For many decades, problem solving has been a focus of elementary mathematics education reforms. Despite this, in many education systems, the prevalent approach to mathematics problem solving treats it as an isolated activity instead of an integral part of teaching and learning. In this study, two mathematics teacher educators introduced 19 Irish elementary teachers to an alternative problem solving approach, namely Teaching Through Problem Solving (TTP), using Lesson Study (LS) as the professional development model. The findings suggest that the opportunity to experience TTP first-hand within their schools supported teachers in appreciating the affordances of various TTP practices. In particular, teachers reported changes in their beliefs regarding problem solving practice alongside developing problem posing knowledge. Of particular note was teachers’ contention that engaging with TTP practices through LS facilitated them to appreciate their students’ problem solving potential to the fullest extent. However, the planning implications of the TTP approach presented as a persistent barrier.</p>

  Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Ahead of Print. <br>Two independent statistical tests of item compromise are presented, one based on the test takers’ responses and the other on their response times (RTs) on the same items. The tests can be used to monitor an item in real time during online continuous testing but are also applicable as part of post hoc forensic analysis. The two test statistics are simple intuitive quantities as the sum of the responses and RTs observed for the test takers on the item. Common features of the tests are ease of interpretation and computational simplicity. Both tests are uniformly most powerful under the assumption of known ability and speed parameters for the test takers. Examples of power functions for items with realistic parameter values suggest maximum power for 20–30 test takers with item preknowledge for the response-based test and 10–20 test takers for the RT-based test.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>BackgroundU.S. state legislatures fill a vital role in supporting the use of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) through statutes and regulations (mandates).ObjectiveThe study determined the terms used by selected states to describe EBIs and how those terms are defined in mandates.Research MethodsThe mandates of eight purposely selected states were accessed and coded using the Westlaw Legal Research Database.ResultsConsiderable variation was found in the terms used by states to describe EBIs. Although “evidence-based” was the most frequently utilized term (60% of mandates), an additional 29 alternative terms appeared with varying frequencies. Most terms were simply mentioned, with no further definition or elaboration. When terms were further defined or elaborated, the majority were defined using numerous and different types of external sources or references. Three approaches were found in the mandates defining EBIs: “single definition,” “hierarchies of evidence levels,” and “best available evidence”; the states differed considerably in the approaches used in their mandates.ConclusionsThe variations in EBI-related terminology across states and within states, coupled with a lack of elaboration on the meaning of important terms and the predominant use of external rather than internal guidelines, may be a source of confusion for behavioral health provider agencies that seek direction about what constitutes an EBI. Prior studies indicate that many agencies may lack staff with the technical ability to adequately evaluate what constitutes an EBI. Thus, lack of clear guidance from official state government mandates may impede the implementation of EBIs within states.

  Abstract
                  <p>Various intervention programs for fostering at-risk students’ understanding of basic concepts (such as place value understanding or meanings of multiplication and division) have been developed and evaluated. However, little is known about the teacher expertise required to enact these intervention programs, and how this teacher expertise can be promoted. The article suggests a conceptual model for teacher expertise for fostering at-risk students’ understanding based on three recurrent jobs: (a) specify learning content (in basic concepts), (b) monitor students’ learning progress (in basic concepts) and (3) enhance students’ understanding (of basic concepts). Mastering these jobs with productive teaching practices involves four orientations in particular (conceptual rather than procedural orientation, diagnostic rather than syllabus-led orientation, communicative rather than individualistic orientation, and long-term rather than short-term orientation) as well as detailed pedagogical content categories for unpacking relevant knowledge elements. The paper reports on the professional development program Mastering Math which aims at promoting this expertise and its evaluation using a pre–post-design. For 95 participating teachers, the practices for specifying goals and monitoring and enhancing at-risk students’ understanding were captured in self-reports and situated in vignette-based activities for eliciting diagnostic judgments. Teachers’ development across different aspects of their expertise from the beginning and the end of the 1-year PD reveals the first quantitative evidence that the PD was effective in promoting growth of expertise. Whereas specifying and monitoring practices had substantially developed, the enhancement practices were hindered by a persistent short-term orientation.</p>

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 37-42, May 2022. <br>Preparing students for postsecondary life is among the most important roles that a high school plays. And yet, how schools approach this work, what schools should be preparing students for, and who should be responsible for this work have long been contested. Jeremy Greenfield draws on an emerging body of psychological literature exploring purpose and offers a new way to conceive of postsecondary preparation. Rather than focusing solely on college or career preparation, high schools ought to support students to identify their interests and build an emergent set of long term goals as part of purpose-first model of postsecondary support.

James Kim and Mary Burkhauser explain that, to help students apply what they learn from one reading task to another reading task, educators should consider developing thematic lessons that organize knowledge around a schema, help students connect new knowledge to a schema, and measure students’ ability to transfer knowledge to novel comprehension tasks. They encourage educators to consider how they might use their knowledge of the role of schemas in reading comprehension to improve children’s ability to read for understanding.

The science of reading is a broad body of research, she explains, that includes not just alphabetics, phonics, and word reading, which receive the most attention in the media. Actual science of reading research also incorporates findings related to motivation, dyslexia, digital texts, and multilingualism. In addition, effective reading instruction does not follow a simple prescription but leaves room for teacher discretion.

Tips for such conversations are helpful, but a more robust, research-based framework is needed. Rolland’s framework for rich talk suggests that conversations be adaptive, back-and-forth, and child-driven. Rick talk expands on children’s utterances, explores their thoughts and questions, and evaluates. Teachers can also benefit from conversations among themselves that use these strategies.

  Abstract
                  <p>The purpose of this study was firstly to investigate the mathematical metacognitive characteristics of high-efficiency students by comparing high-efficiency and low-efficiency students. Secondly, the aim was to explore the pathways of mathematical metacognition of efficient mathematics learners in mathematics achievement. In this study, second-year Chinese middle school students were divided into a high-efficiency group (n = 297) and a low-efficiency group (n = 203) according to their learning efficiency in mathematics. The results indicated that the mathematical metacognitive knowledge and mathematical metacognitive monitoring of the students with high efficiency in mathematics learning were better than those of the other group. Their mathematical metacognitive characteristics were mainly reflected in the five dimensions of regulation, inspection, knowledge about individuals, knowledge about tasks, and knowledge about strategies. Furthermore, path analysis revealed that both mathematical metacognitive monitoring and mathematical metacognitive experience directly affected the mathematics achievement of students in the highly effective group. Mathematical metacognitive knowledge had an indirect effect on mathematics achievement. The findings imply that teachers should focus on the guidance of mathematical metacognition in mathematics instruction.</p>

  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>Although Black students may share race-related experiences at predominantly White institutions (PWIs), they are a heterogeneous community with diverse identity beliefs, goals, and expectations about college. In the current study, we foreground how Black students at PWIs understand their racialized identities in relation to one another and within the broader university context. Drawing from interview data with 32 Black undergraduate students, we explore intraracial academic and social norms at two PWIs, with a particular focus on how students’ intersectional identities inform their relationships and experiences with other Black students. We add to the growing literature that actively challenges the homogenization of Black student populations and discuss how intraracial norms contribute to students’ campus adjustment and sense of belonging.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 14-19, May 2022. <br>Recent stories raising the alarm about students’ poor reading skills and calling for greater attention to the “science of reading” represent the latest round in the ongoing “reading wars.” Going back at least as far as the 1950s, scholars, pundits and policy makers have debated which teaching strategies are most successful at helping students become proficient readers. However, Leah Durán and Michiko Hikida argue that these debates fail to get at the root issues behind students’ poor reading performance. Even when schools with the lowest reading scores implement science-backed pedagogical approaches, these shifts do not make up for structural inequalities in facilities, resources, and teacher quality. Reading scores reflect problems rooted in class and race inequalities that cannot be resolved through pedagogy alone.

  Phi Delta Kappan, Volume 103, Issue 8, Page 25-31, May 2022. <br>Children’s development as readers is a complex and multifaceted process. Rather than emphasizing individual components of reading instruction, Melanie R. Kuhn and Katherine A. Dougherty Stahl argue that it is more effective to view the reading process as a reciprocal or interactive one in which readers’ development in one component of reading can support their growth in other components. Further, while some components need to be consistently emphasized (i.e., vocabulary, comprehension) across readers’ developmental path, others should be focused on at specific developmental moments (e.g., alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness). The authors present a general overview of how readers develop and discuss how to flexibly design instruction to meet students’ needs, enhance student learning, and better ensure all students become skilled readers.

Teresa Preston chronicles the history of the reading wars as they played out in Kappan. Researchers and scholars have debated the merits of phonics, wholeword, and whole-language approaches to reading, as well as the nature of research and instruction in general. But some have wondered how valuable the debate is to educators looking for guidance to help the children in their districts and schools.
