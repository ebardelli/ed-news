  American Educational Research Journal, Ahead of Print. <br>This investigation studied the effects of the Multiple Literacies in Project-Based Learning science intervention on third graders’ academic, social, and emotional learning. This intervention includes four science units and materials, professional learning, and post-unit assessments; features of project-based learning; three-dimensional learning (National Research Council, 2012); and the performance expectations from the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). The intervention was evaluated with a cluster randomized control trial in 46 Michigan schools with 2,371 students. Results show that students who received the intervention had higher scores on a standardized science test (0.277 standard deviation) and reported higher levels of self-reflection and collaboration when involved in science activities.

  Educational Researcher, Ahead of Print. <br>Public schools and districts use social media to share announcements and communicate with parents and the community, but alongside such uses run risks to students’ privacy. Using a novel data set of 18 million posts on Facebook by schools and school districts in the United States, we sought to establish how frequently photos of students were shared. Through sequential mixed-methods, we estimated that around 4.9 million posts included identifiable images of students and that approximately 726,000 of these posts also included students’ first and last names and their approximate location. We discuss these findings’ implications from a data ethics perspective.

Specifically, we illustrate these tensions across three dimensions of our work: (a) establishing critical commitments with K-12 partners; (b) building organizational capacity for critical racial analysis; and (c) confronting internal and external resistance. Throughout, we highlight approaches for leveraging the positionality and expertise of our partners to create the conditions for promoting and sustaining racial justice work in schools.

Unfortunately, research on this issue is still scarce. In this sense, the four papers included in this section are welcome because they approach this research problem from different perspectives.

This analysis is inspired both by the “Series of problems at the crossroad of cultures” interdisciplinary history of sciences project, in which texts from various cultures structured around problems were analysed, and by ongoing mathematics educational research on the Hungarian Guided Discovery approach, where “series of problems” play a central role in the planning and implementation of teaching trajectories. I show how a dialog between the analysis of Clairaut’s historical text and mathematics educational research contributes to the reflection on the construction and analysis of inquiry based teaching trajectories in mathematics education.</p>

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>Policies restricting bilingual education have yielded to policy frameworks touting its benefits. This shift corresponds with evolving lines of debate, focusing now on how bilingual education can best support racialized bilingual learners. One element of this new debate is the perspective on language underlying curriculum in bilingual programs, with a focus on translanguaging– normalization of the language practices of bilingual communities and positing that bilinguals draw from a singular linguistic repertoire. This article examines initiatives undertaken in California between 2010 and 2019 using Critical Policy Analysis. The work highlights that while opportunities for translanguaging have arisen, tensions between heteroglossic perspectives and the impulses toward standardization and commodification of language undermine such possibilities, and that notable gaps remain between teacher preparation frameworks and intended pedagogical practice.

  AERA Open, Volume 8, Issue , January-December 2022. <br>Committing to a major is a fateful step in an undergraduate education, yet the relationship between courses taken early in an academic career and ultimate major issuance remains little studied at scale. Using transcript data capturing the academic careers of 26,892 undergraduates enrolled at a private university between 2000 and 2020, we describe enrollment histories by using natural-language methods and vector embeddings to forecast terminal major on the basis of course sequences beginning at college entry. We find that (a) a student’s very first enrolled course predicts their major 30 times better than random guessing and more than one-third better than majority-class voting, (b) modeling strategies substantially influence forecasting metrics, and (c) course portfolios vary substantially within majors, such that students with the same major exhibit relatively modest overlap.

We estimated what percentage of Title I funds at a large school district are invested in practices supported by a single study meeting one of the top three tiers of evidence as defined by ESSA. Over 95% met this bar. When studies about each practice from four research repositories were considered, the percentage of funds invested in practices with overall positive or mostly positive ratings fell below 60%. These proportions did not change substantially after the introduction of ESSA.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>This paper describes how a multi-armed randomized experiment was used to test multiple variants of a behaviorally informed marketing strategy. In particular, we tested whether specific behavioral messages could be used to increase demand for a safety consultation service offered by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Our experiment used a partial factorial design with 19 study arms and a very large research sample—97,182 establishments—to test the impact of various message, formats, and delivery modes compared with an existing (not behaviorally informed) informational brochure and a no-marketing counterfactual. A secondary research goal was to predict the impact of the most successful marketing strategy (i.e., combination of message, format, and mode) so that OSHA would know what to anticipate if that strategy were implemented at scale. We used two related (but distinct) methods to address these two goals. Both begin with a common mixed (i.e., fixed and random effects) ANOVA model. We addressed the first research goal primarily from the fixed effects; we addressed the second research goal by calculating best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs) from the full mixed model, where the BLUP involves “shrinkage” as in empirical Bayes (EB) approaches. Marketing via brochures was effective overall, nearly doubling the rate of requests for services. However, the behaviorally informed materials performed no better than OSHA’s existing informational brochure. This study also highlights the conditions under which a factorial design can be used to efficiently address questions about which of several program variants are most effective.

  Evaluation Review, Ahead of Print. <br>The sluggish progress concerning SDG-9 and SDG 13 has made South Asia an epicentre of household and ambient greenhouse gases emissions. Furthermore, the regional progress concerning attainment of SDG-3 is considerably low. The major research objectives are twofold. First, to explore the impact of GHGs emissions from agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing sector on disaggregated life expectancy. Second, to examine the mitigating impact of renewable energy use, trade integration, and human capital development for practice policy recommendations. These research objectives are realized by employing recently advanced cross-sectional auto regressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) model on panel data of five South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka from 1990 to 2019. The estimation outcome reveals that the emissions from transportation, manufacturing, and agricultural sectors significantly deteriorate healthy life expectancy of male and female healthy life expectancy in South Asia with different intensity. Especially, we find that long-run impact of GHG is more profound on male healthy life expectancy than female life expectancy. The result further shows that renewable energy and human capital substantially improve healthy life expectancy, whereas the effects of trade integration are insignificant. The finding of moderating variables shows that renewable energy, human capital development, and trade integration have high potential to reduce GHGs emissions. The findings of this study urge South Asia for investments in human capital development and renewable energy along with fostering regional integration to decrease GHG and improve healthy life expectancy.

  Review of Educational Research, Ahead of Print. <br>This systematic literature review examines research on U.S. professional development (PD) in which practicing teachers are asked to engage explicitly with race and racism. Using Kennedy’s PD theories of action, this review examines 64 studies published from 1981 to 2019 and analyzes race-related PD goals, pedagogical approaches, and documented outcomes of PD. The body of scholarship shows an array of PD program goals, often-limited pedagogical explicitness and detail, and descriptive and developmental outcomes. Recent scholarship has centered racial-equity-oriented teachers and teachers of Color and identified PD characteristics associated with positive outcomes. Extant literature has seldom directly documented PD transfer and incorporation in schools or documented PD impact on students. Areas for future research include further leveraging scholarship on change processes including teacher learning and PD effectiveness, documenting teacher development beyond PD sessions, probing affordances of different PD settings and formats, and examining how PD ultimately impacts student experience.

  Educational Policy, Ahead of Print. <br>This Policy Discourse Analysis (PDA) explores 19 state legislative documents focused on the teaching of disability history in K-12 schools. Framed through critical perspectives on constructions of disability and race, alongside discourse theory, we iteratively analyzed these legislative documents to understand (a) how disability and disability history are constructed (particularly in relation to whiteness); and (b) the stated purpose of the legislation and who is meant to benefit materially as a result of the laws. We find the legislation upholds dominant notions of whiteness and ability as part of school curriculum, while simultaneously constructing disability history as in the past and disability justice as already achieved, centering the learning and awareness of white, nondisabled students. We offer discussion and implications for research and practice surrounding policy implementation of teaching disability history.
